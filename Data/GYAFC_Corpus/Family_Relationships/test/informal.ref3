if they've moved on then you probably should too
Ur punishment is no tube for a month.
If ya tell him it won't be crazy, cuz you've known each other a long time.

Do i break up with him cause of his mom?
make a move, she's into you or nit.

I feel like I keep getting tempted and it's tough being good.
Does it get comfortable or boring when you are a year in?
It is all about when you feel ready enough.
Duhhh... I want to meet some women.
It's just how it is.
it's ok to be online friends but gotta have limits
do u think u can picture having a family with him???
if he says no, hes not good enough to begin with
to tell u the truth youll learn.  but u gotta experience life

it depends on the woman and what she want
i know i have someone waiting for me at home.

only lil boyz not men
try something like would you like to hangout sometime
it could happen to anyone even me twice
you shouldn't feel obligated to go out with him
Well obviously you don't want to be with him otherwise you wouldn't be asking me that.
I hope this doesn't end.
Women just want a man to be open about his feelings.
Women like to be more into sex.
Keep trying to impress her.
Lean towards me and give me a soft peck right on the forehead.
I'm not like that, but there's a lot of them out there.
She's self centered and that shouldn't show up on a first date.
It depends on how much you are starting to get into this boy.
Thanks for the pep in advance!
Why would they want to get married?!?
Approach softly and chase us!
Do you have any idea why I married my husband?
Let's go to an amusement park or a museum.

that perfume is dope
You should practice unwrapping starbursts with your tongue. Chick dig it.
Most men don't care I think, but it really depends on the person.
It has nothing to do with being weak, obedient, or naive.
Don't get married too early in a relationship.
If you plan on cheating on your wife, you're not cool.
do the very best impression of yourself, and if he's down to clown he'll lip you up
you don't wanna be with anyone else but them
he's getting married, just stop
did you tell her that the day check-ins were annoying?
my neigbhor hit on me asap
Most teen boys enjoy teen girls who like sex.
He played basketball well.
Don't stress.
you must be a troll
if he liked you more than her, she'd have dumped him
fear, anger, revenge: these are the forces of the darkside
he loved me enough to close the long distant relationship from 1400 miles away to home
u been to a doc yet??
she's no shrew but that thin one was DEFINITELY!
dont waste MY time...go do something!
its like eating too much chocolate and they bitchin that u got fat
i went there and he was there
Go for it he single!
Men like him will beat their wives if they don’t obey
Do you think he’s hot or not??
If u haven’t yet, tell ur parents if you’re sure
sadly, you're going to get shut down by many people in your life.
do you think he's on the same page when it comes to the feels?
there's that four letter word that a man just can't say unless he really feels it.
he is totally digging you, so you gotta let him know.
I think everyone should keep their damn name.
Friends are forever, guys sleep around tho.
Think of it like love.
You gotta have your relationship ready for the four seasons.
Some guys like some girls, not all types tho.
If you want kids be a stay at home mom.
What do u think of the young guy with the older woman?
He just keeps going
U promised to stay faithful when u got married.  Remember that.
it'd have to be love there's no alternative
your self image is also important though
well I'm a girl and i say them things
girls can be just as preverted ;)
flowers are nice, tho they don't last super long...
there are movies i still haven't seen
she is so sweet, def the person you are looking for!
hey, use your BRAIN not your MANHOOD - maybe she loves you!
ur name sounds like a chick's name, bruh... no diss, tho
meh, don't waste your time calling him back
no women I got the hots for around, I picked my neighbor's old lady instead!
not gonna have a good marriage without trust & communication, dude
don't listen to ppls advice, most of the time they wrong
What do you think I should do to get wit her?
Maybe u should give a rose 2 show ur love 4 dem
it's weird but not bad weird.
Find what's right for both of you, dude.
They're not kids but we're more mature by far.
Yep, like when she puked.
Cause you know you should look for your love but carefully!!!
Need more info to help more...
Kissing is kissing, theres no right or wrong to it.
think it over, don't rush the decision

i think its more of a trust problem tbh
I need help figuring this out!
u better move on if that man don't want u
he aint interested either...
diy is the way 2 go
Why do you always work and fix things?
I really meant it when I told her I loved her.
It just seems like all the male seniors think all freshmen girls are easy.
How do I just kiss him?
You should just check the deleted items, it might be there.
i think you'll find a nice chick to go out with eventually
bad idea, you're not there for that crap
the list is endless, tbh
Brokebak mountain and stuff, but... you'll be ecstatic even if it is a dude
don't base your relationship on sex and you'll do fine
I'll tell her soon enough; she's my best friend after all and I know she will offer to help anyway.
You are correct Sir! Never ever ever look at your future wife before the wedding ceremony begins.
Keep calm, hold on, and you'll do great!
uhh it's just a small party for close family members...
Don't do it if you aren't sure about the performance portion.
I just got married actually.
it depends on how old they are and how they were raised.
youll have to decide a last name once u have kids.
Your kid is gunna have a really rough time with no fathe rin its life.
men that dont have hair are ugly to me, they look like a kid lol.

If you love him you need to get rid of your x
Best way to get hitched ... cheap and quick in Vegas!
i wanna know more about u

Just Lie and keep lying
I've never seen them perform so it extra awesome!
Wife doesn't wear that mess
we don't know how you look!
opposites attract and every pot has its lid
i think its better than my personal life
dont go to the same places with her and you did with your ex
talk with your bro and see if its ok
thats odd.. it worked for me in 3-5 days
It pisses me off when he teases you about small shit.
No, i am not hitched yet.
There are a ton of guys into big girls, and most are black men.
I usually use poems to express how I feel to women, and I wonder if anyone else has written one to someone special in their life.
I told her how I felt, and she told me she was afraid it would mess up our friendship.
Stay with him if you care about him, and you shouldn't care what others think.
Do they make fun of you when you and him are together?
I love them since I am a dude and no one said I needed a date.
Don't get married if you feel this way.
depends on whether a person is full of themself...
ya gotta move on and find someone who doesn't hate ya...
you should be to know her and then one of you guys will ask the other out!
i asked him he was blowin me off...
Maybe some younger sick guys like younger Asian chicks.
Make sure this is your choice.
tell him u want it casual
if he is not treating u well leave. u gotta be happy
its difficult and lots of problems
the past few years have been OK, but not always easy peasy.
srsly, it's been 4, maybe 5 years, and there hasn't been a day we haven't seen each other.
just think of me as the man of your dreams, and be mine.
it never hurt anyone to let their flirt flag fly!
stick to what you kno in your gut.
good luck babes!
well... ive been with this one girl 8 months and not kissed her, is it bad?
gotta be the girls decision!
IMO theyre better looking than other countries
it'd be fine the day after
just see if shes free for dinner and a movie
some men are inconsiderate assholes when it comes to women
can you speak english i have no idea what yr saying
I have never felt that, soz
gotta memba, no bird ever flown w/ 1 wing
i think bout this ALL THE TIME
if  u dont stop looking so down youll never find a significant other
i just met a chick and i wanna know if shes into it
Keep busy while waiting for the phone to do its thing.
Be yourself, don't change for anyone.
ladies who are 22 want  27 year old guys, but the 27 year old guys want the ladies younger than that.
If he don't appreciate you, leave him.
He might really love you. Or he's just doing it to hurt is dad.
Don't be such a weakling. If you say sorry to him without doing anything wrong you just humiliate yourself.
Do it before you run out of time
That girl doesn't need a man who is gonna betray her.
yo what a black girl say bout this
yo help me beat this chick at debate
they're pretty much dudes the same age as you, mostly
when are people ever going to understand?
Really, what am I gonna do?
ya go to a bar and drink till your drunk!
i acted that way with my current BF
if you gotta ask... then no...
don't sit around waiting till he realizes how great you are
thought I divorced them but it still goes on....
Have a good time it will be OK....
She will just think you are an ass if you do that.
if mom and pop don't like you just be friends with her friiends why?
for me - i woudn't marry a girl who woudn't change her last name but that's just me
you should try to date girls since guys offend you
my ex of 3 years of being together cheated on me
eh, i say give it 6 months - time will tell!!
here is how the one i like went
not all gentlemen break up
its fun to go there. lots to do
can u kiss on first date
i have a close female friend
the want to sex each other
Explain that breaking up was a big mistake, and you want to be with him.
I am too nice according to my friends, and i should say no to him.
theres alway san exception right?
some guys do but not every single one.
if you do that then you will be able to keep your last name.
say hello and ask if she has a bf
that turned me on, but i left
fat girls can be hot
All tha ppl here are not here for school.
If u practice over & over u will be able to unwrap bothcherry stems and starbursts with ur tongue like me.
U keep talkin to him so much, he gonna think you r his wife!
If you gimme your vote for best answer, I will pay the bill.
Looking in public is prolly the best idea, plus you will feel safe there..
Tease him see if he bites....
then I don't have to ask anyone direct.
Say yes it'll be fun!
She never forgets when I screw up.
how do i approach her so she doesn't think i'm a guy with bad intentions??
as a guy... let me enlighten you
No prob, you’re just 13.
Trail ride with a friend every time all the time.
If it’s meant to be they everything will work out.
Eye contact, it’s what it’s all abouut.
He's a weakling, I can pick him up!
He will have to start over to get your trust back.
My boyfriend and I were in second, fourth and eighth grades together.
Why would you wanna go out with her?
Hopefully you'll review this thoroughly.
Play t or d together.
Gotta confirm it and go from there.
That's dumb u need a theory class 4 that.
quit if you eat something like that
I want some from that girl.
be blunt and confront him, that's how you will know
Jamie's going to ask Rubi out.
both of you need to have some guts and end this thing
could be interesting for them to learn about it...
he DRIBBLES he SHOOTS he SCORES!!! TWO POINTS!
do guys really like big girls?
he def loves you too, but time will tell...
if he repsects you he'll get it
we're the source of our own sin
that response works for me
u can still like him. but move on
a smart girl is hot
its bad they cant take her out
my sister closes her eyes when she is ready to kiss
LOL i met my last bf driving in a roundabout!
He’s getting hitched this month
should I move on and forget about it?
U replaying everything u did to me in your mind?
it is like ur married
why didnt u break up
he may want more space
tell more peeps
you just gotta take it one step at a time and remember he got a good thing
u gotta say "Hey booo when we goin to dinner?"
nah, not if u gotta ask
u gotta go 2 school and u can still com home to ur friends and fam
i didn't wanna have sex ever agin
let him come to you. if you go to him, you'll look crazy about him
some people dont do that bc of their relgiion
I hope you're proud of yourself!
It's up to the individual, it's their choice.
If you think about it it might help you decide whether to trust him or not.
I didn't mean to ask if you thought of women as sexy and beautiful.
you need to ask if they feel like they're gonna hurt someone.
I think you really get off on selling yourself.
see if the guy you're into will make that extra effort.
you shouldn't take that to mean that you both are incapable of feeling for each other.
If they really don't know about you at all, then how would they know this?
who cares what people think
If you could have 4 qualities in your chick, what would they be?
Chicks like guys with brains.
I feel joy, weird, and odd.
keep cool, you might try being a little hard to get
look the way she walks

I'll probably go check it out.
Don't wait, finish what you started.
There are way more men into bigger women than you think, lady.
Honestly, I said it casually, and I didn't expect him to remember.
Girls aren't into guys who all into themselves.
Look around.
CDs, DVDs, depends on the device.
You are both hard working to do it well.
If she likes you, she will call.
You are on my mind all the time and I like you so much.

We really weren't spend that much time together.
Didn't you release at least a thousand?
Seems like my friends just want to kiss and kiss.
Happy Bday dude
women think with their nugget
say something nice then ask her name, don't get freaky keep it cool
how long does it take before you realize you've wasted your time and she's not into it?

i'm my sister's only maid of honor and i demand it be perfect
I have trouble sleeping cause my bf snores like a pig!
It doesn't matter what they think. If they don't hit it off, they should stay apart.
You have a better chance of having her forever if ya don't tell her you want her forever.
Tell her if it's only to shoot the breeze, not to call so often!
I gotta stop now before I pee my pants!
You could be out of my thoughts in about three days.

Only certain girls are good enough cuz men think they are special.
I need to get laie sometimes.

Go with it if you feel comfortable and like it some.
Don't forget, til death do you part.
Just ask for her number, there's nothing wrong with that.
If girls think flowers die, then why do they want them so much?
To focus on her looks is shallow.

You certainly have set up a classic double standard.

If you wanna be friends, u probably want 2b more than friends
You gotta stop keeping secrets cuz its hurts the ones you love.
Be real & have some balls cuz that's what woman want, but be real more.
Why do ya care a/b what others say?
A dude that says that isn't being all that honest with himself, imho.
Ditch him & go out with his bro!

cougars like young men so they can feel betta!
I aint the typa chick that like romantic mealz at home
I'm just doing this so I can get more points.
Thats just something you are going to have to risk.
Don't let him keep you stuck at home because you want to work on your love life.
Don't tell him too quick, no matter what.
It's so dumb to date someone that u work with.
If you both like going to the movies together, then do it.
It's right before fiveplay and just after threeplay.
Get a sex toy that you could both have fun with.
ego ... its a guy thing lol

probs not.. until he finds another GF.
you gotta get back in the game!

Chat on email and phone to keep internet dating safe.
Yeah I did that and it was fun.
Cheap ideas are everywhere. Find which one works best for you.
You're probably done looking over the men that sees the world in you.
You'll find the right one.
you know it's real love if you can fart when you're around each other.
hope you get the chance to check it out sometime soon.
just walk up to her and say hey.
well i dunno your age (that would help!)
yeah, it is not healthy to do
there is NO ROOM for crazy monsters like him in society!!
do you mean seems more sexual?
this is question unfair?
That's like saying, "What can they say after the fact?"
You can save money by choosing certain dates.
I have no further comments on the issue.
Why do guys have a hard time saying "love?"
if she loves you she should be fine with it
he asked if i can come with you
a lot of guys just want sex
Its bc of a back spasm.
Guys need to take r last names.
Don't lose your friends bc of some stupid guy.
If he's into u, you'll just know
So glad they r up to the challenge.
Put her favorite songs on cd.
I just want to be happy.
dont try to fuck
i feel embarassed when i fall in love
wait for u to be ready
u are too special for them
so, should I take it that he's into me?
I think a guy should take the first step in the dating game.
if I had my way, I would have kept my maiden name.
cut that negativity out of your life and don't look back.
Try checking on how he's doing.
Try new things to meet new peeps.
It's BS that my cousin likes her cuz I still got feelings.
It worked, I'm convinced.
do hugging, gifts, and fun for Vday
not for any other thing but looks
they had no chance
i think they both are interested in me
itty bitty women is hwat they like.
remember to choose and vote for the best.
Hubby and I have been together 4 years and just got maried in december 2005.

she is strong and loving, but not happy
Yuh are young if yuh are interested in sixth graders
Size, shape, looks, and othuh surface features should not mattuh at all
Yuh are askin' what deir stance is about gay relashunships, or what?
I agree, kiss him, and he will have a response fawh yuh
He gave me his cellphone so I could put my numbuh in it
if you want to have some fun here, I would suggest scoping out the clubs, restaurants, or gyms.
based on that, I would say that that they work it out, but not often, so hope I managed to help.
If you're ever down in FL, hit me up!
Just go ask her if she wants to go on a date with you.
sorry, but idk. I still wish you the best.
Hi I really want to visit your country
Look for another sexy chick and she will become jealous
girl please don't even ask that question unless you want to get mad.
She knew I like him so I don't know now
He's always poppin his eys,why?
Try 4play to slow the roll
Black hair makes fair skin gals look pale

He is out playing while you've been gone.
Who wouldn't say yes?
not everyone can be themselves together
men don't do no better

Youve found your true love and you need to be with them
You dont need to prove3 it if hes worht it
youre too young to talk about kissing
Well all you gotta do is order 1 online an uh the stork it's all magical its gon brang you 1.
It's so much harder as time passes up.
All you gotta do is do you an find somebody else!
How old is they?
all you need to do now is smile!!! :) :)
bottom line is that you gotta stop talking to him and thinking about him
girls that whine about not having flowers are just ungrateful.
i'm laughin cuz that's why i'm single!!
females that are pretty or have good personality
I hate girls.
You should refuse to ever see your cousin or boyfriend.
I don't remember ever giving a girl a Christmas present unless I like her.
Who can tell if Euro women feel more hot sexually?
I was at a carnival when I met mine.
I have no doubt that my husband likes me for who I am.
I know her, she doesn't lie.
If they don't make up their minds soon, we start moving.
