And so what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
Good luck in your search for the one!
WHY DOES EVERYONE SEEM TO WANT SOMEONE THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE AND KNOW THAT THEY SHOULDN'T WANT.
Do you like to argue and fight???
So if you're set on that, that's the way to go!!
My ex of 3 years cheated.
Work at it but don't let him keep you locked up at home.
>>Other than those two things, just ask him once in a while.
Also men get bored and tire way before woman do.
She's strong and loving and most of all...really wasn't as happy as she thought she was.
its one way of saying i don't like you!
King had a song about this - Only your Mother loves you (and see might be jiving too).
He loves you, too, girl...Time will tell.
he wants me to change how i look.
I know I have someone to come home to.
did you fell goog because i want to have sex, but you have to be careful
you want all your friends forever?)
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE SLUTTY.
Going to a club and dancing.
Don't go anywhere you went with him or her.
They're a lot of fun - there's plenty to do.
it all depends on when ur ready.
Stay 100 miles away from this guy.
Just be prepared cause if it happen once it can happen again!
I'm just looking for the girl who wants that time with me
Least not till he gets another girlfriend.
Wife says, We don't wear that shit.
if you're asking, then you should break-up w/ and open yourself to other options.
why do gays want to get married?
(saying sorry to him without commiting a mistake is humilation to ur self...AND DON'T EVER GET WEAK!!)
do you have to rush your choice?
THEY BOTH DONT RESPECT YOUR FEELING.
No seriously, think about howmany cocky girls are out there.
She is too afraid to ask him out.
get a grip, how can you love someone that you don't even communicate with.
i'd ask you out, but i live in Oregon and have no idea where you live...
they have never proformed before and it doubles the plesure!
i'll probably go and see one.
Either way, best of luck but I'm just glad that I have brown hair!!
Mail me a pick honorarius@yahoo.com and I will tell you...
it is absolutely just a challenge!!!!!!!!!!!
well-im  girl so ill help u out.
Dont tell them but let them find out once your in bed with her.
if i would've kept my last name its just a freakin name.
i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
he's telling that to some gurls too... he's a womanizer..
DROP HIS BUTTT, THERE ARE PLENTY OF FISH IN THE SEA OF AMORE:0)
I know because I am just like your wife.
when she calls, text her back
No way im 5`4 and he`s 6`2
Dont you know the number one rule, Trust No One.
we've tried breakin up a couple times but it never happens.
Oh and some because theyre thin and skinny and nowadays anorexic girls are a turn on.
if u have penis than its no problem u just hv to  penitrate her pussy with ur errect penis.
in that case tkake some defense classes.
I just got out of a 3 yr relationship with my baby's father.
what happened when the politician took viagra?
Hi, my name is xxxxxx  Been working for me for years.
i can onli say...women r complicated...
We like soft approch and a lil bit of chasing.
you would be genuinly suprised in the type of people that go to them.
it is very fun and enjoyable especially when you meet each other after texting a few months
Hey, I'm in NYC I'll help you out if your around!
Sounds strange but it worked in about 3-5 days for me!
Don't worry, I aint working with much either.
why does it matter what they think if they dont get along dont spend time togather.
if he is then you have a good man.
If He Likes You, You'll Know!
i guess its normal, but id just move on
The rest is easy from there!!
I like any guy that is funny.
Girl only you can decide on this...
Why do you ask this question??????????????
do go telling everyone just because you think thats right.
10 years gap is just nice.
Then if he still doesn't like you, then move on.
ok i see him ever week in psr but i just cant talk to him!!!
Beacuse they feel insecure with less educated guys..........
For one thing if it doesn't work out there goes your job.
And I hope to God it doesn't ever pass!
Only the ones that aren't worth your time
smaller of course, and it is all about LOOKS!!
You guys don't have any reason to hate each other.
If you don't you'll always wonder.
Some people choose not to because of thier religion, others don't.
give it a chance because if you break up with them it would be harder to be friends
The Best of Luck to ya!
Men who were not ready to committ.
this is a big day in both of your lives, it shouldnt be done quickly and without thought.
i'm 55 years old and still live at home with my mammy,whats wrong with that!!!!
one man willing to move 21 hours/1,400 miles just to be with me.
I must not be ugly enough then
but thats ok. im a GIVER.WINK, WINK.
well depend on women wot she want
REMEMBER IT TAKES TWO NOT ONE
if he really didn't like her and did like you, then he would have already dumped her for you.
hang around untill the bar closes -- or visit a prison
PLEASE DONT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE !!
Because believe it or not, women hate cocky men.
But stick with wats inside of u.
Hell, it happened to me twice.
Maybe your young, I don't know.
No matter what he says, Action speaks louder then words
aint nothing in the world like a big boned gurl!
( even if he  is rich, dont sell ur self.
just moved to Sacramento, Gay male, 30
the people who are around you now, like your friends, should like you no matter what!
cuz they like the little titis and pussys
Wait til you get older and if you both STILL feel the same way then go for it!
yes im not one of those people but i know there are lots of them
No, not if you have to ask...
and you want to suck another man's D**K???
coz they are girls man and they are not as sofisticated as we are !
'...does this mean he likes me?.
Dont worry about him n just sonsentrate in school so you can lern n then woory bout yer b/f
I dated one and I know.
look at the way she walks.
No (at least I hope not).
hello: i am looking to visit your country.
Overtime should I give him another chance?
The same guy you wanna be in a relationship with?
i went and there he was.
(that's what i called it).. but , why?
that way you can still go by your last name!
both of u work hard to get it right!!
i have told her i liked her and she said she would want to ruin or friendship.
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat
show her your naked baby pictures.
Is very important to last at least 30-45 minutes!!!
but I am not telling you to be celibate till then ;-)
If he if flurting with her ok jump him .
I love curly hair I like to run my fingers thru it
I want my wife to GROW too.
Well that is just the way it is I guess.
One girl Michelle, who probably wouldn't mind being named, spoke up and said she didn't believe in it.
I can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash........LOL
but he was a lil busy after that.
I do not know what to do because she knows how much I care about him.
If you do eat something like that then just quit.
it could be that u need to piss or the last dream u had
You know.......if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask.......sheesh!
If you were friends before and have stronger feelings now then it should be O>K>
and i want to try again.
figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers.
Lie lie lie and then Lie some more
Wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there!
If you two are at a dance, he shouldn't really care.
Trust him,  don't bring it up again.
honestly, most girls are just Waiting for the guy to Tell her how he truly feels.
HELL YA I WOULD LOVE TO MEET THE LADYS!!
I actually ponder this one now and again.
i met this guy once, very romantic, i met him in this huge rainstorm.
ok now some guy's like girls like that and some don't
it comes right after threeplay and before fiveplay.
When I fall in love, I feel stupid.
If you have to ask, then you are not in love.
If you start to feel the it comming on then start the four play again.
i don't understand someone please give me the answer
i saved a good $500-600 doing my own flowers and it was no hassle at all.
I JUST GOT A  DIVORCE AND SO DO DID HE.
But ask a girl about the sympthoms because i'm a boy.
Be you show a little toghness thats what girls like atleast most of them but mostly be yourself
follow ur heart... it's neva wrong
They bother U all day long.
See if he calls, e-mails or even cares.
you can do a civilian arrest  answ3r3r
a spasm in your back usually
by now, you might love your wife for everything you guys have endured.
GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE EVERYTHING GOES WELL!
say i love you and if the wait to say it back it tells it all
Try asking her out again and see what she says.
;)  There is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
Ask her questions (don't just talk).
When you first fall in love, your gitty, goofy, and silly happy just thinking about that person.
And remember there is more then 1!
i think they just look better than a whole lot of nations out there.
We got married all over again!
All in all I don't think it really matters.
And Im sure as heck not driving 5 hrs just to hang out unless I really really like her.
how often can you have sex with pam anderson?
I told her that I loved her and truly meant it.
think about what good it brought about.
the thing is im a person that does not like to brake others heart.
give a rose and express ur love
I LIKE THICK BECAUSE I FEEL CHEATED WITH A THIN ONE!
Remember, TILL DEATH DO YOU PART!!
Bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
what the hell r ya talking abt?
IF YOU KEEP TALKING TO HIM FOR ANOTHER WEEK,HE MIGHT THINK HE IS MARRIED TO YOU.
women dont want much, just some acknowldgement and sometimes help.
At least thats what it seems like to me.
Don't be afraid to say no.
dump him...there are always more fish in the sea.
TO ME IT REALY DOSE'NT  MATTER, BUT A HAND FULL IS QUITE ENOUGHT FOR ME.
choose the one that adores you the most!
you still released at least a thousand!
You go to a bar and get drunk!
give it some time and thought.
no u shouldnt leave them...just teach them what to do to please u better...
bembie hit the nail on the head
no.u guys kiss when ur ready
haha julesac is funny, but mean.
If youre asking this, u surely have already distanced yourself from her and yet remaining a friend.
DONT FORGET TO CHOOSE AND VOTE FOR BEST ANSWER!!!
Dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is.
I dont know.But i know of another website that i go to..
OK IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOUR STARTING TO HAVE FEELINGS FOR THIS BOY!
!he must be a control freak
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE GIRL OR THE AND HOW INTERSTED THE GIRL IS IN THE GUY.
look, try and get out to meet people.
usually it is multiple things not just one thing
if u really really really really really really like them
For the guys: (A) Do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman?
If all you do is argue it's not worth it..
What makes it worse is that I already went out with him for four years!!!!
u just have to be patient and the right girl will come along.
unless you dont love your husband anymore and you have room for another man????
wife because then you can do more with out comminting a sin
She definitely wants you to think she's good looking, but she doesn't want that to be reason #1.
Depends, some days I want to have sex, somedays I don't.
plus they are more passionate in love makin.
If you play w/both at the same time, she will probably f-*# the sh%$ out of you!
Because he wouldn't work, hit me, used guilt trips, was a big mama's boy, etc.
maybe because your the most beautiful girl they have seen.
it really depends if someone is vain or not.
someone i can be myself with.
Send me your picture and contact me ..
Stay away from this guy friend.
the doctor can't even believe it.
yes for sure, especially when she throw up!!
If not, then don't sweat it!
i could give you some pointers.
If you feel your love is fading, don't just sit there and do nothing!
I will not stay with someone I don't trust.
i only once told a girl that i loved her, and i meant it.
You married him and it was for a reason.
Rip off your shirt and do a Tarzan yell.
Yes, girl down there, don't have sex.
they accept this in thier culture.
Always trail ride with a friend.
you didn't give us very good information/  do you all live in one house.
Move on - so what if he's hot...looks aren't everything.
lol  most important... just be yourself.
yes be disappointed and be mad!!
Sorry, I never have felt that way!
i sure wont like any girl who would make my life difficult...
Or if he gets them first, you get the popcorn.
practice, ask if your doing good.
but if u are sure then first tell your parents if you havent done allready.
well i met mine in a carnival.
Sounds like a rhetorical question :)
WELL I BELIEVE EVERYBODY SHOULD KEEP THEIR OWN NAME.
but ur first kiss should feel like ur in hevan.
There is nothing but trouble there!
How to make a woman happy  To make a woman happy....?
dont do things tht can get you hurt.
i mean of course you will be making more money if you work hard.
Please don't go up to her and tell her how good she looks.
I don't think it's good idea, u are not there for this purpose!
go up to her and say 'hi, are you single?'
i think he would make a great valentine.
Just be prepared to let her go.
rather than just sit there and wait till u are a good one.
Just tell them, what are they gonna do, slap you??
Get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
Well if u really like this guy smile and make nice talk with him.
take them both out at the same time
it happened to me and i am now dating that person
only two points to make friends  1.
so you might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you..
Preferrably someone who doesn't hate you.
We tried to move on but it didn't work.
WHEN WILL PEOPLE IN THIS EFFED UP WORLD FINALLY REALIZE THIS?!?!?!?!?!?!
I wouldn't bother calling him back.
Try not to hang out with him and find another guy.
look for another hot girl, so she will be jealous.
so in my opinon ur not a hoe!
Red= love, black = death ect...
if she likes him than she dont like u dump her is not his fault that she strays
for me anything after 3 days and i might start to forget about you.
find a girl who has talets she also must be prety
There no one you can trust more than a good friend !
start the day off with breakfast out...then perhaps a nice walk.
Then go pick them up (If she say yes).
If yes, why do I heard some girl said flowers ar not going to last?
may be its interesting for them
could it ever be the same...
it's not that bad... at least it is not Bella
Could it be because some men are liars and fat mouths??
Or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances...
FINALLY A CULTURE THAT HAS IT RIGHT.
my twin wont talk or listen to me
want to get something you can not get rid of go ahead then
Only I am not thinking about him but I am having dreams about him.
if ur talkin ten then i think it would be fine to get a video/ computer game.
Go for it and take the chance!!!
If he CAN'T then take him to a place where they have slowdances (dinner date, maybe?)
i feel this is most beautiful in a family life.
IT'S YOUR CHOICE NOT TO  HATE ONE,  I DISLIKE THEM TO SAY THE LEAST.
NEVER ever get married without a Prenup....
Get a life and don't waste mine.
She says your too good for her?
Guys come & go, but friends are forever!
it could probably mean a lot of things.
yes it is normal cause their is lots of people who still likes some they broke up with.
I`d like to see what a black female has to say about this.
guys are stupid!who knows why they do what they do.
well if they gave you their phone number you dont have to wait at all
cause were masters of the universe...
I'm in love and don't care who knows it Buddy the Elf.
And whatever you do, don't try to have both of them at once.
if you really wanted to be with him, you wouldn't be asking.
Remember being friends with someone online is ok but there are limits.
when my sis kisses someone she closes her eyes to get ready.
Now me, I wouldn't marry any women who didn't want to change her name, but that is just me.
Umm small party for the family
girls are perverts they just hide it and act like it around other girls secretly
and im only in  fith grade o ya!
But you do what you want.
Don't do that, it won't work.
If they don't, it's time to move on.
He everything I ever wanted with the looks, money, stuff.
Yes, and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding.
Nope, she is not a liar.
SHUT THE HELL UP AND BE GAY IF YOU WANT TO!!!
and he had his nose pierced.
yup, i can lift him, he's only 185....lol
you need a therapist for that.
Maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
You should go see a shrink!
Giving you stupid excuses of the wall!Acting the way he didn't before!
Be strong, and hang in there.
Nope, he's too darned big and I'm too darned weak!
Basically if she is so drunk that she becomes a slob / or slut then yes it is unattractive...
Exchange letters, e-mails, chat online, talk over the phone, send packages...  Just keep in touch!
Especially if you don't feel like it.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
Giving it up just for him to stick around is like selling your soul to the devil.
I cant give you a wife view but hopefully mine is just as good.
plus it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone...
Depends on the woman, it's better shaved=-)
ask in english terms...cannot understand you
hey, I'm a guy, but i'll tell you a little.
i like him alot and i want to win him over not push him away.
Ok Like I really really really like this guy and I dont know if he likes me back.
btw - ur avatar looks familiar.
It's been over 6 months & I can't seem to get over it.
maybe he thinks he will  be turned down.just ask...i would.
You gotta think about that and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him!
A picture the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated....thats special
i am in college and he is my only sourse of income until i get out.
listen it aint that easy.I got with my ex-boyfriend in 2nd grade,then again in 4th,and again in 8th.
i've been with this girl for 8 months and we haven't kissed is this bad?
Some guys don't like boobs at all!
or that she just wants to see other people?
And hes seen me every day for about 4 or 5 years!
there was his stop so he got off the train.
I mean the worst -the absolute worst - is that she says no.TAKE A CHANCE & GOOD LUCK!
But, I know exactly what I want in a relationship.
i would flirt and send flowers and candies to my self and then he would ask u out sometime
I also hate seeing my dad unhappy.
I feel bad because I know that I snore sometime -- most people do, right?
i like sos and need to know if im in love
If you guys TRUELY love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc.
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits
However that does not mean that big girls can't be cute.
But he is getting married this month.
But those guys are jerks and you don't want them anwyay.
SAY WILL U GO OUT WITH ME!!!!!!!!
and get married only after you've been with a guy for more than 2 years.
Man has penis and woman has clitoris.
SEPERATE THE BAD THING AND MOVE ON!
(It would be easier to do if I were mad, though!!
If she will tell the administration i will be expelled coz its pakistan not america
you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will.
Like I said; he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breathe and ask him.
Maybe you and I can get together sometime & we'll find love with one another.
I would be, but I'm just married !
Play the field a bit now.
As everyone said... dont get married so early.
just want to know HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE DOC YET !
Pay Attention to what the other person says!
Just Talk your spouse about this
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young.
i was thinking about a medium pink color, but with what??
Ask if they wanna go somewhere with you.
-a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum.
Or do guys really do prefer bigger women?
problem is i really like him.
so id say, they do work out, just not a lot of the times...hope this helps...
SHould I dump him because of his mother
I did this before (accidentally) and my friend was mad that I deleted him!
I dont think I mind either way.
but thats her way... you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open...
there are some that do, but you should be able to tel.
r u talking about ur avatar?
I dont ever remember giving a girl a Cristmas gift unless I liked her.
I don't know what to do.
Try to be your self and don't show off
so just take it day by day-step by step.think of how he lost a good thing.
Dang it, if only every man knew What Women Want the world would be a much happier place!!!
compliments, honesty and make it about her.
i think hse will crash him!
IT JUST MEANS THAT SHE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE GUY.
please do.. im thinking  you would get slapped mid-reach,or kicked in the groin.
Only now she and I are both divorced.
if he/she want to see you picture rightaway it sex!
hey it's better than her givin u a fake # to call lol!
tell her to move to MASS.............
if you feel this strongly about it then maybe you shouldn't get married.
The pictures I've seen...I would say Maui or the Bahamas.
the guy i like is mad at me.
You're 13 don't even worry about it...
That way you dont have to worry about you calling him too much!
I am a guy and let me tell you, we love to chase!
Thanks for the pep in advance!
we always seem to push the ones taht we love away.
they think that they can control other peoples lives when thye cant
thats weird but maybe idk ill talk to my friend by his locker.
I don't know....how would you like something crammed up your butt!!
If a guy cares he calls.
what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday?
he probably doesnt want to either.
hold her hands, look to her eyes and say it, but only say it if you really love her.
Some guys do...and some guys don't.
hey i really want to know so please help me out!!
The timing just wasnt right for it with the old guy...you'll see!
Generally kind and my fifth: I'll just be dissapointed if she's stupid.
its one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
I do not believe trust has to be earned, because how is that even possible.
lol so if thats u u deff need to stop that is FONKY!!
DON'T LET HER RULE YOUR LIFE, SHE WILL JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH IT.
I have yahoo email and that works for me.
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
Oh yes, the trick ass hoe's never had a chance.
when you can fart in front of the one your dating
depends on how old they are.
And any guy who sas he woul is prolly not being entirely honest with himself.
If you flirt with him, the challange is not there.
If you need your x emotionally - then ya got some troubles.
20 to 32...she doesn't have to be younger than you.
my be she don't love  you but  try to use your  brean not  your haerd
If you want your girlfriend forever..........then just don't let her know that you want her forever, simple.
There are tons of cheap ideas out there, just find what you like and work with it!
And if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - DONT.
find a nother girl and if that dosent work move back
Most often (not always) that will be guys around your age, give ot take.
if u you act like dat all da time she might think u desperate.
not everyone on here is in school.
tell him what you really want...that's what they tell me but never got to do...speak up...
should i  make the first move or should i wait for him to make the first move ?
What a typical double standard you have set up!!
after a while you dont even see the color.
:) I haven't tried it yet, but I am still trying to get up the nerve....
If you two are serious then asking her that question shouldn't bother her.
sak her out what's up with that?
How about...Would you like to go out with me sometime?
yah look me up if you are ever in florida  lol!!!
Those was good times I tells ya.
its all about her, and no it shouldnt be something that happends on a first date.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time.
If he comes to his senses then great if not SCREW HIM!!
you are too good for them
Jump him because she likes him??
depending on the age, cds or dvds.
20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THAT IS ALL YOU CAN BE SO START FROM THE BEGINNING
ill like to visit usa what are the needfull things
anyone with any ideas, tips or general info, email me back!!!
u sound like a very lovely person so dont let some of these gals drag you down.
you dont look, just go out and enjoy yourself and have fun and a gf will come along.
Don't persue it, he is getting married.
like clear liquid and turns yellow when dry?
i mean if in your country there is an short messaging system in your cellphone then find a textmate!!
Then when she starts closing her eyes , kiss her in the lipps and then its up to you!
please be honest with me i can handle the truth
Have fun, and remember to never get so comfortable that you always know what's going to happen next!
Its Shows how much they care about you!
Tell her that you miss her and that you love her.
Coffee, lunch, site seeing, walk/talk/play in the park, museum, movie matinee
WHAT YOU  WHANT IS A HOOKER, YOU CAN FIND THAT IN ANY CORNER OF THE WORLD.
but now we do all these things together and i dont know what to do..
Because if it fails you be up $h*T!
and its been the best thing for at least me.
Try using some of these, but only if they actually apply!!!
THE PROBLEM IS THAT HE CHEATED ON ME RECENTLY AND IT WAS THE WORST THAT HE COULD OF DONE.
if you are happy she should be happy, unless he really is being bad to you.
We like it when guys do things for us and think about us.
maybe if you give him space he will eventually call you back.
Tell him you don't want a real relationship.
if you look creepy and you look..they'll all think you're leering.
I don't know about love,but he likes you for sure
if a guy really respects u then he'll understand.
ask yourself and decide.and if you can afford it, do if you want to.
because he is a superhero that is the closest to being just a regular guy.
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the the good outweighs the bad
I dont think it is wise to date at work.
STUPID U NEED A THEORY CLASS 4 THAT!!!!!!!
let it take it's course from there.
about what they think about gay marrige/ relationshiops?
so ofcourse i had to ask him if he was blowin me off.
guys will think youre hot no matter what with this usually.
but i dont htink that by not having sex with him he will become unfaithful or leave you.
The safest rules of internet dating are these: 1. chat via email and messenger 2. chat on the phone.
marriage is really about trusting & communicating
Ok, so I had this problem too.
depending on what you kissed ;)
it depends on if you could trust him before!
make sure you dont make her hate you just get your point across too her
Uh- wher've U been meeting these Filipinas?
Imgaine if it was JUST considered love??
That way, you aren't exactly telling them what you specifically don't like about them.
If he is, then go for it!
Then see if shes open for a dinner & a movie.
hey im sorry i don't know and i wish best of luck to both of you!
HOWEVER----i find him looking at me every now and then.
this is sin, our selves have started this
Fun includes eating meals (not breakfast if yo know what I mean).
MAKE A KIND MOVE , IF NO RESPONCE U KNOW WHAT TO DO !
let him make the first move if u do it may make u look like ur ubsesd with him!
You people have no right to get married!
My tragic love story was I loved him very much and he loved me too.
u seem desperate and you'll never find a      if you're desperate.
But he swears that we're just friends.
looks don't really matter unless you are trying to prove something.
again, i know once u have sex with him, he is no longer a good friend.
the fact that a guy is sooo self centered is a huge turn off for me.
DON'T RUSH IT FEEL ALL YOUR EMOTIONS COME ALIVE.
it a two way traffic until you get them you will know which one it is
So you have ONE baby out of wedlock.
I know i'm overtly picky about people HOW CAN I STOP IT!
it hurts....alot...maybe some girls might say that's it?
im going to jump that boy is that the right choice
SO it was a good ideea!
if she gets drunk then it is not a turn off.
Because some women send men tiny messages with out saying it clearly.
I'd perfer if they left me alone...  sorry, i got off-topic.
ask her to go do something she is interested in or to see a movie she'd like.
You are a man <--- Term used lightly!!
Haha...  Too bad it's not automatic like MSN or AOL.
and thats how they'll react to it so yea its bad situation for you and him.
go back to that person at once before it becomes too late for you.
lol I too want to smack that smile off her face
and ask if he wants to dance with you.
then she might say that looks ugly i think (a color) looks better.
ask him to go see a doc.
I never went out with him a second time.
First of all, why did u guys break up?
why wait,,,,, go ahead do it
as long as he dosent mind , who elses opinion matters?
i think im still totally in love w/ him...
I never wanted to have sex again.
The main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you.
if u have to ask other people i really dont think ur ready to
Im a gilr, i say those things....
a big savings area is flowers.
time wiil tell give it six months and see what happens.
either that or you are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from
well from your list, i would have to choose spiderman.
i was cheated on for 3 of the years.
all seniors think freshman girls are easy, its sad but true
and if he says yes than you can tell him.
and impress her with affection and love.
And if you have, what was it like?
Celebrate Valentine with joy and fun...give eachother gifts and hav a fun...
any women beside the ugly guys will look hot...
So, when I moved in my neighbor asked me out.
you should probaly make a move because he is obviosly shy
just on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
be yourself say whats up and you might get a response
there are many times that you love the guy but not sure did he love you also.
if your talkin hubby or the like i'd say tools toys for his vehicle, sports related things.
That got me really hot, but I ran off.
Me, I'll pick up the tab if, I can get your vote for best answer.
k. So what size of breast does the average guy like do you think?
many women 22 are dating men 27 so the 22 yo men feel insecure and have to fish downstream
Lust less like...you just go out?
they probobly know you cant really hide that but you should tell your parents
I will make u princess in planet Kripton !!
My last girlfriend's Bf did that to her (before we met), and she still kept him.
my friend has a bf who she talks 2 online and on the phone.
do you like fake nails or manicured ones?
Tell her, girls like to her the truth GOOD LUCK
we can restle around and be the best of friends.
Stay true to your husband...after all, he's the one you said I do to...
DONT LISTEN TO THESE FOOLS WITH AL THEIR B.S.
yeah, im a guy so i dont really have to pay.
Remember, NO BIRD EVER FLEW ON ONE WING!!
just let her know what you feel.
it depends, if you really love him you will prob think youll want to egnolage it
If you or the other person is married, RUN!!!!
No men don't but little boys do
Help me win this debate with her !
My girlfriend's the nuttiest, but I love her anyway.
simple enough, do like anyone else does.....play with it.
sweetheart let him go ,if he is ment to be with u he will come back to you
Of course after 3 day of that my back went out LOL.
stay alive and get your old life back.
So thats why I ask why dont guyz ever know what they want with any kinda relationship!?!?!
Maybe ask him out to lunch or a movie or somthing.
Girls don't like guys who is all about themselves.
it depends do u like either one???
I was always looking and I kept picking jerks.
so, no i feel its a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them.
Some do,some don't have it in them.
Just do what makes you happy!
because for some reason i cannot
So it would have to be love.
because....you know.......try to search you love.....but becareful.....!!!!!!
don't ask her to perform some act for you, make her the spotlight.
girls are simply impressed if u can show a little care, respect and honesty to them.
Tell the bastard to GET OUT.
they think it is the only right way!
Good luck and keep it cool!
That said u need to figure out youself if u want to stay married to him.
And I hate him for it.
Men like this, typically become wife beaters if you don't OBEY them!
First off, I have 4 kids....so a homemaker is more work than my job even.
no i haven't..i prefer normal-looking guys
it defenetely looks like he has feelings for u.do u show how u feel;;u should!!
everything seems so open and hit and run with most people these days.
i have a problem of unloading all my junk up front and maybe i told this guy to much.
the right date can save money on lots of things.
If you truly love your man & want to work it out then tell your X to respect that.
That only makes her easier to bed.
Don't think you should try it!
simple...honesty and love and try to true with them
i hoping for at least a 90% but realistically i think its more like 70% or 65%.
but cuddling up with a large women is one of the best feelings i know of.
And women also expect guys to act like that, so why should they grow up?
A couple of ways: -  Get him drunk.
The problem is not if u ask her while at work or not.
Stick with the 13 & 14 year old boys .. they are easier to control anyway.. LOL Good luck
YOU NEVER LET A MAN  MISTREAT YOU
PS Im not a stay at home romantic dinner type of girl.
!,anyway when i left him i swore i,d never get married again!!
pickup lines are tacky..just be yourself and complament her alot..women like that
You'll be fine just have fun!
not all the time, sometimes men shave them, it depends on the woman,
i love him but i think im ready to move oe, meet new guys!
so wait for another 4 years.
I hope I see some of it soon.
I don't want to be mean.
also u shood wait a while b for having kids.
i would like to have some fun with u that's why i answered this stupid question
try to contact their q&a team..they'll help you through..have a nice day!
Because womens don`t put out often...
if he insists, it means he only after sex.
B) Looks definitely matter, anyone saying they don't is probably lying.
Whle MAKING LOVE is like living a fantasy.
when you 18 or 20 because when they said something they dont mean it
when possible, try to make it yourself.
But (there's always a but isn't there?
If she is not into you anymore...
i seriously doubt that you are in love with that many guys.
on average id say about 45% at first but than one you get to knowthe person maybe 15%
Play sports with your guy friends.
She will tell you if it's not OK.
I don't mean, do you think women are sexy and beautiful.
how do i get he to stop nagging me and leave me alone.
a sex toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
men without hair look like little boys to me, and it's not sexy at all.
i agree, just kiss him... he'll respond one way or another.
a good way is to imagine yourself without him/her.
here in America it is not so important...
well if it was before you then he wasnt cheating at all... obviously.
man how many times I passed up a great oppertunity by worrying about someone saying No......
Because the white women are taking up all the men!!
ur self image is also very important.
Have you ever had a PAP smear.
good god how old are you ?
but i think they both like me.
Okay well first thing it sounds as if YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY MARRIED!.
yes jaime is going to ask rubi out.... but it is not yoru business...
that is a sign, things like that can make it really obvious
u should take the time to get to know both of them equally without goin out with them.
i'd love to hear logical opinons on this, thanks
If you like the guy then go for it.
Having FUN with guy friends is OK.  1.
So its natural with that guy.
women take on alot and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
no, because i'm not married yet
let me know what you think, thanks
If you are gay BE GAY!!!
good luck and hang in there.
i like older girls so i think this is sick and wrong that they cant go out with her
i am just curious to what everyone thinks.
my last bf i met driving round a roundabout in another car!!
becuz if you do then your gonna lose your friend over a guy!!!!
It really was a casual aside when I said it -- I didn't think he would remember.
are you a country girl or a city girl.
hang out all day together and to top it off touch his feet.
im very bored bein single.sittin back watchin other gurlz hava all da fun!
)women are curious about sex with other women, even me!
I don't know what you said because I was to lazy to read your typing.
i hate it my self, i love the straight ones
This is Doc Izzy and I love and adore bigger women!
there are not any words that are going to make it any better.
do it before it is to late
well to tell u tha truth u learn but u have to actually do it.
Nay Pier is a great place or one of the museums....there r alot of great resteraunts of hotels.
thats a stereotype( not a country girl by the way)And I think Im sexy in my own way.
he wont turn you down .
well i hope you read this really well.
lots of men like thick girls, most of them are black.
If she's interested she'll call later.
No, you won't because you know he has cheating tendancies.
Ask ur self that, if you know what I mean.
I find if I try real hard I can see things I know aren't there normally there.
Lets get coffee and chat and take it from there!
just move on with your life and frind some one eles!
ILL BET YOUR NOT, BUT TRY TO EMAIL ME ATILIKETHICKCHIX@YAHOO.COM AND I WILL BE HONEST.
Me and this boy been going off and on since last year.
I really care about you and I can't stop thinking about you.
is worth  the wait when you are ready.
if you don't know ask someone who would.
keep away ur fear and tell him.
thats a chance your gonna have to take.
So if you want to be attractive to losers, creeps, and pervs Drink up!
not for anything but lookin at
After i while i t passes and i still love him
IT'S YOUR OWN LIFE, AS YOU SAID.
(and now even in devorce im stuck with it !
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend doesnt mean he is.
sure let me know more 'bout you
when one minute you want to throttle the other person & the next you want to jump their bones
the girlz that are pretty or have a great personality.
Ppl whose parents well take care of them, big time lazy ppl.
i do not know what she wants.
it is very complcated tell it again please but in simple
Show her what you're good at.
if u can imagine him as the father of ur children !
If you dont ask sombody else might.
Haha thats why I am single!
if you really love him, you would let him go...
if she doesnt want to be with you- try to be her friend.
well if he says he isnt believe him.
Lets get it out of limbo ;)
I even worked there for awhile and met the man of my dreams.
I'VE BEEN WITH MY HUSBAND FOR 4 YEARS WE RECENTLY GOT MARRIED IN DECEMBER OF 2005.
focus on how things are and what would be best for you right now.
u'll see that no matter how hurt u r it's still the simplest reason y u smile.
Wow I didn't think Pakistan is that conservative.
i have to stop right away because i'm ready to relieve myself.
WHATEVER YOU DO...DO NOT TELL HIM TOO SOON!!!
We can't answer if she really means it.
i dont like a guy dat does dat all da time.
then u can make an easier decision.
I have sexed many girls and some where whores.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
TALK 2 YOUR BEST FRIEND AND SEE IF ITS COOL
is this a trick question ?
I don't know can I do anything about it?
people are HUSBANDS and WIVES for REASONS!!!
if he doesn't then there are too many fish in the sea.
or just you wanna say that!?
If you aren't happy fix it or get out.
not all guys, but some guys do
I totally agree with Udaman...good luck girl
SOUND LIKE YOU LIKE TO SELL YOURSELF TO MUCH.
Your girlfriend will just think you're a jerk.
sometimes but you have to observe the one you call your man.
Replaying everything you ever did to me?
But don't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
I dated a guy this past year and he got to the a violent point.
Leave it alone-I don't care what she says, she's in enough pain.
how would anyone know if they don't know anything about you?
Just find one that loves you too.
it never hurts to be flirty!
we was hangin out a lil.
Don't use pick up lines , that's a turn off .
i love them b/c im a guy and i dont have to ask anyone to the dance
girl there are more guys out there that love thick girls than u think?
The girls that whine that flowers don't last are just ungrateful.
u need to be wit that person, you have found your true love
and i mean Really be her friend.
how do I get my sweetheart to show me he loves me
WELL BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO STOP TALKING TO HIM AND STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM
they never met but she says they're in love.
Don't do this over the phone, email, etc.
i'm not against gayz and lez's they are the best friends a person can have.
imet a girl and i want to know how to know if shes into me or not
Death is like a box full of candy corn
just try and make the best of what's to come.
Either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person.
She's the love of my life and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
because women think with their brains.
I'm still in love with my ex and I'm so mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
Only time will tell spend time with friends have fun don't thimk sbout it
Thats why I do not get in chat rooms anymore, unless its to laugh at all the freaks.
ohhh this is what i did - big bad mistake on my part.
I have no idea where to begin!!!
But he chaeted, so i guess I can lift or carry my husband.
if she is calling just to bablle then tell her to not call you so often!
thats all i have 2 say.
you shouldn't be asking this question?
i was also thinking about lime green.
I mean the both of you together.
I have a close girl friend.
Wanting to be something they're not?
well, if u can imagine ur self with him in bed @ night!!
they like the challange i know thats what i love about it
depends on the girl I guess... fair skinned females look extra pale when they have black hair.
Oh man i should do that when im dating next time!
Don't listen to what anyone else tells you to do.
I really like this guy, and I don't know if it's just a crush, or if I love him......
i think the Bomb is much easier!!
Not always the easiest but they have been pretty good years.
DONT FORGET TO CHOOSE AND VOTE FOR BEST ANSWER!!!
..... You tell her why you like her!
Did  turn gay or is it a curiosity thing?
No, Not if you have to ask.
the list could go on and on.
But he might enjoy all the waiting, dreaming & teasing.
Don't eat where you take a s***.
of course you do wanna chat hit me up fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com
When he teases you about the stupid little things.
if u think that he feels the same way about you, why not?
well, in my experience, a lot of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
They are often worse than men!!!
I've heard of friends getting married about 6 months after meeting somebody.
i don't know what u mean.
If you want kids, then homemaker.
what's the worst that could happen.
Intellect - a chick with brains is just sexy!
his/her intelligence,the way they carry themselves,good looks and activeness
sure...and will you pay mine too????
YES all i can say.. but yes, i have long black hair and im proud!!
I was NOT gonna let her win.
Chances r, if u like her as a friend, ull like her as more.
JUST BE YOURSELF WHEN YOU ARE WITH HER.
guys think that they are special, and that they are only good enough for certain girls.
find someone u like and say will u be my valentine!
Post more questions on Yahoo Answers!
Well,if the one boy picks on you, why like him?
Brokeback Mountain ,ok it's a guy but at least you'll be happy!
size, shape,looks, ect should NOT matter at all...
SEX IS NOT THE ONLY THING IMPORTANT IN LIFE DAMN IT!!!!!
you're probably just too good for him anyway.
you like him or you don't like him?
why dont you just ask her if you can kiss her?
Whos to say that country girls feel more sexy?
Well i dont no how old you are which would help.
Just think about what you like and do it back for them....kinda like a tounge massage.
Here's my answer: A) MOST guys definitely do not prefer girls that are skin and bone.
CUT YOUR COUSIN AN YOUR EX BOYFRIEND OFF COMPLETE.
or does his friends point at you when your with him.
YES IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO ENJOY GIVING PLEASURE RATHER THEN RECIEVING IT
Now I keep thinking of getting it on with a girl.
depends on if they are brunette or not
is she just trying to use you?
U can have a big u-no-what, n suck in bed.
get rid of the x if you are dating the guy you love right now.
It hurt like hell and I bled.
cuddling, kissing, fondling, playing with each others sex organs before sex.
when he does explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him back.
My bf loves me to death and doesnt want to give me up.
you are already doing it so why yet bother?
on the hood of my car at a waterfront in a light rain it was awesome!
I think you are probaly a nice guy and she probaly loves you alot.
your looking to hard, or maybe you're looking in the wrong places... sign up for yahoo personals
only if you want it to be.
But if she doesn't have a reason then she isn't ur friend!
you have to find whats right for you and your partner/s!
you are definitely not a hoe, don't worry.
GIRLS DON'T THINK IT'S COOL, THEY THINK IT'S GUYS WHO SMOKE ARE PATHETIC COS THEY ARE KILLING THEMSELVES
So - U like asian food?
they don't mean to get them pregnant they just can't keep it in there pants because they are PIGS!!!
I like natural / real girls, I don't like fake looking prissy drama queens.
)take on how the world works, and their desire to catch up
that's too many, and selfish ,indeed.... u just desperate n keep on trying another one right?
its like if you decide to eat chocalate and then moan cuz u look too fat.
Do you know he loves you?
my wife forgives me for alot of things .
FIRST YOU ORDER ONE ONLINE AND THE STORK BRINGS ONE TO YOU
i would say around 3 or 4
Imagine that i am that guy and be MY girl freind!
give them a chance to discover you.
its unusal yes, but nothing bad.
I still love him what to do
Don't just stay with him for the baby.
and never ignore her always listen to her...and when you do don't change the subjetct women hate that.
IT CAN BE GOOD LUCK ALSO IF YOU TAKE IT AS GOOD LUCK.
ITS a man thing live with it EGO
Sounds like u r going through a lot right now.
Good luck but DO YOUR HOMEWORK!
Don't come here, it smells like a trap to me.
Everywhere.... Just ask any girl passing by.... but ONLY IN THAILAND....  not in US .... lol
This gal does NOT want a bad boy at all.
But I need to be happy.
you are so full of it, teasing all these desperate lonely sad sad guys, shame on you
Also sometimes guys think they dont need you so bad until your gone.
only that i can say: good luck!
you married your hubby hopefully because you love him .
I LOVE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS TO  THE LADIES WITH POEMS,  HAS ANYBODY WRITTEN ONE FOR A SPECIAL SOMEONE.
Why tie yourself to just one guy?
That's if u both agreed on doing this.
It's like saying, What's got to stop me when I have already done it?
he just has to start over and earn your trust again.
One his side of his family I met his father.
we fall in love  they treat us bad  why are we there
i am one of those who want to wait until being totally in love with someone.
But try the nice way first..girls hate being ignored!
keeping secrets only hurt the ones you love.
Some women like big hairy guys, some guys like fat women, some gals like skinny guys, and vice-versa.
curves, esp if they have big boobs, and softness........can't beata soft woman
never tell her she's fat big one!!!
You are a MOM, Act like One!!!
OTHERS LIKE THINK DUE TO SOCIETY DICTATES ITS; I SAY SCREW SOCIETY AND GIVE ME THICK!
give them 2 months they will get over you.
Don't know, but daniel K has never read manga.
I guess it's kind of nice, it's like your dad's blessing all the way.
I like intelligent,fun and hot girls.
come to my town ill be your girl....
This generation is just too stupid.
Yeah, time to cash in your chips.
They are always in the 'in love' stage.
i see a malaysia air ad on tv and i go gaga.
it was really nice how he asked me out.
TRY TALKING TO HER AND ASK HER TO HANG OUT AS FRIENDS SEE IF IT GOES SOMEWHERE
(this is really hard because there are a lot of temptations out there).
Not what you can become just because she says too.
the two of you should talk privately and personally...you have to clear each other's side..do it now
Well, the one I liked goes like this.
Do not try to have sex.
just keep it cool, a little hard to get might help!
if your relationship survive the four seasons... i guess you should be ready....
I married my guy anyways and do you know why (besides love).
move on and find someone who doesn't hate you.
YOU CAN'T, so lets just start asumming it.
yes we like flowers, pretty, good smelling ones
should i or shouldn't i. younger guy vs older woman
ok, those other replies are just cocky, i'm way more FINE.
lime green would be more for a summer wedding.
but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry.
My boyfriend snores and I have the most terrible time sleeping!
May be u think not but Yes!!!
WE HAVE NO ROOM FOR SCREWED UP ANIMALS LIKE THIS IN OUR SOCIETY.
The best way and easiest way is to fly or drive to Las Vegas and get married there.
his answer is good enough for me...
no single man can give you what you really want.
if he doesn't start acting right, then leave him.
if yor hott too show him your boobies
a lot of guys like that - just looking for sex.
(i mess up alot at times ) but she don't forget.
WAIT FOR HIM TO ASK U OUT UNLESS UR REAL DESPRETE
u are asking do u like me
Whatever  you decide, make it completly YOURS!
her parents?u can't fix it... her friends?maybe u can talk to them nicely...but, pls specify , why?
How drunk is this girl getting?
gals luv guys with positive self image.
am doing this just for the points lol
if ya'll don't know anyting about each other u can't connect.
If you do... then i would say it was a real and worth realtionship  :)    Good luck
but really if you're used to it and you kinda like it, go with it.
cause it's buy one take one.
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST--- does he always just happen to be staring...?
It sounds like a con, but i'm telling you, chicks dig it.
you just have met the dumb ones out there that think skinny is better.
However, i always believed in the fact there's a huge different between HAVING SEX and MAKING LOVE.
You just have to make yourself walk away.
in my case i think 80%
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss just on the forehead.
I can't see my life without my husband.
I do....much prettier and smooth as silk!
:) Although, flowers are really nice even if they don't last.
it sounds like he is having too much fun while you are away.
WHY don't you just leave the girl alone?
Maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so.
i also have not a single girl friend .
Just remeber,     s go for guys who are themselves and ONLY themselves!
they feel that they are better than womans but there wrong
That doesn't mean you should let them in.
It's always in the back of my mind.
does she have other friends to gab with on the fone?
Getting married and getting child can wait but studies can't.
But you need to do this a few times.
most teen boyz prefer girls that like sex.
Don't look back and enjoy the friends you have.
NO GOOD OR BAD IS YOUR PERSONAL BELIEF ON SOMETHING.
and i dont know what i should do.
yes it is a sick habit
wait till you get 25. you would not loose your charm by then.
My bff hates my b/f and wishes for me to break up w/ him but I won't.
RELAX AND BE REAL THAT IS WHAT WE LIKE.
i dont think so, maybe they should try taking our last names
You both should pick either his or yours once you have kids.
Of course HE wants to go on.
So I guess I pick domestic goddess.
Ask her out after class again.
and people life is to short live it to the fulliest and have faith
I am man and I too feel so.... because I too am !!!
IF YOU LIKE HIM THAT MUCH,CALL HIM.
start with a basic everyday question and go from there :)
tell more ppl (my bor did)
all my friends want to do is makeout!
also actual kissing and asking if your a good kisser...
we will not regret it.at ur service anytime.
u need to reput it in add it back just like first time
You can share this with ur mom or dad.
And don't fall for the alcoholic only on weekends line that the guy above is giving.
you sorta stuck yourself out thier to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
I prefer A & B cups, myself.
be her friend first then see where it goes
dont even listen to what people not just guys say,  watch how they act.
do u fell that way ?
but if a guy asks u dont be afraid to say NO.
Obviously she don't want you if you know she likes the other boy!
There are lots of things that make a woman not like sex.
Not all guys get bored and move on.
BUT --  There's no better person to marry someday than your best friend!
depending on what yo uare looking for, freindship only, like.
i did this with my current boyfriend.
But it doesn't mean you cannot love another.
just divorce that guy... he has no honour and he dont love you.
basicaly men just want to have girlfriend for free sex!!!
if nothing work ... u have to ask him for it again  :-)
its ur PERSONALitie, keep to it, whether a guy goes out with u shouldnt determin how u act.
you have to search yourself for this one...
If the Guy is worthy enough, u wont need to
I'm confused I hate the girl to be like that ... what shall I do ?
shop around for invitations and everything else!
he then asked me, can i come with you?
Just go with your feelings if you like her so much then go with it.
So I'm only myself around guys I dont like, and you know the outcome.
I hope you find a NICE girl.
ok i have liked this on girl since i was in ninth grade.
To all my fellow girls at Cone, a big Hi and hug!
If shae like him then there is a reson .
If going to a movie is special for the 2 of you, then do that.
It just sounds like u wear the pants.
have you told her that it's kind of irritating with her having to check up on you everyday?
for the same reason thin girls prefer slender tonned guys
he handed me his cellphone and had me put in my phone number.
GO TO HAWAII...HA HA HA OR ....PAY SOMEONE...LOL
I don't understand why people think it's wrong.
Keep seaching for a believer in romance, she's out there!
If you plan on cheating on your wife...you're a freaking pig and need to be shot!
Look, he already knows that you like him, and has he said anything bad about it?
CONFRONT HIM AND ASK HIM THAT WAY YOU WILL KNOW
it's more of a trust issue i'd say.
Never stop trying to impress her .
no , you are punish , and no tv for a month
LOL I think this is better than the one on top of me...
but that didnt bother me, because like i said wa&#92;e were just friends .
Go to school you can still come home or call your family and friends.
wow, go with the one that picks on you because 9 times out out 10 he likes you
I ALWAYS FELT THE SAME WAY, BUT I MET MY TRUE LOVE AND MY VIEWS CHANGED!
take baths ?know how to speak ?
I like him and he says stuff like, if i weren't dating _ i would go out with you?
just get rid of him  you will be better off
The One time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love!
People asked me - whats the hurry?
Has he just dumped a girl and left before?
Needless to say, Im 36 now and STILL in therapy around it.
and for God sakes DO NOT be one of those controling baby mama's.
Did you ever think of that?
its been half a year- is it normal 2 still like him??
look for a man that's hot!
It is realy sweet and just what u r looking for!
Is there a reason that your not w/the baby's dad?
NO!NO!NO!IT CERTAINLY IS  MOST UNCOOL.U R SIMPLY WASTING UR HEALTH COS GIRLS JUST HATE IT.
anything bigger than a handful is a waste, probably a size c or d
I myself think that they do.
STOP trying to slap it in everyones face!!!
you should probably be looking in a public place where you are most comfortable.
...a guy asks me, 'do you mind if we cuddle?
or ask about the score of last game?
Because some couples NEVER get to that comfortable boring stage.
I always say that you shouldn't do things if your gonna regret them later.

if your a hoe then he's one to...i personally don't think your one tho
so there are some guys that only say the L word if they mean it.
I don't need a trophy girl I want a companion.
As a guy - let me say this.
BE CONFIDENT,ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.DO NOT BE ARROGANT THOUGH.ALWAYS MAKE GOOD EYE CONTACT.LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.
Then he said do you want some of MY chapstick?
there isn't a wrong or right way to kiss anyone.
because we love them its not until later when we think about it that what we have done.
I would not know... i have the same issue.

It's like breaking a drug habit.

hell yeah for the first answer.that girl answered for me.
or, what about blue and green?
A life of your OWN....a life you've been missing out on.
Confusing... yeah, i think your right.
Thing is, YOU DON'T HAVE TOO ASK HER OUT TO GO OUT WITH HER.
Maybe he's going to call you!
OK, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
in a park when i was 16 i lost my virgenate
What guy doesn't like big boobs.
you should be proud of yourself.
yeah ok men work and fix things but what else can you do?

IF YOU COULD HAVE 4 QUALITIES IN YOUR WOMAN, WHAT WOULD THEY BE.

if she sits on your bestfriends lap because she is drunk then yes it is a turn off.
See my boyfriend (go to my 360)?

If he isn't and you're still not ready, then screw him!

Move on, but you can still luv him!!
see if he is willing to go out the way for you.

I never knew life could be so good!!!!
and he said that he would call me back.

If you truely love him you will tell him
who knows but i would absouletly love that 2 be done 2 me.
what shuld i do to get her ?
Dude, you have to suck it up and introduce yourself.
there are movies that i haven't seen yet.
i think it all depends on age, upbringing, .
And that will be just s*x!
My boyfriend was definitely my friend first and it is total bliss!
who gives a crap what anyone else thinks.
also try getting some blonde highlights
just let it all out, I use art a lot to vent problems that I have.
If she likes music, make a special cd or tape.
It could be  ( Choose one & why? )
Don't worry what people will say.
I think a lot of girls like getting flowers.
i can't explain it...and no, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable or submissive.
Let him go... either that or date his brother!
Yes there are you just have to look.
YOU CAN GET THEM IN STAPLES FOR $35
Your Kid is going to have hard enough time growing up without a DAD.
My friend says I am to nice and I should tell them no.
My girlfriend always says she loves me when were passing notes during class, butshe doesnt say it confrontationally
That's right, the right relationship happened on it's own.
You will look like an idiot.
no and u shouldnt care.if u like him then stay with him.
i thnk u shud b ur tru self, hav self esteem, self confidance
Anything that is not nailed down!
make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that bad
one of my best friends had a thing with my big sister a few months ago.
Should I just forget it and move on?
There friends on the other hand, thats a different story...
ummm yes i do i think anyone does!!
my cuzin met up with some wierd old perv saying he was a hot teen that she met online
none come in my list so i choose my neighbors wife :D
I have long black hair and i love it,hubby loves it too.
you care your family and everybody in your family will love you.
Ugly (or fat) guys just take what they can get.
in the middle of the river while there was ppl watching it was actually pretty fuuny!!
its all in the eye contact
Depends on the guy some guys do some don't
it kind of gives us an idea that you may not have strong guts.
i mean if u love him and he really loves u he may want to disapoint his father.
Yes some men get right down to it with absolutly no thought for the woman.
maybe she's not a beeeatch and the skinny chick was
it does sound a little girlie.
If you want to enjoy a bit - why don't you check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms etc
there are lost of good women left you just have to look in the right place.
Hey, its like, everyone's gotta seperate some day or the other.
you win some you lose some take it with a grain of salt and be more carefull next time
happy birth day to you .
i just need someone to help me figer this out
pick the 1 w/ better treatment towards u
i'm into a 6th grade boy too!
if you end it he might not be your friend thats why i dont go with friends
stick yourself out there more, you have to do far more than eye contact
do whats best for you and he
bad teeth , bad breath and bad bo.
no one needs to know that!
if i am to ask, i'll then leave, stop the relationship and move on with my life.
Hey, do not get me wrong.
I asked him if he still liked me and he said yes but he didn't act like it.
Where am I going with this?
keep getting her younger and younger guys as one gets old get a new one for her...
You know that's if u didn't play the guilt trip.
That doesn't mean it makes it right, it means that it makes us human.
It is a mistake that can't be undone!
practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue, and tieing cherry stems w/ your tongue.
You catch her looking at you?
I know 3 guys that I can probably get away with doing something like that.
ask her out or tell her u like or admire her.
if he's gonna be an on and off guy like that i say dump him 4 good!
If they dont then you'll have to get on with your life.
i have never been to it
complement her...ask her name...dont act weird...act like u r the smoothest guy ever.
she calls him all the time.
is How should I approach her and be not just another guy hitting on her?
wait a little while then date guys that way you enjoy it more.
Someone who's never 'bitchy' just because she thinks it's cool...it ain't.
b/c you dont have any decision power what to do
I know... Why should I hide it?
Some guys just don't like to dance.
Truly she isn't ur friend, b-cuzz she won't stop bugging u!
i wish i had listened to my friends
After how much time can you conclude that it takes too long and she isn't really interested?
do i want to be in love?
Why do they want to be MARRIED???
No brainer  Oh and nice picture of George Clooney on your profile LMAO
Some woman cannot seem to find guys their own age attractive.
some do, but i would rather have a pair that were not too big
It sounds like you are both comfortable with things just the way they are.
so so sexy YES it look very nice on most any girl
sometimes its better to be very good friends first and make sure ur happy around each other
Anyway my question is.... Will I always feel that way?
Listen to Faith Hill - Love Ain't like that            its a great example
child please, dont ask that question if you dont want your feelings hurt
And the gf should accept that about if she loves you.
I think it's totally hot when a guy shaves his legs.
If u guys still keep in touch---I dont think thats the best thing to do.
i like this boy austin and i told my friend claudia to ask hin if he likes me
YOU ARE KILLING THE ROMANCE BY POPPING UP THAT STUPID QUESTION, ever thought of having fun together instead?
He's a player...no good trust me...
it depends they all like different 1's but not selfsenterd freaks like u
i think thats fantastic, maybe you should do the first move!
IF he tUrNS YoU dOwN, HES NOT WORTH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!
well just go up to her.
It's a good idea to always be honest...besides not many guys I know don't like being told they're hot!
They know the women will not chase them like good looking or wealthy men who get tons of chicks.
Just face him, say Hey I like you wanna see a movie?
thats why they call it making love.
Smile to him once in a while...then he will know...
most girls are polite she'll answer it
i would... you sound alot like my best friend.
Say hey(whateverhisnameis) when ya taking me to dinner???
it really depends on the guy but i think most guys seriously don't care.
if you want it to work out it will .
If he doesn't want to dance, then give it up.
But you know what, I feel the guy should make the first move.
without having a boyfriend would be a bit slutty.
WAIT take it from a military girl WAIT!!
you never know gurl they never show efection only when they want somthing
i am 49 yrs of age and looking for a beautiful woman to spend my time with and possibly?????
do you mean seem more sexy?
go to deleted items and it should be there
THIS IS A RED FLAG OF HOW THIS GUY IS.I WONDER!
may be becaues your name is freakgirl but if you show your face maybe not no hard feelings
that would be sooo painful you know,trust me been there done that!
Do U love her in depth?
Have fun in jail asking that question to your cell mate.
;) nah the only time u see a man emotional is when he is with his lady luv!
yes i have done it it was a lot of fun.
Gotta let the person you are with know what u want.
Ofcourse, if she calls like 5 times a day about that, then it would be crazy.
HANG IN THERE FOR ONE THAT APPRECAITES YOU.
my mom books them all of the time pat@alanatvl.com
besides don't you think he has enough to worry about?
ive been dating this guy that's younger than me.
Men play at love to get sex, women play at sex to get love.
it's got to get played out after a while.
Everybody likes to be told that they're hot, even if they don't admit it!
yes but it dipends of the guy
Mabey because ou just think they look sexy when they are running on the feild
Your too young to be talking about kissing already.
i prob will tell her soon cuz shes my best friend ha well any help would be nice.
i agree with the other preson before anyone gets hurt
I'm ready to move on, but I love him way too much!
Go out & do EVERYTHING you couldn't when you were with him/her!
Obviously, men ain't much better ;-)
What if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits.
play a truth or dare game together
he sounds like a manipulative jerk.
slow down the pace maybe, fourplay,
Death is like a big black bag full of of crack or smack or meth.
PRACTICE KISSING ME  WERE DO YOU LIVE?
no you wont huni......i was married to a complete arsehole!!!!
sounds like you really love her...no need to forget her!
tell him that u jst wannabe friends and that u r relly disappointed that he would act so dumb!!!
It always finds a way to get out in the open, just don't do it!
and yuck, what is with chest hair?
as for now i think he is mad, hurt, upset and got over you.
Give your brother some money and tell him to take a hike!!
no offense, but it kinda sounds like a girls name ya know but no disrespect intended!
be cool and ask her on a date!
well after u take her out get to know her some and then go 4 the kill,ask her out
People don't like to be played yo-yo with.
practice to unrap starburst wrappers with your tounge, the girls love it!
I don't know!...I just want the points...lol
that's not exactly true.... it's just that most girls are discreet about it...
THAT DEPENDS...ARE YOU A HOTTIE W/A BODY?
I told him it was too late...other than that, I wouldn't have minded getting flowers sometimes.
believe in is a strange way to put it.
Why can't men (or boys in your case) ever say the word LOVE?
Just enjoy the age you are and don't worry about all this.
though i'm 19, i like anything up to 30?
i had a friend in the same situation.
girls are just as perverted--trust me.
You shouldn't go out with a guy because you 'need' to.
Dude, what your sayin is she doesn't want to be more than bf and gf?
IS IT USUALLY ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE BOTH PEOPLE BEGIN 2 FEEL IN THAT COMFORTABLE,BORING, STAGE??
Probably because I knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until I met my wife.
i think as long as you dont base your relationship on sex its ok
But some guys would do that...   WHY?
if your the average guy breast size shouldn't matter.
Stay far far away from guys who can't say I LIKE YOU.
yea ask for permission by all means and watch how fast she slap the s--- out you
Honey my husband likes me for me.
my mom also has cancer and this just hits to close to home for me.
then be your best self, if he's impressed or likes you he'll talk back
you dont want anyone else but that person ever
why don't you try chatting/seeing other guys just to catch his reaction?
BUT IT IS OKAY TO KISS ON THE FIRST DATE.
guys have a problem with secrets.
I had someone get nasty with me because I was still dating?
So how do i just kiss him
I am the maid of honor for my only sister and I want it to be perfect!
unless it's with the wrong man.
