Someone watches him every move now!
Tell her to get serious and figure out her lifegoals.
You say that but you cant make it happen.
It doesn't matter if he doesn't have much experience with women.
He will care so much more about you.
My wife kissed me then walked out with the kids.
If you want to be friends, email me at jakb6hsm@yahoo.com.
I don't know maybe I'm just a liar.
that what i decided about matt.
go to the beach or someplace to eat.
it dont mean that he dont love you.
sound like hes trying hard to act uninterested and you aren't doing the same.
i'm into the doggystyle position, yeah!!
Hell, last Saturday, I had to pretend to be a shemale like 6 times!
You have to do something to get him to notice you, it's worth a try!
shit, knock him upside the head!
if you are always asking for money, you need to get yourself a job.
try talking to him first.
I didn’t really think much of it
whenever I come around, its the same old problems over and over
by her excepting you-she already knows you’re a newbie
you really should break up with him
we’re friends after I asked her to dance
I think you should call her and tell her how you feel.
It's good that you're dooing new stuff.
They told the truth.
Use it or loose it.
Be on time or someone else will take it.
yup it is but ru in luv?
he tells me they mean nothing to him
find someone else to tell him 4 u
I think he was friends with them once
Your sister can help you out
depends on if you're a guy or girl
Are you saying im a crappy person?
girls everywhere on earth
Past is the past man, let it go and have some FUN!!!
If you really liked her nothin else would matter
She's fooling herself if she thinks he was ever hers to miss at all
You are one in a million.
You can't see them, but you can feel them.
You don't have to worry about that.
It's so exciting, feeling this way about someone!
I'm a man, so it has to be about sex.
why does it seem like men are stronger, tougher, more honest and hardworking than women?
I could not stop laughing!
dump that chic while you still can, she's just using you!
good luck, your gunna need it!
don't you ask, bug him til he asks you out
check out these pix of young dudes
he wants a break. you boring him or hes doing someone else
don't get down to that level, youre better than that
me and my fiance both do that
if you show her love and trust, she will love ya even more.
neighbors complain about the noise i make, jeesh.
he won't hang on to a wife for long!
i have the same idea about wrestling.
when you feel it, you'll know what it is.
Yeah, it was the French that was used by everyone, and that works all around.
If you know what the answer is, please share it with me.
If he does things that worry you, you should not date him.
Follow what your instincts say, they will guide you.
Jealousy is really hard to deal with.
in my opinion, it would be interesting.
honey, you can trust me because I am a guy
ask your older sister again.
read this and tell her to stop.
my partner doesn't behave as such. He simply doesn't hesitate to begin and becomes immediately immersed.
That avatar has almost the same questions as mine!
I am thinking too much about all these other girls he talks to.
ibelieve being in a relationship is wonderful.
just kiss him out of the blue one day.
i intensely want to resume our relationship.
at least he would like for you to be involved.
seducing women feels like an achievement.
teeeell him to go away.
purchase a bouquet of roses for her for Valentine's Day and invite her on a date.
you're not genuinely required to request her romantic partnership.
If you think he's so cute and you like him, ask him out!!
I'm pretty sure she's not a virgin if it's during SEX!
If you wanna hit me up at erkannss14@hotmail.com we can chat about this later
There's no free lunch or fireworks :(
i like getting advice
you have to be normal.
it's difficult ambulating to converse with a woman.
do not ask via text as that is just lame.
planning is good, but don't plan excessively.
She is very loyal to you
I havent done this for someone else before, how do you do it?
I can't understand why a guy can't talk to another girl without his gf thinking he is cheating???? Like wtf?
Wow, I talked to that guy for 2 hours!!!
It's great that you are so aware of the environment.
awww, you like yourself, that's cute.
ALWAYS stand up for yourself, no matter what!
the duplicate reason that the majority of women are simpleminded.
your life will be over if you try that.
i very much want to but I do not want to do it meaninglessly.
if each week there is a different one, then I doubt it. You should, however, check the signs, especially eye contact and flirting.
why be so worried sweetie, love conquers all in the end!
trust me, I consider myself a relationship doctor.
if I am interested in a man, then I ask him on a date before another woman does.
however, that takes some time to develop.
bill Gates was probably undesirable, but look at him now!
God is happy with love, even w/o sex
Woman in the street but freak in the bed
i have no certainty, prepare his dinner meal, demonstrate your empathy.
he or one of your friends who knows him might know. Ask one of them.
she does not want you.
it is all in how you use it man, it is never the size.
no, I do not care about that of my boyfriend.
See how he deals with you going out with one of his buddies.
You have a lot of work ahead of you.
What fun things can we do together after school?
Talk to her and tell her that seriously that she's too old to act like a child.
We lie easier than men do.
they don't like you
ask if he still like you
If you keep trying to force it you'll just end up alone
You aint no virgin, don't be actin like you somthin better
just go and introduce yourself
I'll do anything once, twice if I like it!
do not do anything.
he is more mature because he is three to five years older.?
Would you really wanna be with that kinda person for the rest of your days?
The way I see it, if your gut says something's going on, then something is.
Don't act stupd and not listen to advice, you should shoot for a typical level of smarts
These days, most everybody's had sex before!
What it boils down to is me figuring out who I wanna get married to,
Doesn't matter which one, just depends on how we feel and the day.
He lies and hangs up on me.
If you hesitate, you'll never do it.
Is he killing his chances?
No, but who is every happy?
Are you happy when somebody asks you out?
I get reminded of him and what we had by just about everything.
I think he'll go to jail here although you said it was a mutual thing.
It takes me only a month to fall in love.
How can you two be in love if you can't trust him?
why does my former boyfriend continue attempting to arouse jealousy?
what is the worst thing that they could say?
have one of your family members take pictures and recording if you rent.
she may act like that again, but thank you I will be sure to tell him.
i do not get overly concerned about it.
are you and your partner still together?
pretend to like it, even though you may not.
find some Barry White songs, they work for setting the mood.
you do not have to have a relationship.
i am a twenty year-old woman.
however, an excess of positive circumstances may transform into a hindrance.
and you merely want to be genuine.
it is okay to be emotional while talking to her.
it is about the one with whom you are.
how about u first become friends with a woman
"ughhh" would be my response if i got that same lame ass kiss today
well.. don't wanna show off but ma girl is  my everything, my purrrfect love
damn, it's difficult to find friends
been there done that... my ex did the same
i think a bit of both.
Just be yourself see what happens.
When you’ve had enough you’ll say you can’t hurt me anymore.
You’d look great if you got a boob reduction.
You ain’t getting none tonight buddy!!
my girlfriend is better then the nudies i get
don't run away, he just tryna talk
kill him if he cheats on u
Leave him alone because he's giving you horrible advice and isn't the one.
my choice was corect becase I still see him now and then.
He's 23 year old and still hasn't wet his wick.
It depens on if you still care 4 her.
U shouldn't be doin it in the first place
don't worry what others think. Its okay for you to like him
he slept with his best friends wife
they're so nice
whats that mean?
I need someone to put me back together
unless its your best friend suggesting it, I would have to say no way.
you are not going to get anywhere with them so just leave them.
i always see others the way i want to see them not how they really are.
i didn't want to be lonely, so i did it.
i am sure that they feel the same way about women, lol.
Some girls do and some don't ??? Everyone is different.
If he skirts the question or gets mad, red flags should go up!
When a man really loves you, he dont' try to push you into havin a abortion.
Did he say he doesn't luv you or just that he's not right for u?
gettin cozy wit u would be nice.
why do men lie lots?
if she wants to confuse you, I suppose it is time to leave her for someone new.
mind your personal hygiene.
try searching somewhere other than where degenerates spend time.
do not do something which you will later regret.
if I married the lady of my dreams, that would be everything that I have dreamed of.
i've gone to some before
I've hung wit big guys before
most men ain't stupid
mine's is large
Come on ladies, if a girl like you, u should know.
You sure that's what you want?
Well, it's not meant to be if he tries to say goodbye
Have you seriously not seen the Paris Hilton video yet???
i reallllly need someone to love!!!
You guys need to be able to ajust and try to be understanding!
A real harry chest i don't understand, a little bit I do.
He make you happy, tell your family.
If she happy with her looks, support her.
no I didn't, I waited to be asked out by him.
That dude got hitched.
Tell them you love them and see if they return the feeling.
You've got every right to be angry.
Do you want to be with someone who doesn't know his own heart?
My friends mock him all the time.
you are among the worst people in the world.
but, the difficult part is making this person stay with us.
go ahead and send a text message.
not being a virgin is a sin in the eyes of the Lord.
all right, his age is between 14 and 16, and your age is what?
ur hot mature and happy
sucks when men do that
Will not be w/all hair.
find someone whowants to share future w/u
he love you single
he thinks its good
things that make me no longer aroused are body odor, passing gas, and constant belching.
i still think about him.
you can ask him out, and see how he responds.
it was a different time, with different ladies.
trust me when I say that you cannot change them.
you do not need him or anyone else to degrade you.
he loves me more, because I was a virgin on our wedding night.
if you are really in love, buy a plane ticket and go get married to them.
i enjoy watching a woman masturbate and will have sex with her as soon as she finishes.
u sshould let her know your true feelings.
women can be friends, but not men?
simply behave as an unruffled man, refrain from treating girls presumptuously.
There is strength in ya.
She will leave this fling and move on.
How long have you been married since that happened?
If you ask and he doesn't like your kids, leave him since family comes first.
That’s a whole other story!
So I just tell my hubby to get out?
I’ve heard that guys actually prefer virgins.
Is that a problem?
I'm sorry but I can't tell you anything since i don't live there.
You're sinning if you're hanging out with unsaved people.
I say go to the movies or go look at the sights, or stuff like that.
When we meet we share similar feelings.
Tell her that you have been wanting to tell her something.
You'd want it more than one time.
He did it once, so he will do it again.
break up wit her.
I care for him and i need him!
What's wrong with chillin?
Homosexuals like me - dunno why
Groovy! MY BFF hearts me
She go HAM but maybe she illin'
Sound familiar???
They just wanna be loved
i want her to like me...
Our family hated they had an interracial relationship... my dad and great gma especially!
i'm tryin to say beauty is only on the surface
A lot of people think blue is the color representing love because red makes them think of blood.
Can you honestly say you want him back?
You didn't wipe even though you used the bathroom there?
You should kick him to the curb and see how you do on your own.
From now on during sex will the tv be on because that was BAD!!!
Youre gonna be a awesome sister.
One day he started hitting on me.
since you like that one man, other guys are gonna be jealous.
Don't make a issue out of something thats so natural.
i repeat, this is something that you want to tell him face to face.
the headboard thing ruined the mood, and I did not get to come.
i luv my wife very much.
if they agree to the request, you should ask him to spend time with you.
am 26 have waited till marriage for sex
do they think he just isnt sure of himself or what?
he is barebackin it
think she knows u like her without telling her that?
i'm already fallin just cant
Chicks love dudes that aren't like everyone else.
If they love you they'll always be there for you, no matter what.
Yes, just do them together then.
the answer is simple, don't do it!
did you try to hard?
Men work till the sun goes down, but a woman's job is never done.
That sounds just like flirting.
The girl you are into will be by herself and she hates that.
I like him but can't say i'm in love with him.
If you do it right it won't matter.
If you never try anything with her you'll never know if it works
He'll never know what you want unless you tell him
So you're starting to hate your lovers friends
Do you have any idea what I had to do to get over this.
Love isn't all bad, you should give it a shot.
some creepy guy followed me in the store, he was super scary!
Do not be selfish, give pleasure during sex not just get it.
tell her that if she wanted you she would come fuck like monkeys and she would suck and swallow.
Its normal to think but not act on it like killing yourself.
Knowing you are the shit is the key says my dudes.
He would care about the small crap if he really cared about you.
I think about him 24/7.
You can see the ideas from Knot.
You have a hubby, so what are you complaining about?
He will propose to you.
i want a man who is true to hisself.
do whatever you want.
the ones that pop up unexpectantly are the ones that are really from the hart!
if my woman died, i would kill myself, i couldn't live with out her.
if he doesn't do what you want, no sex for him
he doesn't want you to do that
tell him you don't wanna fuck
You need to worry when he starts seeing somebody else.
I don’t get this thing they call love.
I’m humbling myself by telling you I have all the qualities you talked about.
I won’t and a friendship just because we don’t agree.
I talk a lot in the Yahoo chat room.
get used to crappy guys, who just want to use you.
have sex with math geek, they know how to handle those curves, ha, ha.
that's not my thing.
one day you'll wake up and just know.
i'm married, trust me, i know.
Don’t be so careless or you’ll end up pregnant.
Hes trying to control you, get rid of him!!!
I REALLY like bad boys, how bout you?
If they really love you, they’ll except your flaws.
love is the same for everyone.
that is not very fair to the man with whom you are currently in a relationship.
i despise that type. Remember that money can purchase many things but class, style and grace are not among them.
it depends on the size of the male gentialia.
i tried to converse with him, but he has yet to call me.
my man works out so he has a nice bottom.
no need to doubt him!
gotta raise yourself.. he doesn't have to feed you..
well if you wanna be with him, don't leave.
even if it feels awkward, just ask him. If he loves you it will be worth :)
I'm here in urine Bangalore.
I'm always even happy when I wake up and go to work
You have to look into your own heart see if you have feelings for him.
Take no for an answer if she's not willing.
If he really likes you you'll know it.
When you change your mind, you wont be talking to her.
My guy friends are like my bros.  We're cool.
What happened in class?
Ask her if she's into you.
thats messed up she did that in front of u
the bad guy seems to be my thing
pray to the great dude G--O---D and his baby the big J
take her out, maybe go shopping.
i promise that every female who believes she excessively obsesses over sexual activity has no actual understanding.
it will cost you three points for each answer.
i believe that it is a myth and that you are all intercouse addicts.
you should leave him alone because he got what he wanted and perhaps no longer wants to talk to you.
I really need imput from other people
you can't buy off your kid, you gotta put in the time
you want a good thing don't just stand around waiting
I need your help, the wife and I've  been trying to get pregnant and can't
depends on my wife's mood right then
i've married two times. With the first one, I knew right away. My second marriage is still unravelling.
if you email me, I will tell you everything that I know.
you've admitted he is in love with someone else.
you should believe in yourself, which is really sexy.
because their thinking is not clear.
Be patient until things chill
Men won't cheat if its hot under the sheets
go slow you'll be able to tell by her body language
give her attention and chocolate lol
i do not like that word
depends, how old?
if you love other people, they will love you in return.
where he asked you out is his decision, and you made a mistake.
you should tell him that a mutual respect for one another has to be established.
you will get out only what you put in.
have you ever comitted a felony?
The true reason you're a winner or not is finding love!
act liike a girl trying to find an NSA hookup and shoot him an IM.
Your partner gets hurt if you go out to have fun when you're with them.
I wanna get together with my ex-bf.
Shit, that's gotta have been a super tough thing to feel.
some homies don't like anybody touching that ass
Until you fall in love, it can be hard to understand
How fast into the first date.
not all guys only think about sex
that behavior may be for a reason
Yuk, yuk who has a chicken butt? Not me!
I'm a female, I can't have sex with a guy unless I have strong feelings for him.
Who knows? If he has friends, it could mean he has the hots for you
I don't know, but if you find it please let me know!
He cheated on your cousin and I feel like he will probably cheat on you too
It's rude to not return the favor
If anyone knows him, let me know. I miss him.
What is a relationship if you can't talk to each other about that stuff?
I don't think its a sin, but it certainly leads to sex!
But if you do it, have fun.
from the sound of it, you are more interested in virginity than are most guys.
my boyfriend and I broke up after eight years. I really did love him.
it was an eye-opening experience for me.
what do u think about marriage????
Is it possible to have custody if hes a stay @home dad
i think ya got a boyfriend.
hey try it, it could work for you.
They are not bffs anymore!
But we never got together, he stuck me in the "friend zone".
He even loves my baby
chill your cash flow
start with what you really DONT want to do.
If you’re too shy to talk to her try doing things she likes to get her to notice you.
Maybe she’s acting weird because she’s hiding something?
Depends on how you feel, there's a bunch of different factors.
Most men need to have sex all the time.
Can you handle a serious relationship like that?
let her have one and see what she does in front of all those people
can you even read this stuff you wrote?
you've got mad skills, man.
the more you throw yourself at the fella, the more he'll open up to you
it's my choice, no one else's matter
let them go no matter how long takes to do so
u need some cash i got ya
Should I dump her or keep hanging on hoping that she really does love me?
If you want to surprise her, just say it in the middle of the conversation .
I think that love takes a really long time to die.
i am intersted in him, however, I do not know that he is intersted in me.
i want it more than guys do.
try thinking about how they feel.
what in the world should I do then?
a woman wants many things from men.
want more 2 listen send me an email
agree but dont think its bad
now she sees ur happy and sees wat she threw away
Just one, the first and the last one.
Because it's hard to get back to being friends once you've crossed out of the friend zone.
Admiration is nice but not reason enough to be kissing.
It's way too long if it hurts the woman and she can't take it.
yeah dudes not gonna change toilet seat stayig up
yeah he's just tryin to get it being ok for him to cheat
keep an eye out he doesn't seem loyal AT ALLL
shit man I ain't soft just on the level
she don't want to pull any other dudes that's what she doing
men do that
he didnt want a 2nd chance
he'll become jealous. Inform him how you dislike that as well.
perhaps you become too attached after intercourse and it frightens men into leaving.
young lady, it is alright if you do not want to have sex with a man.
does it matter since you received yours?
it is hard to get rid of the memories.
my name is Shaba, please send me a friend in Amsterdam.
women like strong men.
you need to be careful.
some men are just different.
if they don't like u for who u are, u don't need 'em.
If they made you happy, you won't flirt with other females.
Buy some flowers, and tellhim your in love w him.
Do u still have feelins for them>
You need a side piece, keep your bf but find another person.
Ur mother already kicked uncouth, none of her business anymore.
Serious girls are serious about stuff like that.
Guessing U already tried talking to him?
If he’s into just being friends, move on.
never let people tell you any differently.
If they’re nice then why be mean?
if hes still on you let im GO
hug prob wasnt the best idea
havent met the one as of yet
dont cross me ive got wisdom on my side
Why didn't they say?
a wolf & a lab
when i was in bora bora sent him a post card
u will meet someone who will make u forget bout him
Hot women are at the librabry & WalMart
Heck yeah it's possible. It happens to me all the time.
Also you're still waiting for him to put a ring on it.
She's testing you when she looks at you.
I owe you big-time for helping me plan this wedding.
Just remember the more you give the more he takes.
Try it sometime, you won't be disappointed.
You need to find a younger man to date.
No, I hope the girl that dumped me drops dead. I won't even give her a second thought anymore.
The egos are fighting.
It really depends on what's going on.
I think a woman should decide for herself.
Clues from secret admirer are pointing to you.
If you dump a guy and he's not desperate, he won't hit you up again.
Is there a chance you could be pregnant?
just ask him to hang sometime if you think he wants to
if she's wasted you gotta make her agree that you guys wont hang out
Turns out that my lady was really a dude.
Dont be agressive, just be nice and stuff
i saw you on a CD, famous singers are the best
existence possesses such a quality, individuals causing pain for one another.
they have to be relaxed and in the mood for love.
i would be honest with him, he will most likely not care.
For 4-5 months we've been talking
Hopefully u will find new besties soon!!
I saw that to when I went out there!!!
It's just because guys hormones are totally different from girls.
i like a girl with small breasts and a cute behind.
how am I going to be able to handle not being a jealous girlfriend.
if it has been a long time, then you should say 'no' in response.
they are weak minded, it is not your fault.
how much does the child's father participate?
why was he imprisoned?
Say I don't need no more friends
Apparently you have to have a big dick to be able to have a serious relationship
They have to acknowledge it
She is totally oblivious to the fact that she ruined my life!
Get over it move on with your life
Most guys can have females friends to right?
I'm sure it'll be alright with that
Take a look at that.
pity does not cause me to have intercourse with you.
is it normal to have intercourse with one's boyfriend?
it does not have anything to do with you, though.
you should approach them first.
no one knows as in the end it is all up to you.
noo, not unless they specifically said that it is no longer cancelled.
she is not romantically interested in you—or, possibly, you approached her too aggressively.
i do not think there is anythign wrong with it.
you will know you are in love when you can not stop thinking about the person.
You're 40, woman, go find someone your own age.
Getting married turns people irresponsible and abusive.
I'd believe he's sleeping around
depends on the situation
If I'm a dude will you date me?
It’s not only for lovers.
Would I put myself in dangr for others?!?
Im just wondering whats happning here?
take it easy so he dont hafta hear he sucks at kissing.
Don't matter what ya say its gonna hurt them no matter what.
lets know 1 another better.
he likes me and hes 14-16 years old!
it may be hard, but act like you're not interested.
so, make sure she is aware of how much you care about her.
what are the signs of a man flirting with you?
you ask her and see if she replies honestly.
flirt with them and say you love them.
time is of the essence, you should move on.
he screamed when he was looking for his razor.
it means that she probably would not have left you if you would have been more calm in the past.
break off relations with him. You're squandering your days by remaining in a relationship.
neither of us could think of a preferable alternative.
my sister has since broken up with him, but she is pregnant with his child.
find her something with meaning.
when shes not hitting you up anymore.
almost forgot, ladies, have you ever used sample makeup from the mall?
there's still hope for those chicks.
Many men are not dumb so don't say that
Yep, a large man is a no for me in a relationship.
Jim is who I know him as
when she hardly ever sleeps with you
DO NOT sleep with him, it will drive him wild!
why would he refuse to speak with me?
after that, I learned that he is interested in me.
i get hungry two times every day.
ask, she will probably like if you can help.
it would be in places where African American men are.
BTW, there's talk that condoms aren't 100%.  I'd rather have that than nothing at all.
Check it out for me?
She may've been able to fool people before, but she wont be able this time.
It depends on how she feels about herself.
Yet, only when they're horny or to spice it up.
best way to get back at him, move on and forget he was ever a part
loyalty, kindness, and sweetness are crucial
no matter what keep it that way even if she gets mad
it doesn't even matter how you use it sometimes
our aim is to make the ladies comfortable
also that his genitals are small.
how are you trying to fix the the trust, and what kind of girlfriend is she to you?
especially if you are used to regularly having intercourse.
due to them possessing singularly defined thinking.
you can tell him. Unless he is gay, he would do that.
Did I tell you lately that I think you're hot?
You can't ask dumb questions like this.
They have less mature brains than we do.
Maybe not love but who knows?!?
He’s not on drugs!!
You never know when a man is going to act as a coward toward his responsibilities!!
It’s heaven AND hell, just look around.
Whatever you’re saying is soooo true.
I enjoyed reading what you got, but thanks for the info
have fun or keep active
only if you think you need a bf
Men are like dogs in that, they're hunters, they wanna chase you... so run.
how do I figure out if my bf is in love w/me?
People certainly know you're single with that questions.
maybe i'm just timid or scared
You're going down a bad road be careful!
it keeps you from having fun with other people
Yes, I like the bad boy type!!
get out there and have some fun while you can.
u will know fast enough if you take off your clothes in front of him.
if u can help me out with by recommending me to some of them, i'd be thankful.
at least that way i would be into her.
the lady will wait if she truly loves the dude.
she does not answer me when I ask her to be my girlfriend.
it is only what is on the inside that matters.
do you suppose that married women perform fellatio?
it has to be your choice.
get with better men because I will expect her to do the same.
if you're unable to tolerate a friendship with him, then allow him his solitude.
if you work at it, it will continue to grow forever.
do whatever makes you happy
All the hot guys are fags.
I'm single but it's hard to get a gf. Help?
Dad's like that, too.
Boys think I'm hot.
She felt me and my lover there.
She friends zoned you but she likes you!
I don't believe in love.
How grown up does the kid seem?
What does love even mean?
true unless I figured out i didnt want it
people want the perfect man but dont want to be a perfect person

Maybe hell ask u out.
Their aint noway to get that info.
Dating is gonna b hard 4 U.
Hes as dumb as me.
this is quite an egregious negative situation.
think about children after you ask him to marry you.
it depends upon whether you are also a young woman or not.
Here's my advice. Trust her.
Unless you like being treated like crap move on
it is not boring but fulfilling.
i am a handsome twenty-eight year old.
nobody comprehends what true problems are until you get married and have children.
why do the women there possess facial hair?
no, they cannot because somewhere deep down under there is an attraction to each other.
he enjoys flirting, and he is an attractive man.
who or what can I turn to for help?
he will find a girl who loves and cares about him.
he will not help if he says no.
Dont worry, things will improve, I swear to god
You're no adult, you should talk to your mom about that stuff.
Dont screw with his emotions, just hush up
only if they are as into the situatoin as much as you are
My gf loves it in the ass.
Maybe you married a dud.
Second, if a dude is a cheater, you are hanging out with the wrong kind of dudes.
Dude: I'm a caveman  Girl:What's this?
YOu should do it if you really love him
IMO what sixteen said.
Don't make plans please on Valentines not matter HOW good it sounds.
Doesnt matter how smart they are can still be dumb when it counts!!!
They'll get it sonner or later
Relax... Just do it... That's really not the best point in ur life
you really believe they won't cheat...
you can cry if you wanna, but you should use your words instead
it seems like they love you and wantchu back
i also am partial towards children, but I am not one.
you're creating the problems with him.
i do not think its a good idea unless you have a perfect partner.
yu can only rely on faith that what the other person says is truth.
inform him of your feelings for him.
if a male/female is unable to be forthcoming, proceed to erase him/her from memory!
however, on occasion, he behaves as if he continues to do so.
did you cheat on her?
comment on her hair, outfit, or shoes if you are fairly attractive.
i move on if a man does that to me.
It depends. Not all men are the same.
Bingo! You just figured it out for yerself.
Step back and take a good close look, you'll know if he's up to no good.
Show your appreciation so they know you care and weren't just using them.
There's a 2 month waitin list for gettin into a poor house.
Its not worth it if they aint right for you.
Maybe because you're doing something wrong.
get rid of all his stuff.
its important if you're going to be single without a family.
females usually love jewelry if you have the money to spend!
just ask, all she could say is no, but, you will never know unless you do.
you will get asked out.
no, I think you are unable to spell adequately.
you need to prove she has been unfaithful and get divorced.
it's fantastic that you're attracted to this woman.
you don't know what will happen, which is why they call it love.
because, as you know, I attend the same school as you.
you may not find her attractive; but, she is happy with herself.
if you don't wanna spew it in his face, scream it out in front of your mirror when no one is there
you slept with him already?
they dont use they brain like they shud!
we gettin closer every day.....
men never seem to get women,,,its just the way f the world
i think that your feeling for him is only lust.
it did not work after I tried it.
it won't be illegal. That would be holding an individual for ransom, instead of dating her.
if she is right for you or not, her response will tell you everything!
I think it good to try it before you buy it
It happened without you even knowing it
If my sister's friend it a bitch, I would dip out.
You shouldnt buy a woman lingerie unless she says she wants it
How do I show that I love her so much
smile before you look away so the woman does not think you find her unattractive.
if he only likes her a little bit, then he should not get very upset.
are you sure that she truly has feelings for you?
The choice is yours if you don't want to have sex don't
I'd watch her if were you, doesn't seem like much of a friend
It could be because you're special
Find someone on the same level as you.
I'm dealing with the same thing right now I can definitely feel ya
they do not appeal to me at all.
what can I do when I see her being so upset?
take some time to reflect on yourself.
however, currently he once more pays me no mind.
Get you’re friends together and go out for a good time!
Think about what would happen if you're married one day.
try practice a low speaking voice and confidence while at the gym.
find a card to show how you feel.
Men are SUPER competitive!
a lot of thoughts com during the night while you are sleeping.
additionally, inform him you had an unpleasant experience with another man who tried some things which made you upset.
god makes many different moves.
do not have intercourse with him and wait for his response. I hope this advice was helpful.
look into his eyes and you will know
you are my number 1, don't question it
he needs to get out in the world
I like this girl and she doesn't know it. What should I get her?
I like Hispanic guys better.
When things are bad, do you still really want each other?
If he is rich you better put up with him!
You can tell how worried you are cause of your spellings.
It does not matter what anyone else thinks, just that you two love each other.
What is Gwen Stefani's husband's name?
Call and get it over with.
That is they type of loving relationship people want but never work hard to get.
People don't just randomly do things unless there's something in it for them.
Who cares how big she is, she's still really hot.
My friend is going nuts over a dude that doesn't even like her.

I perfer guy that don't screw around with chicks all the time
do yr best to some good electrics out of it
be honest w/ him about yor concerns
i ruined the friendship between Jon and Matt.
you could attempt to create a realtionship between him and a friend.
always obey your instincts.
it's possible that his girlfriend's homeliness drives him to seek satisfaction elsewhere.
don't be something you're not!
be smarter then that. Don't believe that bull.
if he's going to treat you like that you need to move on.
does anyone here speak english?
post an ad in the paper
YOU CANT KEEP IT UP IF SHES PREGNANT
MEN BE LIKE THAT
THAT BULL YOU JUST HAVE ISSUES WITH ASIAN CHICKS

my love for her is true
Hate to tell you, it'll be worse after you married.
im an old fashioned guy
depends on your relationship
pop in say hey anytime
Don’t lose a friend over it.
It’s because your only giving 90% effort.
We think we’re hitting on them, but they just don’t get it.
If it doesn’t wok out just start all over again.
I like chicks who are loud and crazy.
I'm gonna find new friends in Amsterdam
Is she hotter than me?
If your surfing the web... then Yahoo Answers-duh.
I know from experienc
emotions and feelings are what count.
how old are you?
i'm aware that this is easier said than done.
looks are not as important compared to how someone treats you.
send him away if he gets too possessive.
Your back won’t hurt so much if you get a boob reduction.
First guy is right, make some more money and just be yourself!
I’m 12 and just got a gf.
That's just how life it.
I'd wait until she is ready for a bra
You want to know if he still thinks your pretty.
He will love you more and be surprised by it.
Why not just ask him the question in an email
just tell her you love her then give her some space.
Lol. I was about to ask you the same thing!!
I gotta find something cheap but unique.
Yeah, you can see some health benefits if you ABSTAIN from sex.
It’s never goi g to happen if your a teen or something.
what are you doing?
they are not the kind men that you want in your life.
if you are attracted to a man, then converse with him and begin a relationship.
i once heard that that was not true.
the reason that your are so jealous watching other couples is that you cannot get your own guy!
perhaps that's simply his identity.
do not tell him first. Tell your mom, or the social worker for your school and allow them to tell your parents.
you are absolutely correct that you did the right thing.
kss the man in front of that woman.
well r they sick or good?
he says jump and you say how high
tell him that he needs to stop and let her be... he needs to get out there and find him a different one
she was a outcast rocker punk in a band with big blue eyes
if they get mad because you won't have sex, you need to move on fast.
A woman being taller than a man isn't bad, but it's funny.
If it's sacreligious, I'm out of answers.
Your mom is seeing him
I like brunettes, brown eyes, flawless skin, and a cute ass.
Good luck with that
Don't ask how to get girls to dig you.
I usually don't worry about a guy's butt.
He seriously really likes you a lot.
I love my new Lab puppy!
Though it is really tough to avoid.
no, but when you are in love, intimacy will feel like a totally different experience.
imagination is the key because you only get what you can imagine.
i  believe she simply wishes to come to America like all others, however that is just my opinion. Take care.
that is a tough call so I would recommend that you date her friend to make her jealous.
how do I ask another woman to join is in the bedroom?
It’s cause your single w/o a date.
I think u should ask a dr or somebody u can trust.
Should I tell my guy he’s driving me crazy when I’m with him.
Get stuck in the rain, get soaked and tell ur guy to warm up by snuggling.
She either really likes u, but doesn’t want to admit it or she just wants to make it difficult.
see if he cares if u sent those pics
first and last time w/sex and tv watching
Tell your husband he needs to step up to the plate!
I want to know if your lonely.
It means you're a big sis, we've got a new baby!
I will go cray cray on your ass if I see you with that ho!
You should play volleyball or b-ball if your really into sports.
No sex if you can't handle the kid
Mo tough than strong
Still ur friend, tho
Just take her out on a date.
Not all experienced men know what they are doing
Ask her if she has ever been sexually intimate with a man.
By the way, tell your man why you don't like him.
Me, i'm gonna say yes.
If you around 12, then no, you to young.
i'm fond of one particular gentleman, Jon, and in the past, he had fondness for me, as well.
one may be good at coitus and the other is good at listening.
men are beautiful regardless of their appearance or deeds.
and yes, I have many chances.
it seems as if he may have discovered an alternative method for providing himself bodily pleasure.
It's ok to be cheap.
She's a lady in the street but a freak in the sheets.
relax with spending.
as a man, I know many men are in relationships for personal gain.
whhat's the reason you're not willing to let nonsense increase?
it really depends on whether she is unattractive, and how much so.
i do not think so. Unless, however, you are trying to commit suicide?
i would sya no, unless you love it.
all she dreams about is him when she does.
if you smell, you should use soap.
that's how I envision it.
you could say, 'Hello dear, would you like to have a soda?'
I don't have a shot at him because a different girl already likes my crush.
The information they gave was little vague....
i'm just Mexican, nothing else.
Cheer up. There are plenty of fish in the sea.
hard to live if she gone from life
she jus knows it isnt love
doesnt mattr if they m/f
It's your own choice to make.
You gotta move on, it might hurt but it's necessary.
Who are you thinking about?
You gotta have fun while you still can and you're young.
You first impression creeped you out, so stop txting her.
Yeah, that's what I'd do if i wanted to break up
I PROMISE NOT TO BRING MY FRIENDS
If some strange wacko were watching me I'd probably get worried
If you don't want to be with each other then it's obviously over
are u a schizo or something?
we make em nervous and they loose their brains
4 times a week we get it
if she gets herself off in front of me that gets me off
Believe what u want
With someone that disrespects you like that why you even giving him the time of day?
Men get all goofy when they're around women thy like
If you tired of guessin jus ask him if he want to git married
as long as you love each other who cares what it looks like
It will pay off eventually.
What are you talking about?
Or maybe his male ego is so weak, he can't deal with a woman knowing about it.
He was a jerk, mentally and physically to me.
means he values u a lot
HE ISNT IN LOVE W/YOU
could they like each other?
most guys arent dumb just w/wrong people
wedding isn't just about you
we have sexual interactions over the telephone every day and never tire of it.
you should do something that most people have not.
prhaps she no longer boasts regarding him to her acquaintances, as before.
experience personalized entertainment at this point given your unattached status.
you should not have sexual relations with your cousin.
sometimes you must let men know your preferences.
the speed of the relationship depends on how long you have been talking.
here is not where you will find one.
young boys want to become men, and men want women.
trust your sense of humor, your beauty, your intelligence, you relationships and how you connect with others, and characteristics like that.
i would not want or need anything else.
there is an extremely attractive man in my neighborhood.
he either loves you or not.
Shoot me an email if you find out.
Like him? it's okay then.
You  might have  freaked her out.
Guys and gals both have them.
Get hitched at the court house.
So, whats your turn on?
For a good time -call me.
ur just a booty call
im outside ur window
first kiss made me dizzy
men... some do and some dont
u dont want to admit it but i think "no answer" is what you mean to say
Men go straight for it, women want to take they time.
Suck that dick once in awhile.
He might just be checking on you to see how you are.
If you ask him, we won't lie.
Valentines day stinks.
to make the house look and smell clean: get rid of the cat, steam the carpet, furniture, and bed linen, and, spray for insects.
if he cared about you, he would not have looked at the other girl.
end the relationship, he is not interested in you.
you must speak out against it.
is putting a ad in the local paper something we can do?
i am asking because it seems that men are always ready for sex.
it is a sexual story as well.
i apologize, but that is repulsive.
hey, brother, if you do not have a Miami address, you're best served by traveling to this location. It is the most ideal.
if you like her, ask her out.
I don't, but Home Simpson is pretty hot!
Tell him he makes a HOT vampire!
Astrology is a joke!
when you find your diamond, hopefully he feels the same about you.
I went to one with a belly dancer, but it was lame.
No one is able to decide how their dream acts.
It could that's why they have the name fantasies.
You might as well just ask him.
Does he get into sex toys?
sex it up, like using food or cover yoself wit whip cream
good luck, you get em
don't let her mess wit your head.
say that your sad
some can and some can't live wit out it.
partner, friend or family any one
work it for it to work
seriously how old? im 25
way too weird
shes a player she wants a toy to play with
think older kids like mini golf, laser tag go karts
that doesnt work say u have a STD
let her know you dont like it and if she dont listen, then run!!!!!
there are alot of phillippino chicks who meet men on line and then marry them.
how come you didn't ask him out, huh?
if being broken up makes them happy, then you should be happy too.
he will stare at other women when im not paying attention
we aren't together anymore
you know who he is because you've known him a long time.
you arent living in reality.
The next day i had dinner with my boo
Do you like each other's children?
I would prefere chess cake
That'll let her know she matters vs. your buddies.
If love is what it's about and you're able to, it's most likely positive.
There's a bunch of different dudes,
How come she can't see since we all can?
We've flirted a bunch, but I still have no idea.
sit down with them and let them know you need understanding and support from them.
i get asked about sex alot.
cut him off now, so when y'all get married he will know the deal.
As long as you have a condom you can do it anytime.
You have to just be upfront and honest
I'd try working with him on it.
My sisters high school sweetheart is now married to me.
preggos = poor taste in clothes
do you have a good iron skillet?
you've got to make sure you ask him questions directly if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you.
if i was just capable of being stupid i'd have gone on more dates.
he keeps saying that he respects and understands why I want to wait.
what the fuck should i say
dont be a cry baby
adapt to life because its like a roller coaster
if he isnt serious about liking you, forget about him
there is someone for everyone ive heard
Ask me how I know he didn’t love you
you should watch pornography together
What options do a girl have?
go  on with your life and get out of this relationship
don’t mess with a friend’s younger sister
if he loves u he wouldnt care hed be there
call the cops if hes not paying child support
please dont tell
is that even a ? for a man?
talk with her and ask her if she likes u
you might be bi if you are attracted to men, too.
she never go over you from the first time you all broke up.
how can i tell him that?
what am i supposed to do in this situashion?
it depends on the chick, if she likes your butt she will do it.
just trying to stop from fighting, she so easily gets jelly
its the BEST feeling youve ever felt in the universe
Im just tring to convince her whats gonna happen before it comes
YoU can figure it out by the way they look and Talk two you how they think yof you
starts out quiet then louder til all of a sudden.......... I MAX IT OUT!
I’ve learned lots a new things.
you need to tell her that ya love her.
I had that one with your mom.
i can only answer 1 question at a time.
I am pretty sure that that is what a guy would want.
you will get your answer depending on what she says.
its all good, plus i but some dough down on a food buziness there.
I want to spice things up, any ideas?
i make a different choice every so often.
go on many dates with different men in order to forget him.
you have two choices. Get over him, or wait for him.
ponder it. My opinion is to terminate the relationship.
can talk if u want
ya if ur a dude
Someone finally asked me but i thought that i would never be asked out on a date
If you are asking these questions you are too young to get married
When i was married I did not cheat on my wife
a woman will never admit to being wrong
who knows, they should be left alone
Youll feel good if ya just laugh!
you gotta make sure you wanna communicate.
you can help yourself by helping each other and trying to get where he is coming from.
theyll realize the truth one day.
before you really screw up, go talk about it
it's best to break it to him gently, asap
ask him to go to dinner or a movie with ya
I had to get her drunk before I tried to kiss her
ask God what to do, ppl will come and go
You two been hanging around with your parents?
No, if they are only sick.
I don't want him to at all.
reflect on his personality, is he a nice, decent person?
be a friend. Allow him some time to be alone.
allow your personality to show. Do not pretend to be someone else, women can sense that.
it is easy to say yes, but I suspect it would be difficult to actually do.
refrain from initiating action because she'll receive her due at some future date and time.
I don't want to ask him if he still likes me because I still dig him a lot.
I believe that people want what they cannot have.
Pass along the info and let me know if you need help.
Do you really want our moms to lie?
Not so sure if girls are bad liars.
Did you guys have a conversation as to why he cheated
Telling someone news over the phone or in person is definitely better.
Things are not simple with kids at all
Distance makes lies harder to tell
Laying on the covers candles lit lights off
He broke up w/ me after a few dayz
Love is caring for some1 or something
w8 bcuz ur a kid
That means u can have it all!
if he sayz no hes cheatin
go back to sucking your tiny dick
are you a dude or a chick?
totally i would Since it's free
if your still into your ex, dont go for someone new
Me and my husband moved in a couple of weeks ago, you should too
That is the same reason as mines
Some men jsut need some extra stimulus to complete the task
Follow it up, if you are into him
Whatever goes on in a guy's head?
he know we don't know each other
if he don't admit it, don't allow it if you don't want it
men don't think wit they heads
women love men for their personality l!
You like a guy and he likes you two.
I know it’s a lot but trust me!!
Make sure he’s helping with you’re bills too!
Wait til he’s drunk then take off your clothes!!
Have sex with the person you love.
nope, i wouldn't date a stripper!
don't care for big boobs.
then jon asked me if id be jealous if he hung out with that girl Alyssa
So what do you like to do?
I can't pay attention to this and I expect other men can't either.
They'll love you if you can make em laugh.
They said "I can't leave my kids". The other said "Then why did you ask me to get a cup of coffee?"
I'd guess between 3-4 hundred.
Don't be with someone who don't like you for yourself, there's plenty of other fish to enjoy while your young.
So what did you think was gonna happen??
Give it a try. You might find out there's more than sex!
I married my man in 2001, July 7th to be exact. Then we had 2 GLORIOUS weeks in Hawaii
how do i get out of it
are u in love w him?
it's best if you just don't worry about it
when u are in love you'll know bc you'll never feel bored. that's true love!
why don't you have a job? if you did you'd have your own money...
are you making each other happy? Then do what you're doin!!
Well I enjoy good love songs and don't care that it''s sappy.
don't have sex with him and you won't come across as being cheep!
any advice on what to do when you're interested in a woman but not sure if she is into you??
Are they interested?? Then the chase is over!
That don't mean he don't care for you!
he could not have noticed that.
due to the majority behaving as oversexed morons unable to obtain it at all.
how old are you? Also, I would like to be your friend.
the decision is entirely up to you but don't spend too much time looking.
Don't push him to do something he isn't ready to do.
That shirt just shows too much.
The money is probably nice but there is a lot going on that people don't know about.
You better act fast or they may find someone else.
This can be a lesson.
Do I stay or do I go?
First of all the age difference is bad so proceed with caution.
It made me laugh my ass off when I was reading it.
Go to a party and talk to everyone.
Because they think they're hot and wanted, they act that way in dating.
He needs to know that the worst thing he can say is no.
I want him to be kind and respect me, isn't that asking too much?
He is not worthy of your time or attention.
Any thoughts on this, eh?
This guy my friends likes wants to get to know her bettter
we girls will never know the answer to that question.
i think you should since women feel mature for their age.
are you in love with someone?
i stopped a child who was running across the street in the rain from jay walking.
do not give him want he wants so easily, because it will give him too much control faster than what you want.
it is strange that someone so young is answering questions on here.
if you would like to, you can have intercourse.
do not allow a man to control you.
Did you trap him or did he volunteer to tell you?
Should you really marry a guy who has been accused of two attempted murders?
You have to accept the truth, sad as it is.
If she seems shy, that means she probably likes you a lot.
I would even give away my soul, but not if it's unrequited love.
Make them take a lie detector test that's not a fake.
I'm having a bad day too.
Even on silent mode, he'll see the missed calls.
Where is your home?
Ask to take her to dinner.
in actuality, however, they are simply a negative experience.
phone sex is an alternative to having sex.
decide where you are going to live once you talk to her.
i don't believe that would be at all useful.
she favors dyeing her hair various colors.
your time and your life!
i dont know
enjoy your day
do it for him
in the event its size makes occupying the mouth impossible.
how old are you and your mother?
so how do I go about telling them?
some people are just very ignorant.
does he care about relatable subjects or not?
that is not nice if you do that to your friend.
Pretty, classy, fine... That's the kinda girlfriend you want.
It'll hurt regardless
They don't know how to act because this is new to them.
What are you talking about, you don't know women?
you on instagram or snapchat?
Just brush up close and whisper that you want to kiss her
If it's painful when you have sex then maybe somethings wrong...
Heroin, don't do it, you'll regret it.
I don't care if you luv him, he needs to go - pronto~
Some guys butts look hot in the right pair of jeans.
Trust me, the world don't hav a shortage of gorgeous women.
We know him, v6, me and jj all live near each other and go to the same school as him.
people invent many reasons to explain why they have not found the right person.
it sounds like he needs to mature.
you should let her try a sports' bra on.
i have been nice to her continuously. What else is there to do?
you two broke up so let him take care of it.
This is ur best shot at getting a good answer, for realz.
Gab's got it right, there's no way to know what's up.
LOL. The Muslim question gave me a good laugh.
It was funny watching Spider Man get thrown for a loop over an upside down kiss.
Flip ur thinking so that people don't think ur dumb.
they really love U or they just saying that and givinG no backup
It's all just a bunch of dreams is all
things that get me going: hairy chest and chin
he's blowing u off for the same reasons we blow you off
do i have 2 get over my crush
i accidentally asked her to marry me and she said yes!!!
were they guys?
its not the only things thats true
different men like different things about girls
Let her know you need intimacy every now and then
Try not to project.
Maybe you guys should take a breather for a sec
School is the biz in the 6th grade.
Once u have sex with them. for sure you will love them more.
Guys want true and caring girls that cater to their needs i think, thats it.
we met threw his brother
open up dont hold back.
Be patient, i think is what it needs
That's really helpful even if its not really necessary
I told him yes!!!!
From what I've been hearing it sounds like he's already got a girlfriend
It doesn't matter what you wear. Get dressed up or wear jeans. Either is fine
He's a man whole and you should back off
tell him that it is over, in a nice way.
i would never pack a bag for my husband!
you need to find someone else. And stop stalking them.
avoid being idiotic, as I have seemed.
iunderstand as I have the same problem.
it was disgusting when my girlfriend bit my phallus off then proceeded to eat it.
i wouldn't want my boyfriend to have lunch with another woman especially on Valentine's Day.
obesity is responsible for the second highest amount of deaths in young people.
it will happen again if you find her.
I wish I knew
Do a resort vacation. She will like that
Don't say nothing about it to her
Message me on Yahoo Messenger at pao_sky2000
I went through that 2 years ago
He doesn't think you like him that much, since you only called him twice...
There are so many important things that I think about.
It can't just be about yourself man, you have to make her feel good in the bedroom too.
I know a lot of great guys.
keep looking for that special person and you will find them!
even though it is acceptable, your partner does not need to know everything you think about.
it is more exciting so you're aware, being shy is a hindrance.
i used to do it frequently.
casually place it out there.
There a bunch of liars!
Having sex with a friend can really screw things up for your relationship
Get a girl who likes the same stuff as you
Try it if you really like them
Hey, girls... any advice on having sex for the first time?
no, only if you would like your friend to watch as well.
it is difficult being eight years old, right?
the two of you need a marriage counselor or a larger bed.
Sex is like air and water, can't live without it.
Trust me this can get bad.
They've been in love since they were 10.
They will always talk crap about you behind your back.
Grants never have to be paid back.
the internet is a wrong place.
you will not require special shoes.
you can tell that is just friendship if he will not even sit with you.
if he will not perform oral sex, then don't let him have sexual intercourse with you.
who ended the relationship?
I'd say Adam and Eve, although they were smart.
I'm stunned by how egostistical you are.
It's not hard to make a cake.
No.  This is reality and not a chat room.
Why not do just this one thing?
why not get with her if he loves her??
tell him hes the boss or just leave his ass
get ur butt to a doctor!!
i dunno if they agree but i feel like im not replaceable
if you wanna surprise them, say you love them
He alway's says he's sorry but then a month later he's lying again!!!
When my bae farts and burps he's just like a government mule
Try doing other things that he wouldn't like and that way you'll know if he likes you for you or for what you do
You'll always wonder if you don't tell him the truth
It happened because of fate.
You should love them because God loves everyone, and that should be passed on to others.
You should really think carefully about this before deciding.
It's a moment I'll never forget, it was so strange, I fell right to my knees.
play the selection 'Baby, Baby, Stay Gone,' a song by Jimmy Wayne.
however, I derive pleasure from heavy petting, including even a small amount of stroking.
in the first place, do not do anything unless you want to do it.
i married an attractive, rude man and I later divorced him.
it is only worth it if both of you can wait.
if you do not leave him alone, you might run into some trouble.
Love isn't scary, cuz if it is, it's not love. You haven't met the right guy yet, so keep looking and good luck!
You can date whoever you want and get on with your life.
Your mom kicked out the wrong person.
Ok, don't buy her cheap edible panties if you want the night to be nice.
It's not for you.
do not pressure women as it will not result in a positive response.
yes, but I hope I never have to do so.
we sat on my bed together, and I looked into her eyes before going in for the kiss.
wait. Perhaps it is not yet time for you to meet the right person.
the options are to co-exist peacefully with the individual or to not do so.
Im no prude.  I love watching porn and oral, and I'm also hot as hell
Waves usually don't get that large even with rain
u dont wanna have to see his mug again
no, not in actuality. However, if you become impregnated, your baby may be born deceased or suffer deformities and/or illness upon birth.
showing her should cause fewer fights than hiding things.
do not go on another date with her.
if women are not attracted to you because of it. Is their own problem.
what will I do with the two of them?
was his boss mean to him?
if you look straight into his eyes, you will get an answer.
just like other men, I too like women younger.
if he needs to kill himself to get over this then so be it.
then, he attempted suicide, and my unintelligent self went to see him in the hospital.
p.a. - i'm not coming down on you in any way.
u should make sure not to let sex ruin a good thing.
believe it or not, dues have feelings sometimes too.
all women are different - just like the dudes.
that has different meanings.
yes, if you stop being lazy.
a man is a man.
Lots of dudes are, but not all of them.
Mine are alive!
there must be a reason for her jealousy.
it is very telling that he doesn't like children.
she did it once.
if you are attracted to males and females, you're therefore bisexually oriented.
i enjoy a man with a round posterior, it's attractive.
What gives, if you're not getting hitched.
Say what you want, I like doggie-style.
You think she's hot, then go for it.
start paying him some attention and sho him you care.
i didn;t believe it till i looked into her eyes.
im still with her, we hooked up 9 months ago and we are still going strong.
if your horney then do the deed.
i hope she dont mind that i had a one night stand before.
I'm just saying that the guy didn't do this to you
Having a nice non accusing conversation
I know my boyfriend loves me I hope yours does too
Come visit me in Romania that's where I live now
If you want to get married, then you should do ti
Point is, she's your boss and you had a sexual encounter with her-it is what it is.
He feels bad about it, so i don't think he did.
I realize he's a jerk but he wants to be with me
You wouldnt think bout it if u was her friend!
Shes so lucky, congrats to the bride and groom!!
she aint good enough for you anyway
transmit a video recording of you having sexual relations; it's lucrative.
her appearance would not matter.
i do not think that the chickens care.
she had attempted to use the credit cars, she learned they were not working.
in the event she's romantically inclined, obtain a bouquet and candies, despite the conclusion of Valentine's Day.
do you want people to think you're an idiot?
I need something new and different
you should not have intercourse if you are not aroused, as it will be painful.
no, he merely enjoys conversing with you.
if i were you, i'd wait and see what happens if you think this is going to be heartbreaking....
it cant be love, you dont even KNOW her at all!
totally been there, dude.
how in the world could you do that and then go and tell people allll about it?!
Hope ya find your loved one or a new one and it works out for ya!
Put some clothes on!
if you don't want a kid, make sure he wraps it
Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.
Dust yourself off and get back out there!
Girls also do it.
If a woman looks bad, it's best not to sleep with her.
One day you will find the right person.
When you are in love, you will find some nice meanings.
Did she seriously do that to ya?
You get some money and you tell her you got feelings.
Go ahead, go for it!
haha, my old yahoo chat name was "iscreamifyoudoitright" lmao
what should u do if your bf doesn't call or txt u in 3 weeks?
how my wife makes me pay attention lol
they're not happy, soooo SOMETHING must be missing
ur my most bestest friend EVER!
it depends on your age.
it's simple, find someone in the jail who can marry you.
did did not know that untill now.
accomplish the task once you've become betrothed.
you are still going to feel that you are unable to trust men.
Girls don't talk about it much.
Wanna talk about it?
The times when you can't get 'em out of your head
Don't turn back for that dude.
Stare into her eyes and grin
She means exactly that
Officially Im a gemini, but unofficially i don't believe that bs
Some guys only want you for your box!
Yeah my ex told me the exact thing once.
if all he wanted was to shove his tongue down your throat, he didnt really love you!
you didnt tell me your wife gots kids .
it appears that he has only lukewarm feelings for you.
you can pick someone better.
you will have more temptations rather than being in love.
i do not want to see him again.
perhaps you find a location that is far enough from home, but close enough so your family can visit once a month?
When you can understand each other without even talking.
Is it right to say that a woman knows what I want irl.
You will fuck if you love each other.
You should think about getting a job to send him money.
I cant help but think if it was me.
If the relationship doesnt happen what then?
Be you, but hush up and don't be a ho
I think that is just not right!!!
yeah love can be after 4 months
ive got some get some and figure it out
Is your butt like a chicken's butt?
men are so good at this, there is simply no comparison!
personality first and foremost, then being in shape, finally, kindness.
you can be interested in whoever you want.
just admit that she does not want to date you.
why not just vex every man?
it is alright, now, Yaar.
yes, I believe you should rehome the cat.
that is a good start because you sound attractive.
tto begin, select specifically a single man you're enraptured by.
why man wouldn't date a virgin?
You should really think about it before deciding
you will nevrt be happy with him
it was a MAN
The right thing, u did.
i want a buddy to chat with.
me2, my baby is cross-continental.
act like you don't give a...
My boyfriends tend to be stocky.
you should send your ex a Valentines' Day gift.
when a person is as attractive as you are, it is worth the effort.
you are the only attractive person that I see.
sexual activity with my attractive man (I was not required to provide him to others).
tell him that if he doesn't change your gonna leave and then if he doesn't change leave.
nothing should ever come before you daughter point black
there's someone out there for every one
if I can do it then so can you
ask your bff to do it
any other girls feeling the same???
If he really loves you then he'll wait and don't cheat
you're young kiddo, don't take life too seriously and have fun.
they've got a hard face
yup, hurry up and leave
so long as u are honest and true, love will find u out.
i have to admit that i think about sex all the time and even more than dudes that i know.
go silly or go home - sung as off-key as u can get.
pick up your head and flash those pearly whites.
at the max, around 5 years older than u.
Go to her and tell you that you are the guy she's been waiting for!
There's a bunch more out there than what it seems to be right now.
without regard to whether or not they chuckle on the occasion.
in my head, it did.
all gentlemen are different when it comes to girls; we fall for all types of girls.
it is fine, as long as you have romantic interest in him.
you're developmentally stunted and were you my child, you'd prohibited from socializing with the opposite sex.
I'd help, but nah im lazy lol
the rest is just surface
find someone that treats you the way you deserve
i have been socializing with a very attractive man and our relationship is progressing positively everyday.
i very much love my former lover.
furthmore, avoid the plants that I mentioned.
if she is attracted to you, that would be great.
Are you into someone else, just tell me?
What's wrong with discriminating against someone's sexual orientation?
I don't get how people could be into that, it's so creepy.
If they love you they'll show it.
Until then, quit being a jerk.
Every guy dreams of when she says it doesn't mean anything.
You should also be respectful about it.
Do you think you could be sending a bad message?
Just let it go and get on.
all girls think different bout things i can see that
What went on with his queen?
Depends all on you.
if it matters ands valuable for u, why not try it I guess
i'm uncertain. Are you ready?
would you like to date men or women?
you can go as far as you want to go.
if she asks me, I do not know the answer.
what's the reason for your unemployment?
i  like him alot.
i asked him how he knew that I was looking at you.
would he be bothered if you asked other men for pictures?
it couldn't have been that bad if they wed in spite of it.
i am letting you know that it was very long.
you'll need help, women are harder to get in the mood.
If you feel the need to ask, you aren't ready to get married.
I never agree with my boyfriends mom.
I am addicted to sex, maybe that's wrong, but I love getting freaky.
their favorite thing is to have their paws on your cash.
I was asked to stay overnight at a girls house i know
let them know if they would've asked sooner but you already have plans
Forget what could be and enjoy what is
She won't look at you the same if you dont make her want to impress you.
I can't figure out why I did that in the first place.
I'm not gonna ask him out or anything like that!
My opinion can be dangerous if asked
Ask her if you really want to know the answer
Being crude doesn't make him look good
Ask him if he will have dinner with you.
this is the only sore spot between us
so when you gonna tell me your making this stuff up?
if you don't get asked out by someone you like dont go at all
he probably hates this too.
I’m not quite smart enough for him!
You ever like a girl but not wanna date her?
It would be awful if you broke up after all of that.
You're a total stranger to me.
Get out of there and stay out!
If you are gay you can ask God to forgive then you can still go Heaven, or so they say.
he's my good friend but ONLY a friend.
Learn to spell. I can't understand your ? even.
Don't do anyhting you'll feel sorry for later
most likly hes into someone else wont tell uthou
after i drank and smoke!!!
agree w/im no problem but what r ur thoughts bout it?
go after whatever thick u want
shes always afraid
look for younger men even though some fifty year old men are good looking.
what is the opposite of being above me?
it's not something that males like to do.
why can you not simply ask her on a date?
she simply is my true love even if she is not considered special by others.
have you ever heard of a pajama party?
do you really enjoy hurting people who are so important to you?
my friend often teases me because of my personality.
no, move on with your life. I have been through this before.
a lot of guys dream about the same thing.
it is not a good idea to date everyone.
i have the same problem.
karma will rear its head on him again.
do not let him see you when you are depressed.
but we are very happy, and we enjoy our lives.
date him on a single occasion and, should you have enjoyed the encounter, then, don't be stupid, maintain his company.
Why is it that the more exciting sports have the most contact.
For real, you shouldn’t get him another dog.
If you are having sex with somebody you should love that person.
better to love somebody with some get up and go than to love a loser
asking this question means that you love your wife
if you want to be perceived as a potential girlfriend for someone, you should be genuine.
my breasts are too big for this shirt.
read my Questions and Answers section. I was in a relationship with a friend of my new girlfriend and I broke up with her.
i am merely his friend. I love him, but he seems not to know.
sex feels great and is one of the most important things a man can do in life.
It's going on right under Angelina's nose, right at their pad.  That's crazy right?
Look is a black guy breaks into my place, it's fair to say blacks are criminals
That night, he just find me not hot or something?
Put on some sexy ass outfit, dress to the nines, cook his favorite thing, and then finish off with some freak sex.
women like honesty.
initially, his comment in and of itself merely demonstrates the true extent of his character.
it was at least one a week if he did call.
women attracted to other women is not unique. Some nourish it, while others allow it to fade over time.
if i wasn't then i'd be with a chick.
hey girls, answer me this - have u ever gone out with a dude u didn't know very well?
if u really have the urge, send one to him too.
i'm guessing it makes for quick access.
chicks don't seem to worry about it as much as dudes.
Maybe they're just happy about being together?
I'd give em a toilet brush
Ain't no need to keep playing these childish games
That ain't normal for a guy
I'd probably dump him for that
In my opinion, fake boobs suck.
You've woven a big tangled web...
What's hard to get? The dude wanted to screw you...
Don't let him get away with it!
Was just curious... thanks for the answer!
If neither of you want to have sex then I don't see what the big deal is.
Become rabbits and screw whenever you can
It could happen, why not?
Or do you truly love me?
Seems like you're answering your own question
Flirting isn't about acting dumb, ur thinking of sumthin else.
We only live once, we need to have fun b4 it's too late.
First I comment on their clothing, then I move on from there.
For some reason, he thought I had a good time.
Guys like to act tough, but some are almost as sensitive as girls.
leave her and move on.
if you two are meant to be together, love will find a way.
you should not give him another chance to hurt you.
you can of course, but are you sincere?
women want a challenge. Not a man who they can easily control.
observe his how he acts.
i would not date someone again after we broke up.
it is the Holy Grail.
be careful and use protection.
remember it's your decision. You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
It's not really a bad thing.
Live your life took my time slow your progress
Forgive and forget sparingly.
If a man doesn't care he doesn't care.
Oh man do it doesn't matter if they're married either.
He’s been trying to avoid me.
Divorce WILL negatively affect children.
try to do one good thing a day.
you should look for a person closer to your age
guys never want to be "just friends" with a woman...
got it?
that's on both of y'all
since you are sorry, you should do it.
It's not the size of the ship, it's the motion of the ocean...
i am in my mid-twenties and still inexperienced.
if it's unimportant, then why is she dating another woman?
have some patience and give him a chance to get to know your children.
if they are in love with each other, then they will live together.
yes you can. Did you miss the day they mentioned that in sexual education class?
Believe me, everything that glitters aint gold and people are not always who they seem to be
I want to hug him everytime I see him
You think of him everytime that song comes on
he thinks im lying
dont sweat that, no worries!
Things will get lots better when you get adulted.
He's gonna find another but its like you want something alot more.
If you get stocks and bonds you will become richerer.
From your statement it seems you are just living in fantasy land Dr checko (nickname)
Speak it loud and proud and let come what may.
Stupid is worse than foolish
Skin color shouldn’t be a factor
tell her to wait.
he just wants to be friends
Don't get involved with that drama. Save yourself
make him think you're interested in his best friend
they're getting along better now i think
THIS CANT BE DONE THROUGH EMAIL
IF I GET DUMPED ITS MY FAULT
IF SHE'D PAY ATTENTION SHE'D KNOW
ITS BETTER TO JUST SAY STOP
I'd encourage her to think again.
I don't think so, ya'll girls is scared.
tell him you ain't listening if it ain't your way
When I first hooked up with Matt, I liked Jon but didn't know he liked me too.
Same as why men do it.
Better men will like you if you dress better.
She will know we slept together.
Dumb question, cuz if you don't know, you never will.
sure, u might love him but do u really want to risk him giving u an std?
I'm needing a lot of answers, so let's get on with this
Who cares what his butt looks like if he treats you well
so they don't wanna be ur friend anymor?
They are a substancial part of your life.
A talk might help, some men get weirded out by commitment and marriage.
almost all married men are happy.
tell her her parents love hereven if they dont live with each other
tell her u been there and he gave you vd
start off by saying hi and move into easy talk after that
i asked if he liked me still and he said no
just do what you like doing
No, he doesn't even know her. They met online.
No that's the opposite of normal.
You might make it worse if you try to force it.
If he doesn't like her she needs to just move on.
It's gonna be all bad.
you have somebody with whom to share both your good and your bad moments.
determine whether or not she returns your email missive or discover the result personally.
it is possible that the flowers might be too strong.
you two should have sex frequently.
Sentence: You already know the answer.
if u wait it out, good things will happen.
if your chick loves u, your past should not be a problem.
no problem with this if he joins in and it's 3 together then okay but otherwise no way.
usually it's the one who ain't so good in the sack.
do not attempt to impress her. Simply let her know that you are interested in her.
my virginity was forsaken at 17 years of age; I was genuinely unaware of the reason underlying the excess of hyperbole.
do u have conversations with people in the Yahoo chat rooms?
if you have feelings for his friend instead, you should tell him.
i do not like skinny women.
I don't understand why men feel the need to cheat on their partners.
Just tell me what it is that girls want from guys.
Why are people putting so much at risk just to get laid?
Some people behave in such a depressing way.
If you wait too long, chicks will get leary.
is that you giving u trouble?
AHEM!!!....do yall plan to let me know whats going on in this discussion or NOT?!
Throw a party so she can meet all new folks.
It aint bad if hes 34 and your 25.
you have to remember 'food' and 'sex' if you want to attract your husband's attention and have sex.
you may find a tall beautiful blonde but she will not be smart.
ask a question and you might get the answer.
was it her personality that made you fall in love?
trust me, you will regret it later in life.
talk to him, ur wasting time!!!!
lol the best way to get divorced is to get married
u know what hes up to but u dont do anything about it
u dont know how old he is????
u can fall in love in 4 months i did
simply tell him you respect yourself.
i am interested in a woman who attends the same school as me.
do you have dreams about her when you sleep at night?
talk to a friend if that does not work.
ido not even converse with other men.
Great way to start the day!!!
I would love to have a picnic somewhere quiet and private! It would be beautiful!
Ask questions about where he works, does he work a lot, etc.
we all do it!
Ya, me too. Know what you mean.
If you dont know, ask her.
I want a pure girl as I am also virgin.
don't say too much!
in any case, their personality needs to be something I can tolerate.
Don't worry, when you get older it will make more sense.
it's obvious, theyre sex addictz
Please don't let her die!
You can be someone's puppy dog if you choose to do that.
If you like him, let him know loudly, if you don't, just say no.
Men, men, men, everywhere in the world.
Give it up and look for someone else cuz you guys won't get hitched anyway.
You need to sign one everyday with each other.
you are welcome to join the party, as I believe everyone has the right to enjoy my girlfriend stripping.
don't worry about fickle things.
unless, of course, if was a good dream.
love can lead to heart ache.
why do i have to be of some religion to go to a wedding?????? what?????
heal ur heart find a good dude
u dont need ALLLL the ladys just OOOOONNNNNEEEE
yeah he was all flirty no wonder
Get her phone number.If she doesn't give you it, then she's not into you.
In my opinion, it's a woman being grown up.
Get rid of him, just because you love him, doesn't mean he loves you too.
That's none of your business!
I think for myself, too.
LOL means Laughing out loud
Is it cool for me to smash my girl?
Who knows what will help. Try checkin for girls
if you like 'em, don't let some other woman worm her way in there
scratched his head and said he was just kidding as he threw a banana at the screen
I'd get with her even if she'd just been with him, if you know what I mean
act proper and do what your heart wants
just ask her out for something casual
You can't have a wedding in jail.
You need to say hi.
First, they are just like you, so don't call them dumb and ugly.
My sister means the world to me but she puts herself in dangerous situations with men.
You have to make your trip to Iraq, but keep in touch so I know you're ok.
Find a way to get taller like standing on furniture or just learn to walk on stilts!
No, it is just because he is such a player.
I love you more than anyone else in the world.
most people don't really go there.
has anyone had sex with their spouse before marriage?
there is nothing shameful about sex.
you can surprise him!
your story is similar to a television series.
just like maybe their husbands just aint good enough
oh, i dont think it was any big deal
your love of a person is for who they are, not their race
I quit it and started the REC TEAM, it was way more fun
Thing is women who smell like crap think that they dont
Life is adventure and we are not getting younger.
He looks at other women and lies when I catch him.
You are right, but she will kill me if I do not do it.
Don't get involved in their disputes.
Only if both of you have a Bromance.
what should I do so I do not scare her away?
of course, if you are over the age of eighteen.
socialize with your companions from younger days in order to become acquainted with alternative unmet companions.
people who do not understand it are most likely brainwashed.
it is not very attractive, in my opinion.
all i believe is that I agree with you.
hmm, if you lack the knowledge, I'll not inform you.
i am a man, and I know what actions you should take.
i like the song 'Sex and Candy.'
perhaps she possesses the similar emotions that you possess.
To me, I feel like he don't trust you.
Sorry to say no but, go get a job.
No need to get married... just be some ones bed buddy.
Looking for advice? Don't do it!
Just be tru to urself and dont let him try to use u
I know it sounds weird but try watch a gay porno and a straight one!
If a woman can marry a dolphin, nothing's impossible!
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be....just be yourself and be honest and confident!
I like it when guys hit on me... It makes me feel so confident
Act polite because you aren't right now.
He can't stop cheating.
I would never have my gf wait.
He loves me and never cheated and wouldn't.
I tell my bf that I'm super into him all the time.
want to come check out the cock pit?
the best is when the girl is on top and the lights are on!
well, she she might have dumped you because you're a jerk
I cannot even believe he's talking to you right now
the most important thing is to have fun!
THEY AIN'T PLAYING SEXUAL GAMES
I can't get enough sex, I love it.
I LIKE TALKING TO HIM AND DON'T FEEL GOOD UNLESS I DO
WE A BIT SPECIAL AROUND HERE
That's most awesom... Still alot way to go..
there's some one better out there. GO GET HIM GIRLL let em hear you ROARRRRRR!!!!!!!!
Give the men some mystery to ya but not a whole lot.
she's my wife i'm speachless :) :)
as long as you're with a responsibile person you're fine
you'll get married when you're ready
write him a note
it doesn't matter how old you are. Just run
You should tell him about the call.
It works for me to be honest.
He wasn't thinking about how you feel.
You'll get over him. Time will heal all.
I've taken the plunge 3 times and have 2 kids
He's marrying a chick, right?
Ask nicely why she hadn't called for so long
The girls you chill with aren't good for you
What can you do if he's really cute?
She'll think you're hiding something if you don't tell her.
That's a lie because if you are really in love then it doesn't matter what happens.
Or you could just spread rumors about her everywhere.
Shame on you, she's done it again.
you're doing the right thing, divorce him and move on with your life
Go ask her out!
We have 3 small kids so i cant play with him long.
They shouldnt be around babies, they have diseases
Everyone has something they dont like about thier appearance
you are not asking anything.
life is great, that is the answer!
if there is nothing better to do.
where do you live?
maybe he doesn't want to have a conversation with you.
Young friends are the fountain of youth
Give it to her at dinner
a boy friend that is his friend too.
tell him that your baby really needs him.
you get what you pay for in this life.
but they still want to have sex with you.
Everyone is attracted to other people so don't worry.
My grammie tells the story way better!
Yep, men fantasizes about sex more than girls do.
Just be honest, you are all thinking about it.
Just wait and see how things shake out.
Unfortunately, thing don't get better at the end.
What do you wanna do now?
People don't give a crap about others.
Man up and go to the wedding!
my bestie is a guy and we never did more

what are you waiting for? Pursue him!
play with his friend.
do you perspire much?
tell him to come his eyes to make you comfortable.
If he is so con conceited, he isn't worth your love.
You gotta talk to him and tell him to stop.
Why would you ask a dumb question
your 3yr old already has a dad.
19 but almost 20.. how old r u?
Hey, a girl should like you for who you are.
you wanna find more of these people? then go to henderson north carolina
well, if you're doing other stuff with the guy anyway,you might as well have sex with him too.
we can't read your mind, u know.
some individuals necessitate some motivation.
if that doesn't work, then I don't have any other answers.
it saddens me to say this, but she was unfaithful to you when you were still in a relationship.
if shes into the beaches think about going to the Bahamas some weeknd

dont inflict pain on yourself
youll never be able to match a womans style, so dont buy her clothes unless SHE picks it
no hurry just wait and be chill
you take it slow and try to make it as close to perfect as possible.
don't play games, you won't be successful.
you will get pleasure form it.
jon and I used to be close, and talk frequently.
she might be honest with you and let you know that she really does not want to be with you anymore.
Let your folks know you love 'em and keep on living!
Sorry to say, but I have no idea where he could be.
Pooches are just like members of the fam ... take it from me, I'm in the know.
How do I help her along in losing weight?
They've got a bunch of terrific ideas in that place.
do notmlet anyone tell you anything different.
yes, the buttocks of a man are important in whether or not he is attractive.
a simple method for communicating his desire for a mere rendezvous.
i couldn't ever hurt anyone I care for.
i think it is mixed.
Some man might ask why all girls are slutty.
don't run, and tell him to slow down.
So if that's true, what should I do for her?
I get it. I already said that.
He still wouldn't care if he knew it.
When you are on the cruise, push her over the rail.
It how you do when, when you're in it
Another mans trash is another persons treasure
Chances are, I will never find him.
My home boy says she is playing you.

I really get off on dated bisexual women
You better give your man some space, they don't like feeling possessed.
Yo, I like women from Italy

Keep your head up and never give up, even if things don't go your way.
Caring is listening if he talks about it
People R DUMB!!!!
just going to be friendly about it
Yikes huge problems to be with a chick in jr high!
you're incorrect concerning that selection. Personal concerns, yes?
my advise for you is don't go out with a stranger.
the chances are slim.
if you are ok with it, do not second guess it.
This could be so much worse.
It should be acceptable as long as you think its fine.
Even if he is volunteering to do it, he still needs to be questioned and watched carefully.
A real man isn't afraid of 'Love'.
We didn't really have a choice but to go our separate ways but I do love him still.
Follow your instincts, they may seem wrong but they'll lead you to the right place.
Having sex with a man with a small dick was awful!
What made you like doing it?
If we were looking for fun we hit certain hot spots at night.
I have heard that sometimes it happens where friendships lead to something more romantic.
I know all about boys, if you have questions.
I love phone sex with my boo
You gotta learn how to read between the lines, know what I mean?
Buy something that he would like to see on you.
you drew them in with your affection.
i would just like to be his friend.
i hope things work themselves out.
lots of men dont like to be bossed arounf
he shouldnt b putting you down dont let it get to u life is just too short to be affected by stupid boys
my partners eyes yes i am
You both know way too much about each other already.
I can't tell you why, but I was into a chick like that before.
You could just act like he's dead to you.
Don't even think about forgiving him!
Your are dangerous and don't even know it.
Look him in the eyes that is all you need.
I like a good kisser and good sex.
You have no idea about what you want in life.
it's dependent upon yourself. However, is it something you'd desire to have happen?
if the man is going to marry the woman, she must have not had intercourse with too many other men.
it must be an element contained in the water!
what type of friend are you searching for?
no, maybe he would like to speak to you before he goes to sleep.
Its like the only thing that is more important than health for people
Youre totally getting used by them
Once you bang him, he'll be wrapped around your finger
Just banging someone is meaningless, but actually being with somone you love means something
Its totally true, and I do the same thing at times
because some men forget themselves when they are in the presence of attractive women such as myself.
that is one of the main topics, when women get together.
perhaps you're interested in bad boys?
you can do better, most likely.
whenever you see her, have her view the best of you.
personally want my daughter to be gay, know how men are
not worth ur time and thoughts
how to tell him im prego and not have him flipp out
step one kissing, then the rest
It just depends on her.  I lie all the time and everyone believes me.
The embarrasement level shouldn't be concerning.
your nose + her privates!!
This lady's jerk of a husband was abusing her kids!!!
If he gets you that upset it's time to move on.
If he understands, stay.
U might want to stay his friend.
I have no clue who you met.
How'd u feel if ur future hubby cheated on u?
ur smiles don't cost anything.
some person will find you if not
Your gonna have to live with it even if you say sorry because he's not gonna come back.
Your related to my spouse so im just like your friend.
they think their's hope cause their in love.
I aint on the list.
If you know you can trust your man, no worries.
I cant think of ANY reasons.
Even if a guy is over 250 that can still be hot and chill.
Should I go back to that place or just stay home?
WHY ARE YOU WITH THIS GUY????
i gained 2 pounds or so said my scale
Just one way you can find love!
What I want is someone married so I can have fun with no strings.
I'm 28 and still out there looking.
you only marry if you want to spend the rest of your life with this man!
there is a chance of a small part of her that does not, but most likely she does.
that is impressive and we ought to thank him every day for the wonderful feelings of arousal.
it depends on whether or not you believe in books on dream meanings, I suppose.
I got a great idea you can move to new zealand.
i'll enjoy the candy & roses... but what will u be doing then?
i didnt even know what that word meant!? my freind had to tell me.
he hasnt been with ANYONE seriously for a LONG time.
HOW DID I EVER WASTE SO MANY YEARS WITH SCUMBAG LIKE YOU!!!!
If she ain't their supervior, it's all good
Some people just crazy out there.
I can't wait to do the same to her
If someone isn't asked out, do they become unattractive.
Marriage ain't no joke
Obviously he doesn't accept who you are, don't stay with him and be miserable because of it.
Do your sexy dance for him.
I want to do things to you that I wouldn't even do to chocolate cake.
Would anyone lie about being 38?
Don't hide, you might loose them!
give it some time, it has only been six months.
do not have children if you want to participate in coitus for more than five minutes.
he would not have cheated if he did it.
most likely, she still lives with her parents.
why, does it matter to you?
U can't help greaming, frantisizing, it's only that.
and it makes some people jealous, so b careful bout that.
I'd never post that kind of personal info.
You can't worry about pleasing others, just yourself.
your insticts are always the best sign if you are doubting him.
am I to believe he doesn't have a legitimate reason to dislike you?
iam curious now, too, so what was that about?
has that happened to you before?
in the event this young man is fond of you, you'd be best to accompany him.
tell him u like him thru ur friend
not over yet nope
youve got to be smart about it
get even by being a better person than before w/them
omg dont go up to him and tell him you want to have his sis- no!!!!
If you act like a woman, you might get lucky.
My husband and I hooked up when I was 19. That was almost 7 years ago.
You have to hang with him for a while to see what he's all about.
its always great in the beginning but eventually the magic wears off
I'm busy and can't talk right now
they can't stay away from each other long
give her a phone card or a vday card?
ask him what he wants to do with his life
$ = all
get to kno her
sometimes you don't realize you like someone until they express interest so its worth a try
im pretty sure shes into me becaue all of our flirting and that we talk constantly
I dont wanna bug anyone
Just hooking up with someonen doesn't mean you have to date them
it depends on the man because it is not all guy.
a sense of humor is important.
please repeat after me. You are a dishonest jerk.
do it in public.
tell him that you love him.
it is human nature to want to be loved.
once you move on, then you will not mind whether he moves on or not.
because pain is akin to pleasure, and when one bleeds, one experience a feeling similar to sexual release.
Just come out and tell them...that's the best way to do it.
May you be preserved by god and your fellow soldiers
You know what need to be done...you gotta forgive em.
Once a cheater, always a cheater!
tell the awful woman that you hate her and she needs to back off.
i only care about what type of person she is now.
realize that mother and father are happy being separated.
incorrect, however your beauty appears greater to him after sundown due to your father being asleep, lol.
sometimes it is very unfortunate, but it will happen when it is meant to happen.
want to get hitched to me?
this is a problem i have had many times, just keep them both happy and stick with them.
it he wants to be friends, then thats it.
You are usually happy and glowing
marriage is better, but its not easy either.
men of a certain nature love to listen to them.
she will probably catch on if you kiss her on her cheek, and she may carry on from there!
if hse ignors you, she is not worth your time.
if you love someone then you sacrifice being with anyone else.
do not center your life around her.
what is her favorite restuarant?
now you receive two of everything.
i don't agree that woman should approach first.
go take a bath and relax
Dont' worry about being serious right now.
i wouldn't worry about it i cant believe he even told you he's dumb lol
if you are truly in love, you should not want anything other than that.
in the event my husband were unfaithful, I'd most likely sever his genitals and display them upon the rear-facing mirror of my Mustang vehicle.
love is a weird thing for guys.
refrain from corrupting your spiritual security for anybody.
i have a significant amount of excitement to live for.
open it, and ask her.
inform him that you maintain your feelings in love for them using any possible method.
make it appear as though you are interested in her in another way.
bf is all up into watching chicks while drivin he thinks i dont see it
just treat him like a friend u havent seen in forever
would you do it with more than one person at the same time????
dude is leading u OOOOOONNNNN
in the event I genuinely give it some consideration, I want a relationship with the pair of them, I imagine.
please dream of me, then date me.
what do you find attractive in a woman's looks or words?
The feeling of like goes both ways between me and him
Although, I waz crazy about this guy,when he embarrassed me in front of a ton of people, i am not sure how i feel.
Kick him to the curb, it might wake him up.
If it feels right, then it is okay
Hey, did i tell you lately, that I am sweet on you?
How do I go on without him, I care so much!!!
I really rather be able to talk to someone.
Shit, its a roller coaster.
If you want to be her side piece then it would be fine.
Cover it up, or you will get knocked up.
Maybe you just need to be alone with a man
Is it far away?
If you're both naked and in bed, it's gonna end up being sex together.
if you truly like him, you will simply know.
stop trying to control her life.
my man tells me it gives him the opportunity to tell me that I am attractive.
you should stop and think about how that makes you look in front of his friends.
it does not matter who she was, even if it was a stripper.
maybe they should get married now.
you’re man isn’t really you’re man.
I LOVE only having myself to think about!!
What's up?
don't let no man find out, they be hatin'
tell him everything related.
Just b careful if he's the sort of asshole who can't understand.
yeah, the sense of humor is necessary, and confidence, and kidness.
I won't want 2b the 7th man  if she starts to think about number 8.
He's sweet, but is terrible at thinking right.
Pick me, but be specific about the category or stereo type. How old is important too!
Why does she just want to watch?
I don't like hurting other people.
Because for her taking it out when times are tough and it's difficult
I've been datin my bf over a year and he still lies all the time.
You think you did it on purpose?
If we were lying you'd know it. Trust us.
You should ask her why she's staying in that relationship if she feels that way about you
They just like to MAKE YOU HURT
To answer your question, men are from Mars so you can't make any sense of them
I love love love my baby daddy <3<3<3
It seems you've already decided to have sex with him
i wish they would treat us with respect.
of course that made me extremely angry.
are you suppose to sign that?
it is a narrow way of thinking that God does not care about sexual proclivities.
A simple little wedding in the yard worked for me.
I'm glad I married him, but people are freaking out about it.
Even though your heart wants it, if your gut says to get out, do it.
Somebody who cheated once will do it again.
You need to wait until you hear her side of the story.
Maybe he thinks it's your fault you have a kid.
No offense to the good guys.
I luv her.
I'm not sure about that.
Don't tell your girl to be a stripper.
my bff went out w a really short dude and they even made out.
he’s not cheatin if he says he is.
She luvs u like a brotha
Why would I go thru his stuff if I did?
He's not lonely at all.
No that means you are the one I want.
Get rid of him and end it.
I heard a coat vaccuum will do the job.
Dump him and don't listen to his garbage excuses. He doesn't love you
You just can't see beyond her looks, can you??
If you don't call him now, he might disappear forevah.
It's fun to be a little naughty sometimes, can't be good all the time.
Hello??!! We have hormones too nitwit!
Unless you have soem hidden doubts - the answer is no.
honey, I love you with all my heart.
there are better things you an do with your life then try to understand men.
you need to relax for awhile.
sometimes I travel back to my hometown to get away. My hometown is located across the country from where he is.
be sexually intimate before you go to sleep.
say yes if you are interested in him and no if you are not.
if I had to choose, I would choose African American, because Caucasian men just do not attract me.
that depends on whether he prefer war games, sports games, et cetera.
i no longer want to be in a relationship with him.
they are loved because if they were not then they would not find it.
The coaches were way cool to let me stay in more than half the game.
They think differently than you do.
It can make your relationship wayyyy better.
Keep at it until you get to level 4.
Hit me up cuz I speak the idiots, grunts and jabberwockys languages.
You can go to UK and see what the answer is.
Most girls don't like him lol on campus.
Guys like to look at our boobs.
If you dump your girlfriend she will be so surprised.
Speak up and don't be shy.
you can give her a nice gift, and ask her then.
how can I respond if I do not know your gender?
do not worry and be mean about it because love is not rare.
she should make a decision, so she can prevent getting pregnant.
you better get rid of that cheater
start at the first moment of you wedding
i don't discriminate when it comes to the gender of my friends
no need for shades you future is not bright
it's time to have a convo if you don't think they're ready to commit
I love wearing heels so a guy I date will have to deal with it.
It may break his heart to realize you don't love him but he will be ok.
You knew he was not a talked when you got married so why expect him to talk now.
It is online everywhere I look.
do not sleep together if you have not already.
what kind of father does that make him?
spend time with a man who has some rough edges.
the problem is, I am not sure if she feels the same for me.
i do not like emotionally weak people, though.
she loves you like a brother.
Bad teen movies is the only place that works.
He would never leave his wife for her.
If you need to just stay with your sister.
going w/a friend has always worked out for me
think hes into me or playing me?
that language is horrible
how to reject someone & still be friends?
I like to spoon, other's don't
Shut the door when she came over.
Fun and romantic kinda love
have u seen the movie the game?
dont say i love you too early on
i would like to be done with work.
it takes time to remember the good times and forget the bad.
i saw them last year, and they were very good.
she is not even in college yet and the two of you would like to have a serious relationship?
you could e-mail him if you cannot do that.
you begin to want her more if you think about her more often.
i occasionally think only about coitus.
it ought to be elaborate, public, and demonstrate her importance to you. You should attempt it.
that will make it worse.
mybe you thought there was more love then there was when you got married.
If that person hurst you, you will have another to be there for you.
Tell her to try asking him to hang out with her or something.
He is hooking up with some whore.
If she isn't faithful, let her go because she ain't worth it.
If you like him, you should hook up with him.
she cannot hinder you from visiting with your child.
nno man would bribe you to kill your child.
u should stop calling and see if he misses you.
rreprimand your daughter for her bad behavior.
it may have been communicated in the same manner as you informed us.
if I did not have children, I would die for the one I love.
why do so many men want to live with Asian women?
help me answer the question what needs to be done.
go out with one of her closest friends, and treat her like a queen.
tell her to not date bad guys.
a lot of my friends gfs ask me the same thing
im trying to figure it out
kiss him and see how u feel
my bf loves my toes
You need to do it now who knows when you’ll see him again
This guys recommends to take it slowly
Do you even hear yourself right now?
u need to let him know what u want to lead him along.
u mean he can't convince a chick to share hers with him?
u lose interest quick like when u are with either of them.
u know what u need to do.
My magical toy says it is so.
One day I just sat him down and told him how I felt about him.
She wanted to know how I was feeling.
It really just depends on how long you've been dating.
If you had known, you would have tried to be just that.
You’re in soooo much trouble.
She’ll do it when she feels like it.
it should be OK.
It’ll take forever just to pick out the dresses!!!
things started to change later that month.
tt is not okay and just because he is male does not make it right.
i would choose Jamookae. He has serious mental problems.
I will try to kiss her next time.
I want to put in my 2 cents.
I'm not them.
I don't understand why anyone would kill a baby.
She's really not attracted to you like that.
Just chill out and let her know you are into her.
If they don't seek you out, it just wasn't meant to be.
Step 2: Do this if you don't see results after 3 weeks
In most cases, he's uncomfortable in the outfits you like.
However, I'm not the one who did anything wrong -- I love him so much, what should I do?
Remember, just cause he knows ur involved don't mean he wont try.
Roses are red violets are blue.
Do what u gotta do- it's not wrong.
Maybe his wife doesn't seduce him like before.
I care, but it's not everything.
Don't worry bout it, he'll understand.
Runaway and merry that person you cant live without.
Theres plenty of fish in the sea, just forget about that person and find someone new.
to feel something you hafta take the hole bottle.
if one did not enjoy using intimate toys, than apparently it did not help them.
apologies, it's will remain forever uncomfortable and somewhat oddball-ish.
how do I get it to come out?
I would help if I knew her.
Not just honest, but honorable too. I don't cheat or pretend to care.
I like my teachers, but I'm not one.
I had boyfriends even though I wear glasses.
if I met the woman for whom I have been searching, then she would be all I need.
that was after I caught him cheating.
do not make yourself seem cheep. Married men are not avaliable!
i enjoy dreaming of different men, which I suppose is acceptable.
Spring it on him in private.
Thirty is young to be so fat.
Get out now n be free. No wishy-washy.
You are wet behind the ears.Wait until you are older.
You been had. He's a user.
If they're not at the pet stores are definitely at the barns.
If you have somebody else already then let him go so he can get somebody to.
If I knew I'd be right there.
I don't think we know each other well enough to be in love
It's too late you blew it with her
i think she preoccupied and won't notice if someone else likes her.
so, you say that you are attracted to a lesbian but you are not a lesbian yourself. That does not make any sense.
i will talk to you later about this.
show him what you like, instead of telling him.
mosy guys would liek a chance if you are not married.
