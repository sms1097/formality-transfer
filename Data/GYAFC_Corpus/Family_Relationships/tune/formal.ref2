In the event your age is below 18 years, you are saddled with an enormous difficulty.
Perhaps that's simply his identity.
I adore sexual intercourse, as well, and am unable to become satiated.
Date him on a single occasion and, should you have enjoyed the encounter, then, don't be stupid, maintain his company.
Politely ask why you haven't heard from her for some time.
First - get divorced, second - prove her true character, and then you're finished.
Their favorite position is your money in their hands.
It isn't wrong, just do what you have to.
If you would like to, you can have intercourse.
She thinks of you as no more than a friend.
Yes, it is the French that everyone was using, but this works as well.
But remember that dating does not have to mean being boyfriend and girlfriend.
Everyone wants a "perfect" person but no one seems to be willing to be one.
Just act as if she if one of your friends.
If he says, "Good-bye," to you, then it was not meant to be.
Women do not care as much about it as men do.
I am with this other girl.  I have already met her parents and they really like me.
I would be with you if I knew.
Talk to him. Do not waste time.
If being apart makes them happy, then you should be happy for them.
What would be a good gift for a girl that I like?
You will get asked out.
Do not do somethign that you will regret later.
He is giving you bad advice.
Do not fall for it again.
No, I do not think that anything happened, it was not a real-life situation.
Well, that too, in the same house, where he is living right now, ubder Angelina's nose, cool right?!
Sounds a little but suspicious to me, do you think that she has something to hide.
Wear a sexy outfit, and then get yourself all dolled up for him, and make his favorite dinner, then end the night with some kinky sex!
On occasion, you're unable to travel to your birthplace once and for all.
Just make sure that you are not going overboard with it.
It is certainly oxygen, as you cannot live without oxygen.
Girls, have you ever gone out with a guy that you really liked, but did not really know?
Take some time to learn to use oxygen, if you do not know how to already.
That would depend if you are a guy or a girl.
You are strong, and that will make him weak.
Make her believe that you do not think about her at all.
If you are already having intercourse with the man, then the best thing to do is have more.
I can lend you a few.
Start by kissing, then gradually become more passionate.
Both of you need freedom from the relationship to receive closure and continue forward.
You should tell her how you feel.
I would only get upset if I found the man unattractive.
Why does she want to take a glance?
We are terrible liars, men are better liars.
People have eloped in jail.
Think of how they are feeling.
They will always be that way!
I have a labrador and love him a lot!
Dreams do not mean it is going to happen.
What an eye opener that was for me.
It is not true. She lies about boys liking her.
You do not have to ask her to be your girlfriend.
she cares for you like a brother.
I want only one.
Keep searching for that special someone.
Is it a long distance?
That's how I envision it.
They have to be in the mood for love.
Don't worry about fickle things.
What about trusting people when things get tough.
You should have someone else tell him for you.
Roses are red, and violets are blue.
If you like him, say yes, if you do not, say no.
We have hormones, also.
Do you understand?
We are both 15 years old.  I am a it low on funds.  He likes chocolates, yet are not chocolates too platitudinous?
If you do not know, then I will not tell you.
Sounds like he might have found another way to please himself.
If it hurts, then it is too long.
Be yourself and just see what happens.
That poppycock. Perhaps you simply have personal issues concerning Asian females.
The meaning is she is fond of you in a brotherly fashion.
Is what you're referring to the concept of time or the longitudinal reading?
No, not in actuality. However, if you become impregnated, your baby may be born deceased or suffer deformities and/or illness upon birth.
Of course, it is the feelings that matter.
Do not give him want he wants so easily, because it will give him too much control faster than what you want.
I prefer a man who is not afraid to show that he is sensitive on the inside.
I had the pleasure of reading what you received, but thank you for the information.
I married the sister of my high school sweetheart.
Your partner should be your best friend.
If there is no commitment, you two should talk first.
I do not have her wait for me.
Please dream of me, then date me.
Do not have sex with him for awhile.
Do not go out with her again.
If he wants a break you are either boring, or he is having sex with someone else.
Find someone who wants their future with you.
This wedding is not about you.
Hope this answer helps you.
I want to get back with him.
At that point, determine if he desires to continue being together.
Well, in this situation, I'm similar to your female friend, you're akin to my spouse!
What's the reason you're not willing to let nonsense increase?
Well, give it a second thought. Your desire is not to endanger a quality relationship!
To the extent that females lacking a G-spot are able to experience sex that's agreeable.
Is he not a good person?
I have learned things on here that I did not know about before.
You have to protect yourself, and keep yourself covered.
I am outside your window.
Why would you ask me that question?
I am curious if any women have advice about having intercourse for the first time.
Listen to your intellect and emotions.
Perhaps because you are older than you say. You gave me a negative answer, so here is yours.
Online conversation invitations are dangerous. Meet people in reality.
You have to ask.
Can you help me find something unique and not too expensive?
You do not have to pay state and federal grants back.
I am in my mid-20s and I am still a virgin.
Did did not know that untill now.
Because men are so great at it that we do not compare.
Most men try to act ignorant around the women they are attracted to.
It means that they love you, and want you back.
Only girls must reply to this question, please!
I agree with Exclusive. You should pull yourself together!
Sexual intercourse is sexual intercourse, and is no big deal.
Only if she is twice your age.
You do not. What are you doing, asking a question like that?
Unless they want it just as much as you do.
If you feel that he is, then chances are he is.
Come to Henderson, North Carolina as there are enough of them here.
Try the planet Earth as I hear there are a lot of girls there!
First get soaked in the rain and then ask your man to carry you so you can get cozy.
Ask him where he sees his life going.
Try Wall Street, as in stocks, etc.
You never have to ask. Look him in the eye, see through to his thoughts and you will know.
Touching is very important. It does not have the same limitations as languages and it carries enough warmth to make a person happier.
Then Jon inquired if I would become jealous if spent time with another woman named Alyssa.
How could I be paid by using a service available on the internet?
It will hinder your ability to do amusing things with people.
Do not fear, you will most likely mature and think differently.
Why is he your boyfriend?
It depends on the size of his penis.
I want to try and spice things up.
Yes, if I was trying to get out of the relationship.
You need to be loyal, nice, friendly, and sweet.
Your story could be in a television series.
Who could I possibly answer if I do not even know if you are a male or a female.
We all control our own lives, but, unfortunately, we do not practice that enough, we search outward for the answers.
Attempt at raising yourself as he is not obliged to feed you.
And then, if you have not already, have a doctor examine you.
He will get jealous and when he does inform him that you feel the same way.
We can discuss this situation later.
It is interesting that you like this girl.
It is important so they know how many quests to expect.
What does that mean?
Then do not go back for him.
It did in my thoughts.
I do not know how I will stop caring about him.
That is only effective in bad teenager movies.
Who is more important to you?
You are answering your own question.
Do not do it during your period.
If he will not sit with you, then that is just friendship.
We have hat a lot of in and outs.
I feel like we have so much time together, to break up now would be stupid.
How can I stop being a jealous girlfriend?
What goes on in a mans head?
I need your help with this and I guess you need a guys perspective?
If you have to ask, then you already know the answer.
Would you date a girl who takes off her clothes while dancing for a living?
You will see it is much better.
If you send a video of yourself having sex, you can get paid for it.
Why not tell her the  truth?
You can go as far as you want to go.
If you live near me, I will take you on a date.
He is not interested.
Invite him to spend time with you and then make advances and observe how he responds.
I need many answers so please attempt this.
Sex with my sexy man (and I did not have to share him).
I would say that you are the one and only.
I say no way unless your best friend is suggesting this to you.
If you do not live in the Miami area you should get here fast because this is the best place.
Tell her how much you love her.
I became close with this guy.
Are you sending the wrong message?
Just don't say you are a virgin.
I love not having to worry about any body.
I don't like big boobs.
That is interesting. I still have a long way to go, but thank you for these two points.
Honesty is one of the things which contributes to love.
When he knows that I am not looking, he will stare at a woman and examine her.
I would probably break up with him.
Women want a challenge. Not a man who they can easily control.
It is because no one has done it to them, so they do not know how it feels.
We are better liars than men.
Are there men who you like but you do not date?
If you are not hiding information, then showing her should cause fewer fights than not showing her.
My problem is that I always see others the way I want to see them.
Go on many dates with different men in order to forget him.
"I know he is rude, but he says he wants to be with me."
Leave him, you're wasting your time if you stay with him.
If a person won't be honest with you, then you should just forget them.
It will remain a mystery to everyone.
I promise to not bring my friends along with me.
She knew I was present and in love with her.
If you approach slowly, her body language will tell you what you need to know.
It does not mean he does not love you.
I have a crush on a man and I know that he likes me too.
Yes, the dark hair and eyes and skin; and they are said to have nice bottoms also.
Either he is extremely busy or he is not a good man.
Spend some time with him on a few occasions and discover what he is like.
The waves in Boracay do not typically get that large even though it is raining.
They are merely dreams, you must know.
And will I always have to struggle to meet my needs?
Proceed slowly and attempt to make it perfectly.
Because their thinking is not clear.
No, I know Jim, he is.
Don't you just love it when a man acts like that!
A dinner date on a cruise ship, amazing!
If you really like him and want to spend your life with him, then don't have sex just because you are aroused.
If that does not work then talk to a friend. Not about him though!
Do you have a picture page or something?
Honestly, I like men that have not been with a lot of other women.
Are are an awful person.
They are not playing sexual games.
It was a different time, with different ladies.
That depends on your relationship.
If you love them, they will love you back.
I think he will cheat on you some time.
Trust me, I know relationships.
I still think about him.
Pretend he is not there.
No, but who is truly happy, anyway?
It is easy to say yes, but I have a feeling it would be tough to do.
You do not need to worry about that.
There is no way that is the issue.
I would be suspicious of him being unfaithful.
Girls do not like it when a guy is a show-off.
I realize that my mom and dad are happy being apart.
How do I get it to come out?
Love is a weird thing for guys.
Whatever, he is a dolt anyway.
If it does not mean anything, then why is she going out with another girl?
You can do this, but please do not do it, you deserve more.
Asian women are similar to wiser, more mature women.
Let her know that it bothers you.  If she does not stop, run!
I will say wait until she is ready to wear a bra.
I prefer a friend to whom I can talk to.
You need to make him believe you have interest in his best friend.
You should send your ex a Valentines' Day gift.
It is not over until the fat lady sings.
Click on my avatar and examine my questions. They are nearly identical.
Do not say that because most men are not of low intelligence.
You are causing me to feel as if I had just taken two Benadryl.
And does it make any difference if you are shy?
If I were rejected for it, I would deserve it.
That does not mean he doesn't care for you!
Most people who kiss badly do so because they don't truly know themselves.
No, you need to move on. I have been in your shoes before.
Always trust your instincts. Do you still doubt him?
Dark hair, dark eyes, and olive skin.
If he is attractive and you really like him I would, but that is just my opinion and for you to decide.
I only care about what type of person she is now.
It is too much risk if you are asking for my opinion.
When the pain from the love consumes something or someone perhaps.
Just contact me and we will talk about this one.
Guaranteed that there is someone likes her and she is missing it because she is obsessed with the other guy.
I am not sure where it is.  If you find it, let me know, because I really want it back.
They do not want to be your friend any longer?
Dear, it is not a good idea until when and if you get the perfect partner.
Did you ask him what lead him to cheat?
That is too much skin for my taste!
Even now, all of their stuff is untrue.
Then distract her and leave!
Invite him for dinner or a movie!
Love them because God gave you love first.
You can learn from this.
That is the same reason most women dolts.
Learn how to spell so I can understand what you're asking.
Find someone that you deserve.
You need to be careful.
What matters is how long and how thick.
Try a card, and if you cannot, simply say "I love you."
...Or something he would like to see you wear. Then, go back to the store and buy it.
Do not force it. You may make a mistake if you do.
Why would she miss someone, who was not hers to begin with?
My breasts are too big, so no.
I notice it often online. I was merely wondering.
It is not very attractive, in my opinion.
Discuss this before you make a worse mistake.
Approach her and tell her that you are the man for whom she has been waiting all her life.
How old are you? Also, I would like to be your friend.
Yes, get out of there quickly.
They do not think the way that you do.
Just move on with your life and find someone else to love.
i think that you have a boyfriend.
the one that I had with your mother.
Do any other females feel the same way?
Do you mean, how many minutes into the first date?
I am intersted in him, however, I do not know that he is intersted in me.
At times is does not matter how you use it.
What type of friend are you searching for?
How much do you testes perspire?
Lately he avoids me and will not talk to me.
Dance for him in something seductive.
I admire young women with pleasant demeanors.
I appreciate school instructors. However, I am not employed as such.
He acts like he still does.
It depends how far you would let me go.
He obviously is trying to hit on another girl.
And have a joyous happy Valentines day!
I am always happy waking up this morning, I am at work now.
Have I told you lately that you are beautiful? !
Just keep your head held high, and do not give up hope of things are not working out in your favor!y
There are some good country mannered men out there that would love to have a good ol' country girl!
Ask her out on a casual date.
Do not encourage your girlfriend to become a stripper.
That description certainly screams flirting!
Yes my boyfriend is crazy about my toes!
If you love someone then you sacrifice being with anyone else.
Good luck, and have a good day!
I had intercourse with a man who worked very hard.
Do you think that he is interested in me or is just playing games?
You love someone for who they are, not for the color of their skin.
There is not supposed to be any false love, so I suppose "true love" is merely a euphemism.
If you only want your ex, then leave the rest of them alone.
There is no need to keep playing immature games.
You are probably so very unattractive,  that he has no choice but to look.
Just go and talk to her and ask her out for a bite to eat or something like that.
If she likes you as a person, then great.
Come on, yes, it is okay now.
Ask if they would like to hang out.
Do not insult them because they like you.
Maybe he thinks it is your fault you have a child.
I think that might be too soon to tell for certain.
There must be a reason for her jealousy.
I suggest showing him what this is like, firsthand.
Seek me out if you'd like to have fun!
He has to see you as beautiful at night too.
I am sure you are beautiful as well, don't be jealous just have fun.
Don't listen to those girls.
This question was hilarious.
You are a sad person.
You can ask him why.
What is it was a guy?
It is not going to last, so go out and have fun.
Do not ask him out. Make him ask you out.
Perhaps because you are different from everyone else.
The best way is to look him in the eye. Then you will receive the answer.
Besides, do we really want our mothers to be liars?
Tell him in a form which he would appreciate (we all have a way). Discover what his is and use it.
Do you truly want to spend the rest of your life with someone who behaves that way?
Every time I talk about it, he says that I am being overbearing.
I would believe that he is having intercourse with someone else.
I occasionally return to my hometown in order to be away from him.
Remember that this man also needs to help pay your expenses.
Simply laugh out loud and you should feel better.
He is a man, what do you expect?
It could be. It sounds as though he enjoys being around you. You never know.
Why does race matter?
Stop doting on yourself and attend the wedding.
My e-mail address is jakb6hsm@yahoo.com. I like new friends.
If an African American breaks into my house, then is it fair to say most African Americans are criminals?
Do not be a weak, cowardly degenerate.
I like for the woman to be loud, though.
If he has money and is not strange, then remain.
Be unfaithful towards you, then write a note.
If you ask him, he will most likely be honest.
Enjoy your life. Do not allow him to slow your progress.
The man to whom you are conversing is a psychopath and is trying to control you.
The next day I went with my boyfriend to eat at the restaurant to which we were going.
There are no men in this town worth dating.
I want her to be interested in me.
You should not think that way because it can give everyone the impression that you are unintelligent.
Did his boss give him a difficult time?
She has a constant fear.
Beautiful girls are everywhere. You should look around you.
Distance makes lies harder to hide.
I expect he will go to jail even though it was mutual.
Commercials will say that condoms do not always protect, but using one is better than nothing!
It is a different one each weak, but check for the signs like eye contact and flirting.
Should I break up with her, or roll with the punches, and trust that she really cares for me?
Do not ever go to places that you used to hang out at a lot.
Do you thing I should go back there, or should I stay home?
You do not have to feel bad or hurt if he tries to put you down, life is too short to let things worry you.
Yes, you love him but, you do not want to risk him giving you something that he has brought back.
Most guys are not really short-sighted, you are just meeting the wrong people.
I think it is a big myth that men are just large, mentally challenged, coitus barbarian.
Even though your thoughts are okay, your partner need not know everything you think about.
Of course, unless it was a good dream.
If he wants to be friends, then it is best to move forward.
What one gives out will come back to them.
Of course, it depends on the man.
It is simple. Buy a flower for him and tell him that you love him.
Tell her goodbye, life is too short.
You know, we do it as well!
They boy is fourteen to sixteen years-old and he likes me.
If you decide to go for it, have fun!
If a man does not want a relationship with you, there is not much you can do about it.
Do whatever makes you happy
It depends on the girl I guess, but I lie constantly and I get away with it.
Imagination is the key because you only get what you can imagine.
It is not a good idea to date everyone.
Have you ever heard of a pajama party?
Guys do like it when a woman has a broad vocabulary,  or at least are not too busy to look words up.
Riza, if you do not know the reason, then why answer? It could be a strange person.
I have been there. The place is very good.
Attempt to ignore the man and it will be forgotten eventually.
To answer your question: no, there is no way to understand men.
Merely wanting to meet friends in Amsterdam.
She acts like she is doesn't enjoy it, so should I date her or let her be?
You need to take it slow, no one likes to hear that they are not a good kisser.
It is like asking if love has ever existed, not everyone is bad.
Do you have schizophrenia?
What question do you enjoy?
Do exciting activities, such as covering yourselves in whipped cream or some other delicious food.
Do  not merely wait for something good to occur.
What do you do if he is very attractive?
Threaten him by saying you will contact the police if he does not pay child support.
Without regard to whether or not they chuckle on the occasion.
I have no certainty as to my course of action.
Initially, his comment in and of itself merely demonstrates the true extent of his character.
Should it be due to your affection for another, communicate the fact.
They are unwise and mean, they are going to have to learn the hard way.
I guess it makes for quick access.
He has got way too many girl friends, help me, I'm confused.
I say right on to being a virgin, it is a really big sin to not be a virgin.
You can stop trying to control her life.
Why would a man want a relationship with a cold individual such as you are?
I am simply trying to avoid quarrels because she becomes jealous easily.
Some men are made uneasy by marriage and other commitments, and a discussion might be effective.
I would like men to explain whether they would, or would not, date a virgin.
They have no smarts. That is why their head hurts.
Why do men fantasize about an asian girl?
It depends if you want an emotional attachment.
Do what you want to do.
Once someone is a cheater, they always are cheaters.
If you are lonely you can talk to me.
You will say "You can't hurt me anymore" when you are angry.
In all honesty, that is attractive all on its own.
Find someone who is as mature as you are.
I would not be attracted to her in the first place.
It is healthy and natural, but if you are not careful you can get some horrible viruses!
Take a good look in the mirror.
He got what he wanted and now he wants nothing to do with you.
Most men, as you may know, are aroused all the time.
I would also question how much of a friend your best friend is.
If you are considering taking him back, do not.
Send him a message from your mobile phone.
God moves in many ways.
When you are at least 16.
He loves you because you are his lady.
I had the same problem. Look at the answers I recieved.
This is your time and your life.
He will understand and not be bothered by it.
I hope this helps.
Please try to remember this, the leading cause of divorce is getting married.
If he is not able to reciprocate, then do not let him finish the job.
I wish you had no problems fornicating.
Yes, I did, and it was awful.
You cannot force yourself onto anyone or you will have no one.
If you are not improving and enjoying yourselves, then the relationship is over.
I also have that problem, but if you are good at sexual intercourse, I am sure she will not notice.
Give her things that are meaningful.
It depends upon how old you are.
Having younger friends can help you think and feel younger.
Tell the awful woman that you hate her and she needs to back off.
I do not think the husband deserved to have it!
In live, you get that for which you pay.
Yes it is possible; in fact, it happens to me frequently.
No, I am a girl and I only think about sex if I am really in love with someone.
If he is cheating, then you need to make him leave.
Also, if you do not think of anything else, consider any sexually transmitted diseases that he might bring home to you.
No, there is not a way in which girls will every understand boys.
You need to have fun while you are young.
I heard you are getting married soon, when is it?
Honesty is the best policy, it always works for me.
You blew the chances of him asking you out.
I absolutely love all Italian women!
I am still trying to figure that one out myself.
If she is really unattractive, having intercourse won't be worth it.
Why do the more exciting sports have lots of physical contact?
When you have moved on, you won't care if he moves on.
That is not typical for a man.
Most women talk about it, they have sex toy gatherings.
Although, the situation didn't conclude very positively.
Weigh the pros and cons prior to doing so. As a result, you'll avoid speaking incorrectly.
Accomplish the task once you've become betrothed.
She accomplishes it once more, feel ashamed.
All right, therefore approximately three months past, everything commenced with some flirtation.
You should go out with your friends and meet new people.
He will accidentally run into you while you are out and about.
If she is a romantic, buy her flowers and chocolate, even though Valentine's Day is over.
I do not know about you, but I do not like the bad-boy type.
Fun songs are always the way to go.
Introduce him to a friend.
I married someone that I met at a strip club.
I want it more then guys.
Their brains are younger then ours.
He and I met through his brother's friend.
You should think it through very well.
Yes, they are, and I am not one of them.
Hello, How are you?  What do you mean?  I want a friend in Amsterdam. Please send me the information.  Sincerely, Shaba.
I am not at all prudish. I enjoy oral intercourse and pornography, I am also attractive.
As with men not understanding women, most of the time.
Your best friend is not a friend if he had intercourse with your girlfriend.
I do not know. Perhaps I am simply incapable of lying too much.
The least she could say is "no."
I contemplate sexual activity constantly, and to a greater extent than every male friend.
It causes feelings of sadness and negativity. All right, farewell.
It's woeful, the way in which certain persons behave.
Play the selection "Baby, Baby, Stay Gone," a song by Jimmy Wayne.
I don't even talk to other guys.
If that doesn't work, I have no other advice to offer.
If she is already in a relationship, you will have to set your sights on someone else.
It's simple--back up everything you say to her.
It does not fit in the mouth.
If he does not like you kids, break up. Because family comes first.
You can tell by the way they look and talk to you.
I have been to a few concerts.
Some girls do.
I would stop calling and see if he misses you and calls you.
Your future is not bright; it will lead to death.
What are the indications of a man who is flirting?
What is the point of killing an innocent baby?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Well mine is 8 to 9 inches.
Remember Bill Gates was probably dateless and considered ugly and stupid and look at him now.
Strike 1, He doesn't like kids.
Best friends are always more important than women.
A woman who loves and cares about him.
Do not run, he is merely talking.
Keep it, he may be a great man, who wants to be friend.
If he says no, he won't be useful.
Ignore rumors that people start.
If you find out the answer, please contact me.
I am only trying to be just.
Man, I hate to have to say this, but, she was cheating on you with this guy before you guys broke up.
I invited her over, and we went into my bedroom,  and I shut the door.
There is this really handsome guy in my neighborhood.
I am a Gemini actually,  but honestly speaking, I do not believe in horoscopes.
It is the only thing true ladies are serious about.
Instead of a young woman, you should procure a young man for your own liking.
However, I enjoy physical affection.
I really do not think much about it.
Do not say too much.
Hold you head up, and smile.
My advice is to avoid feeling regret.
Is is acceptable for me to have sex with my girlfriend?
If you have a baby, there is someone who fathered it.
I went to clubs simply to have a fun evening.
If that is your answer, yes they can say they won't cheat.
Would you have intercourse with more than one person at once?
I don't believe that would be at all useful.
What if you're interested in someone, but are not sure if they have the same feelings towards you?
What should you do if your boyfriend hasn't called or messaged you in three weeks?
If you have to ask, however, you are probably too young or immature to get married at this time.
The answer is "yes" because nearly all men are like that.
The decision is entirely up to you but don't spend too much time looking.
It does not mean good things for you in terms of dating her.
My male friends tell me that confidence, but not arrogance, is sexy.
Either you call her or you are going to have to work really hard to earn some money and buy a car.
Did you sleep with his brother or his best friend?
You could spread rumors about her where you are.
Do not send an Instant Message, that says age, gender, and location.
I am telling you from personal experience.
Women do not speak of it, a lot.
She did it once. Shame on her.
It can help your relationship.
So, tell the truth and see where it takes you.
I saw them last year. They were doing great.
Do you want someone that does not know what he wants?
You should let her try a sports' bra on.
You should tell her you love her and attempt to find money.
You know you were thinking it.
I do not know you in order to love you.
You should not be having sex in the first place.
You get bored when you are with them.
If you trust him, you should not worry.
You know what you have to do.
If you know he is cheating, you need to dump him.
If he or she truly made you happy, you would be glad to say back off and not flirt.
As good as it may sound, do not do anything for Valentine's Day.
Homosexual men enjoy listening to them.
If he did call, it was at least once per week.
Most men are not unintelligent, you simply associate with unintelligent men.
It is not okay and just because he is male does not make it right.
It depends on the mood of my wife is in at the time.
Do not do it if you are looking for advice.
Do not do anything that you do not want to do.
Does he not trust me?
You are young, and should speak with your mother about that subject.
My apologies; it will continue to be awkward and strange.
I simply am looking for some enjoyable love songs, although it may be somewhat saccharine.
Divorce is not something that children enjoy.
Inform her that there is something you have been wanting to tell her.
I cannot believe he is telling you.
I believe that being with someone is best.
This is the first time I have ever had to do something like this for someone; can you please help me?
You should keep it that way regardless of how angry she becomes.
That is a stupid question to ask and if you do not know, you never will know.
I do not live there so I am sorry but I could not tell you.
Ask her why she is in the relationship, and how she feels about you.
I like the doggystyle position.
They like sexual positions such as being on top, bending over, or doggystyle.
Follow your emotions. What feels right to you?
Do not allow another woman to have a chance with the person in whom you are interested.
Love without intercourse and intercourse after marriage is the best.
If I keep thinking about the man in whom I am interested, I focus on my work or read a book.
That is a good question, I am a girl, so I will never know.
That has to be the worst actions to take toward your friends.
If you have feelings for his friend instead, you should tell him.
I hope you meet some friends soon.
Yes, if you have to ask.
Are you wanting to get married?
Sex is like air and water.
Do not give him too many chances.
It is okay if you like her.
I know he loves me more, because I was still a virgin on our wedding night!
I would not agree that women should attack first!
It depends on if you are a girl as well.
As a man, I know that most men are in relationships for their own gain.
Try this: did the person have intercourse with their spouse before marriage?
Is that a question for a man?
Try searching somewhere other than where degenerates spend time.
Allow him a chance and some time to get to know your children.
It depends on how old you and your mother are.
If you are asking this question, then you are most likely too young to be getting married.
Be patient and listen to what she has to say.
Take action slowly, and do not just leap on him.
I believe he is just not that interested in you.
I can tell you one thing, and that is if you cheated on her you need help.
You have to be confident to flirt with us. Remember to be sweet as well.
Don't have sex with him, see what occurs. It's great advice.
I do, however, like him.
There is no problem if you agree with him; however, what are your feelings in this regard?
The most important consideration is to enjoy yourself.
That does not, however, mean that it is over.
I know that he also would not want me to do it.
Even woman cheat, you don't have to be Christian.
I believe they think the same thing about girls.
It is to show someone's action and phrases from a certain individual.
He would not have cheated if he did it.
We never became a couple because I was dating his best friend Matt.
In the event he actually is unfamiliar with the females, it should have no impact.
Also, you should behave very respectfully in relation to it, as well.
All right, his age is between 14 and 16, and your age is what?
I'm unable to comprehend why I squandered a large portion of my lifetime in a relationship with a low-quality person such as yourself!
What should I try because I want to spice things up.
It takes time to develop.
Tell him him right away about the phone call.
It is as you said: he is in love with another woman.
I would have intercourse with her even if she had just done so with another man.
My friends do not like him and constantly mock him.
Allow your personality to show. Do not pretend to be someone else, women can sense that.
It is strange that you asked because I felt that way about a woman once. I cannot explain why.
Get used to men only wanting to use you.
It is fate.
Willy, my mothers friend, lives there. You can attempt to find people on Myspace. There are people everywhere.
One solution would be to grab a male whom you have never met and have sex or get married right away.
It would be enjoyable to have a picnic lunch in a beautiful, quiet and private setting.
You should be careful that you don't end up staying in that hostel.
If it is something that you enjoy, then what is the problem?
When you want to give him a bear hug every time you see him.
Everything reminds me of him and what it used to be.
It's so natural, why make and issue out of it?
I just broke up with my girlfriend but it's harder to get another one.  Can you help me?
Did he do it on purpose?
I was thinking about how I should kiss her next time.
But, I really do love this girl.
Yes, as long as she is not their supervisor.
A lack of circumcision is unattractive to me.
From my experience, it depends on both of you.
If she doesn't like you enough to stay with you only, then it isn't worth it.
I am 13 years old and around 5 feet 10 inches.
Have a great honeymoon!
My boyfriend notices women when he is driving and tries to not make it obvious.
I hate those kinds of people, money can't buy you class.
Refrain from initiating action because she'll receive her due at some future date and time.
Oh, also were men aware of your comment, you'd be severely unpopular, for your edification.
Existence possesses such a quality, individuals causing pain for one another.
My virginity was forsaken at 17 years of age; I was genuinely unaware of the reason underlying the excess of hyperbole.
Simply inquire if he'd object to your transmittal of those types of photographs.
No, but you should take care of it before you try to get pregnant.
If he says it's nothing, tell him that you are not stupid.
Did you say for the better or worse?
Anytime he says :"Come here", you go right behind him.
To my best friend forever- I like cereal!
A baby can not decide if it wants to live or die
It make me feel good about myself when other men hit on and flirt with me.
One said, "I can not leave my kids." The other said, "Why do you want to have coffee with me?"
Where is he working and how many hours? Ask him.
I think she is 18.  There is no need to rush things, though.
Some guys do not like girls playing with their behinds.
Women are a mystery, and men like it that way!
However, I really do love her.
I believe that he does trust you.
I like this one guy that used to be in my class.
I merely enjoy receiving advice.
Is it not torture for one and arrogance for the other?
Tell them that you love them and see if they tell you the same.
That is how people naturally behave. There is nothing you can do.
I am so loud that we literally received complaints from our neighbors.
One day I told him I liked him.
Are you going to let me into the conversation?
Eventually he will understand.
If you like this boy, you should go out with him.
Could you be more specific on what type you want? Age counts too.
No one can control their dreams.
Have you seen the Paris hilton video yet?
Trust me, men do not know what is best for women.
Date one of his friends, and see how he takes it.
It is every man's dream, when a woman says that it has no significance.
Or, you could spend time with friends, take your mind off of him, and have fun, girl!
I do not have experience in the matter, and therefore cannot answer. I do, however, think it is possible.
I think she wants to come to America like everyone else seems to be doing. That is me.
He likely believes it is a good thing.
The admiration is not a good reason to kiss.
Crying is normal, but talking may be more productive.
Pregnant women tend to lose interest in that way.
Talk to him and try to understand what made him act rudely.
I would likely not date a stripper.
You no longer want to see the face of that person.
He wouldn't care if he did know!
Some guy was following me in a store, I ran.
They used to be friends.
I want to be myself and not scare her away.
It sounds like you are more hung up on virginity than most men would be.
Tell him without having sex with him. You will not come across as being easy.
She never got over the first time.
Why did you marry him if he is quiet and you want him to talk to you?
Be young, and have fun, don't take life too seriously.
I'm sorry, but you need to get a job.
No if you're over 40, no one minds you anymore.
I don't like hurting people.
He just enjoys conversing with you.
The 3 year old already has a daddy.
I want to be with my ex boyfriend.
Find some Barry White songs, they work for setting the mood.
You could find a beautiful, blonde, tall girl who is not that smart.
In retrospect I am not certain why I acted in that manner.
Perhaps it is because you sound quite sorry.
I believe the best way to start is to be honest and ask him what he thinks.
I have damaged Jon's friendship with Matt.
Perhaps it was an unwise thing for him to tell you, but in any event you should not worry about it.
I liekd this guy, and he used to like me too.
The headboard thing ruined the mood, and I did not get to come.
I would give you 100 points for that answer.
There are a lot of great suggestions.
Do not start talking about kids around your parents.
I let him ask me out.
I found out that my girlfriend was biologically a boy.
She knows she has to move on, but she can't do it. Does anyone have advice for her?
You answered your own question.
Because they believe they're well-liked and attractive and they simply possess those qualities in regard to courting.
For most, it is silent save for when it is extremely well-done, in which case I would act loudly.
Certain persons enjoy "snuggling," others not so much.
Avoid being idiotic, as I have seemed.
However, I'm not the person who committed any forbidden acts. I adore him so intensely, what steps should I take?
It is not the only things that is true.
Jon and I used to be close, and talk frequently.
Did he tell you he was not interested?
Then I started smoking and drinking.
Why waste your time on someone that would disrespect you in that kind of way?
If girls don't like you for that, they have problems.
Can't he get rid of a girl to share hers with him?
My advise for you is don't go out with a stranger.
Do you really want him back in your life?
You have to go to Iraq, but keep in touch.
There are times that I think only about sex.
Should you be able to know when a girl likes you?
They just want to beloved.
You should refuse to get together with her if she has been drinking.
He told me that they do not mean anything to him.
Go have fun.
I think you only have lust for him.
Also, tell him about your bad experience with someone who tried things that made you mad.
No, I am being serious, do not get him another dog.
For me, a girl that is mature.
Was I not attractive to him that night?
He doesn't love you. Break off the relationship, and don't listen to his excuses.
I would work with him some more.
Accept this as truth, darling, individuals are sometimes different than they initially present themselves.
You're unable to prevent it from continuing. It's akin to reflexive action and we are simply inclined.
In my singular opinion, I do not prefer artificial breasts.
Life is like a roller coaster; you need to adapt to it.
Take a stand.
Your boyfriend is not your boyfriend.
I began liking someone new when they asked me out so just ask.
Can I get custody even though he has been a stay-at-home dad?
Men want women to be ladies in public and loose women in the bedroom.
Have oral sex once in a while.
Maybe both of you should take a warm bath!
Introduce yourself, smile, and be cordial.
Are you mature enough to manage a serious relationship?
When women gather, that is one of the main topics of conversation.
You most likely would not get married anyway, so locate someone new.
Because we cause them to become nervous and they lose their wits.
Because they usually enjoy making you feel bad.
Also they are more romantic, in my opinion.
Your age is too low and an excess of negative events can result.
A reason exists to explain this occurrence. So simply practice patience. All clouds possess silver linings. "Hugs".
Don't forget, a man merely being aware of your involvement is no indicator that he won't still make an attempt.
I'd not even go so far as to sacrifice five seconds in service of a female who's incredibly attractive yet persistently idiotic!
Correct, much benefit is derived from resisting sexual activity.
A guy that is too exhausted for sex?
You are not old, and shouldn't you be doing things that you enjoy doing?
If you want to meet pretty women I would go to the library or Walmart.
In the meantime continue to flirt, and get to know him better.
Do not let him see you in a depressed mood.
Yes, if you speak of a male friend, he already likes you. Just letting you know.
Trust me, I am a guy.
Tell him you do not want to marry him and if he continues, break up with him.
Do you prefer circumcised or a foreskin? Why?
The next day I emailed one of them and she said she did not want to be my friend.
How do I get out of it?
No, that means that you are the girl of my dreams.
We can get to know each other better.
I believe that you will find your true love some day so you need to have faith.
If you cheat once, you will most likely cheat again.
All gentlemen are different when it comes to girls; we fall for all types of girls.
Tell him all relevant information.

And he was under the impression I had an enjoyable experience.
I'm informed by her that her affection for me is genuine.
Include me in the participants for that activity.
Just in the event you two individuals are the closest of companions.
He did not love you, know how I know?
Your charming smile baby, which costs nothing.
I do not care about them just leave them, trust me you will not get anywhere with these people.
It is important that you have to love the person you are making love with.
When I catch him staring at a woman he denies it and yells at me.
Do not let a man walk over you.
Why not poke every man's eyes out?
The meaning of that is that you have a new little sister.
I am 26 years old and waited until I was married to have sex.
You should not be concerned because everyone is attracted to other people.

You do not want to lose him as a friend.
You should get some electronics.
I reccommend that you show him more love and attention.
I pray that you are preserved.
But you are not asking anything here.
Most will if they get the chance but you are not married, so I think it is about 99% probability.
I agree with user Rockhead. Do not tell anyone.
You should have intercourse when you are aroused.
You get even by improving from how you were when you met her.
That is the first and last time I have sex while watching television.

Try emailing him your question.
They act like that because they cannot "score."
Everyone is beautiful.
See how it goes.
Look at Yahoo! answers.
I have gained 2 pounds.
Just because you love him, does not mean he loves you.
Because pain is akin to pleasure, and when one bleeds, one experience a feeling similar to sexual release.
No, but the reason is that men's hormones are different from women's.
All of that is true. I become that way occasionally.
I suggest not taking it very seriously. It was only a dream.
That means you can have both options without leaving anything.
It is time to move on. It may hurt, but that is how life works.
Do not hurt him, but do not hurt yourself either.
It is the way of life.
We are not talkign about playing dumb.

If I like a man, I ask him out before another woman can.
I am not going to post that sort of peronal information here.
It appears to me that the relationship is over.
My boyfriend, who I have been involved with for longer than a year, has been lying to me the whole time.
It is the same reason as mine.
Yes, as long as he loves you, then it is no longer a problem. Love does not involve money, do not judge it by money.
She will always be there for you when you need her and she will care about you.
I fell to my knees. I will never forget that strange moment.
However, she has not faith in me because I've made reminiscent comments to both individuals.
I promise that every female who believes she excessively obsesses over sexual activity has no actual understanding.
Be original. That's all that's necessary.
If your in a relationship with a similar women, you might want to reconsider it. If she's worth the pain.
Obtain a job. Then you'll have your own money.
They are very much in love and think that there is hope.
Go out with her friend. Maybe she will change her mind.

If joy can and if it concerns love, then it is probably good.
Not all men, it depends on the man.
Yes, it is, but are you in love?

No, maybe he would like to speak to you before he goes to sleep.

A time when you cannot get a person off your mind.
I would ask her if it was yours.

No, you need to be wise.

Try "yes" if you like him, and "no" if you do not!
Trust your sense of humor, your beauty, your intelligence, you relationships and how you connect with others, and characteristics like that.
You are doing the right thing. Just divorce him, and get back to living your life.
Stop dreaming and thinking about what could be.
If he genuinely loves you, then he would not care whether or not you have anything to offer.
you can go to the beach or a restaurant.

He has a boyfriend that is his friend too.
I was dating a friend of my girlfriend, and we broke up.
If he is kind to you and has a nice personality, then yes.
If he is interested in you, then tell him that you love him. It will initiate a romance. It worked well for me.

Don't know, cook him dinner and show him you care.
We think we are giving them signals but they don't get it.
Although I'm sure they could, we all know what the decision would be.
Maybe you should not be worried at all.
Kiss her on the cheek first, and if she understands what you mean she will carry on from there.
My husband and I moved in after two weeks.
It is how you use it and not the size.
You are welcome to party, too, because everyone has the right to enjoy my girlfriend while she is stripping.
All you can do is think about them when you hear that love song.
Are you in love with someone?
She is still your friend regardless.
I know quite a bit, email me and I will talk to you.
Don't try to impress her, just express your feelings towards her.
Are you part Irish?
Maybe that is why they are called fantasies.
Some understand it and do very well, while others do not.
They do not have to be half dressed.
If you find the answer to that question, please let me know.
I want to do things with you that I would not even do to an Oreo.
I am very mature, so do not mess with me!
Do not go up to him and say that you want to have relations with you sister very badly.
Until that time, try to be kinder.
If you really like him, you'll simply know!
Not a bad person at all.
It doesn't matter if you're doing everything accurately.
Try to be kind, relaxed, calm, and let her know you like her.
People do not do things unless they benefit them in some way.
I believe a woman should make her own decisions.
You should call him and ask.
I am a twenty year-old woman.
People invent many reasons to explain why they have not found the right person.
You could still have a friendship. You could even have a friendship and continue having sex.
Furthermore, you are hoping that he will propose marriage to you.
Will you go on a date with me?
If you wait, you will not get anywhere.
You just have to be normal.
I make a different choice every so often.
Start to find someone more compatable and closer in age.
Have I told you lately that I love you?
It can mean different things.
Look at what you are wearing.
When you like someone, who feels the same way towards you.
You aren't getting anything.
You should focus on getting Level 3 next.
She should make a decision, so she can prevent getting pregnant.
From a woman's perspective, I don't think about intercourse as much as my ex boyfriend.
I do not like to complain though.
One question I have is why would you want to marry a person who is in jail?
We have flirted many times but I am simply unsure.
It is not men in general, it is the particular man that you dated.
However, I immediately disliked him.
Then there are many questions on whether I have had anal intercourse.
Speak with your eyes.
Women want it slow and take too long to obtain it. Men want it without a build-up.
And we sat on my bed, made eye contact, hugged, and kissed passionately.
Why get married? Simply become someone's coitus slave.
You have accept the sad truth.
Do you not love your ex girlfriend, at all?
You have two choices. Get over him, or wait for him.
Now days, it is hard to find a virgin.
You are a liar.
I am just wondering, thank you for the answer.
I suggest you find the company of a tough, manly male.
I care for him greatly, but only as a friend.
I am a self-proclaimed sex-addict. I do not know if something is wrong with me, or if I simply enjoy sex.
She may tell the truth to you if she does not want to be with you any longer.
If you do not want to have sex with the man, it is okay to say no.
Who broke up with who?
You should dress like a lady and you may find a nicer man.
I'll try anything once, and once more if I enjoy it.
As long as it doesn't become physical. I don't see why not.
I'm uncertain. Are you ready?
Jon stated to wait with Matt.
He'll be pleasantly surprised, and will love you all the more for it.
And I told him yes. Very much.
Be unfaithful to her with one of her friends and be better to the friend than you were to her.
Why bother if you do not intend to marry him?
The problem is that women who have a bad scent do not know it.
Most men care about that while some do not.It depends on the man.
Tell him to go away.
You really should break up with him and get yourself some self-esteem.
It is probably because women do not like weak men.
Yes, men think about copulation more that girls.
Perhaps it because you are doing something incorrectly.
Simply because someone is older does not mean he is near death.
Are there reasons you do not trust him?
I recommend handing them a toilet brush.
Let me know if you want more at digital_lyricist@yahoo.com.
If you want to get married, then you should do so.
I do not believe in astrology.
Men are beautiful regardless of anything else.
You should just ask him straight up, if he wants to marry you.
Too much of a good thing can turn into a bother.
They have a one-track mind.
Does he like your kids, and vice versa?
You should have your fun now, while you are young.
Because it is called lust, which is a sin.
I simply have some anxiety about it.
My new girl means quite a bit to me.
Make sure it is good, wholesome fun.
Now you receive two of everything.
There is a man for every woman.
Go to the movies, sight-seeing, etc.
That is slightly difficult.
You need to get angry.
Perhaps she wants to have intercourse with someone other than you.
From where do you obtain these statistics?
If you connect with someone then do not worry about other people's feelings.
I love being sexual on the phone with my boyfriend.
Just tell him in person, nicely, that you are done.
It is easy to find someone to marry you in jail.
What if some man asked, why are all women promiscuous?
She may act like that again, but thank you I will be sure to tell him.
Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.
If he is going to mart the girl, she shouldn't have been with many other men.
I am a man with traditional values.
You are a sinner if the people you call friends are unsaved.
You can only rely on faith that what the other person says is truth.
She may have the same feelings that you do.
Some men say a good girlfriend must have good looks, habits and a great figure.
Consider getting a job and sending him money.
Gift her with a nice present, then ask her immediately.
In that event she will certainly think you are  hiding something.
Do not focus on looks; rather, evaluate people on how they treat you.
Does anyone here possess the ability to speak fluent English?
It is about the one who you are with.
Who could say no?
Please repeat, "It's not my fault!".
I have two. Your decision.
She questioned me regarding my sensitivities.
My husband will make a right, and be there.
Then one day he began to court me.
Only if you feel as though you need a boyfriend.
No, because the same thing happened to me, but it may be different.
Would it bother him if you were asking men for photographs?
You are just experiencing new things which is a good thing.
Not if it was not meant to be.
If he likes you for your activities, then start doing ones that he would not like.
You might spook him if you talk about marriage, kids, and family.
Send flowers but not roses, that might be too strong.
You do not have to run but you might want to tell him to slow down.
When Matt and I first got together, I really like Jon and I did not know he liked me also.
I would hide their lunch box and not play with them at recess.
No, I think you cannot spell.
You probably can do a lot better.
That is not any of your business!
In addition, it make speople more jealous and anxious so watch out for that also.
I have had this problem many times and I say to keep both of them but be very careful about your choices!
It may be too late to attempt a procedure.
I will tell you what a lot of men I know dream of.
If he treated her right, I see nothing wrong with it. It is not as if she is your sister.
Men love themselves. It is unhealthy.
If she likes you, then she should know that you are new at it.
It's dependent upon yourself. However, is it something you'd desire to have happen?
However, it simply vexes me due to the fact that I'd like to engage with him, however, I have a desire to postpone!
Should you fancy another gentleman, however, it's most advantageous to simply express it!
Do you not have one or are you having trouble with the one you have?
He is not an addict.
Be friendly and not forward.
He probably did not answer your calls because he was truly busy.
Ask them when they are hooked up to a lie detector.
I like him but I am not in love with him.
Go to the gym and workout.  Practice speaking with a lower voice and be confident.
I would be straight up with your friend.
You can do better.
Tell him that your baby is in need of him.
I feel too old and I am only 20.
Do not blow it on a thing called intercourse.
Why can they not treat us with respect?
He is probably cheating on you if he is still talking to her.
Once she leaves him Karma will come around and get back to him.
I would say yes in most cases.
Women are not easily sexually aroused, you need heop
Do not probe, let him tell you when he feels competent enough to do it.
If I had to choose a certain man, he would be black, white men do not use form
No, you need to get him out of you life and find someone else.
Now I am pregnant with his child. How do I tell him without upsetting him?
Refrain from prolonging the process, however, assure that it's brief and direct.
Do you have a desire to be criticized as unintelligent?
I'm uncertain since my spouse-to-be and myself both have that quality.
My man tells me it gives him the opportunity to tell me that I am attractive.
I, too, like children but I am not one.
It is not just confined to men.
I would not necessarily break off a friendship simply because we have a disagreement.
Can you see yourself as being contented with this person for the rest of your life?
Think about the reason that the two of you broke up and then move on.
Go where your phallus leads you, even if it is in the wrong direction.
I need advice from other people.
Dump you girlfriend, trust me, she would be shocked.
A personality that is not too bad.
I do not think that girls are bad liars.
Well, it disgusts me , but others get intense pleasure from it, you never know.
It is only normal to cool off, I guess.
You must inquire of yourself whether you have feelings for him!
Seems like a low-quality partner, in my opinion. However, that's solely my opinion.
If you are attracted to males and females, you're therefore bisexually oriented.
He ought to possess enough compassion, not toy with a person's emotions.
To begin, select specifically a single man you're enraptured by.
Men are also people, and they have feelings just as women do.
I cannot think of any reason.
I would not want my boyfriend to have lunch with a different woman on Valentines Day.
There are many reasons that marriages break up, including financial issues, children, infidelity, and stress.
Older children might enjoy putt putt golf, laser tag, or go-karts.
I have loved my boyfriend for eight years.
I am mature for my age as well.
When you find someone special, hopefully they will love you for you.
She is the boss, and you had an intimate moment with her, that is all.
My concern is how to say now while remaining friends.
Unless you tell him the truth, you will never be certain.
I am a man and recommend that you proceed slowly and steadily.
My recommendation is that you tell them directly and at the right moment, and not when many people are present.
Those who are patient receive good things.
Show her she is more important than your friends.
First of all, no, it is not always about the outward appearance of a woman.
However, he is as clueless as I am.
I have been nothing but nice to her every day. What should I do?
What kind of father does that make him?
If she breaks your heart, it will be your fault, you should have listened to my advice.
I loved this man, but he humiliated me in front a small crowd, and I don't know what I should do now.
Perhaps, you two should separate for a short period of time.
It is an easier way of saying he just wants to have intercourse.
Are you just excited about being in love?
If he wants to be friends, then so be it.
Have you ever wondered why they fight all of the time?
That i all they ever think about.
We are not mind readers.
That guy is misleading you.
You are single and can not find a date.
If you become involved in trouble, then you will leave with trouble.
I forgot about an important question for women: have you ever used the sample cosmetics at the shopping mall?
Or, one day, kiss him.
And it depends on if he likes war games, sports, role-playing, etc.
All men do it, even when they are married.
I enjoy dreaming of different men, which I suppose is acceptable.
However, you will never find a woman willing to admit it.
If you are asking this, it means you love your wife.
If he does not know who you are, it appears very difficult, but it is worth trying.
Brush your mouth twice and there will be no trouble.
Some men are stunned when they are around an attractive woman like myself.
If not, no. If you are younger than twelve, then no.
What you do is simple, know their emotions and discuss them.
The pay is great, but there is a lot of stuff in those places.
It will depend on how it is.
You will not meet anyone who wants to have a serious relationship unless you have a big penis.
Is that true? I tried talking to him but he will not return my calls.
Tell them how sad you are.
Come join me in Romania, I already live there!
One day you wake up with the knowledge.
They are happy, so it could work for you as well.
Trust me, you do not do anything with a friend's younger sister.
If you only want to be with him, then stay with him.
We should converse via Yahoo, shrunkenmann_thegrass (females exclusively).
She sincerely admires you and believes you share a friendship and most likely not anything further.
I would't be concerned regarding the embarrassment quotient that's present.
Oh, indeed, if you genuinely feel compelled to do so...deliver one to him, as well.
You have some work to do.
You need to have a serious talk with her and let her know that it is childish and you are maturing.
Communication, but are you certain you want to do that?
If you cannot say the words to his face, scream them in the mirror when he is not around. Do you know why?
Do not do anything.
No, it is only if they are sick.
You will show him how if not.
I am looking for a virgin girl.
Yes, your mother is going steady with him.
He will love you even more.
If you think this could lead to heartbreak, then wait and watch what happens!
He must have been a friend at one time.
The phrase to use is "I have enough friends".
Keep your eye on her because she is not much of a best friend.
Yahoo Personals may have a man you might like.
Then tell him that you could go on a date sometime, if he is interested.
Examine that for a time.
Perhaps my mother, but that is another story.
You may be too attractive for your own good.
Go on a cruise and push her overboard.
Please don't push her or tell her that you love her.
That is not a bad thing if you enjoy it with a responsible person.
Because they don't think with the heads on their shoulders.
You should believe in yourself, which is really sexy.
I have dated several bisexual females and it turns out big time.
If I am truly considering it, I would prefer to be with both of them.
No, he simply likes exchanging girlfriends every now and then.
Both; but, if I must choose only one, then beauty.
From my point of view, whatever your instinct tells you is happening is what is happening.
I suppose a little of both.
Have sex with a loved one.
As Lumbeeman said, "have your best friend tell him for you."
Yes, he is a man and that is what we do!
But every time I return it is the same bad things over again.
Try to allow him to know you.
You do not know what real problems are until you get married and have children.
That is a lie. If you love the person, then your relationship will remain steady no matter what happens.
I always feel like him when we meet.
He may be checking to see if you are alright.
As long as you have love, life will be full of sweet meanings.
You can contact me at anytime.
You are still going to feel as though you cannot trust men.
You cannot expect to give him anything too expensive.
Believe what you want to believe.
I would date a woman who was a stripper because it would not matter who she was.
Sense of humor is very important.
He says that he respects that I want to wait and he understands.
I thought this man was interested in me. He used to stare at me often.
But if you are fine with it, then it should be alright.
Simply assure her that her parents both love her very much even though they do not live together any longer.
You will prove to be a great sister.
I suppose people want what they cannot have.
You can like whoever you like.
You should tell her to wait.
You should tell your partner and understand his response. Help yourself to help one another.
My husband and I got married, July 7, 2001 and went to Hawaii for two weeks.
If you are not, it will be rough intercourse and will hurt.
What do I do with both of them?
I would sya no, unless you love it.
There are some men who do not care what they look like.
Where do you want it to go?
Maybe he isn't lonely.
Let him go if he continues to harass you.
How much success will you feel when you find love?
Try understanding women and then you'll find one.
What does love mean anymore?
You urinate from that place, and do not even wipe.
A man that is not complete desperate will not ask you out again if you broke up with him, already.
We try to make females feel comfortable.
If I see you with another girl, I will rip her arms off.
You need to get a job.
You have to ask yourself if he is a nice and decent person.
I have a friend who has a very, very cool piercing on the hood of her clitoris.
So, how do I approach a woman and ask her to come over to my place, and to be my girlfriend?
Then, you know what you have to do then, forgive them.
It is true what everyone else said.
I would rather have a girl who is not a virgin.
To surprise her, tell her in the middle of a conversation.
If he does that, he cares for you.
If you are true, true love will find you.
See if she returns your email, or you will find out in person.
It is easier to move on, two wrongs do not make it right.
Tell them that they will never get anywhere in life by decieving people!
Dogs are like apart of the family, trust me , I know!
Do it only if your heart desires you to have it, if you instincts say do not do it, then do not go through with it.
Of course, stop and say hello.
If they are hurting themselves too much to listen, however, find another adult such as a grandparent.
I know a woman who was married to a violent man who abused their children.
It is because they have a guilty conscience.
After the police left, the guy was in custody, and the kids were back in bed.
If she is not willing, stop trying to do it.
I would like to talk to someone.
You are like a complete stranger to me.
I do not think that most guys are stupid.
Well you are a lesbian, if you are a girl who is attracted to a lesbian!
Even if there is some truth to what he is saying, why would he text message other women, asking for their nude photographs?
I love my ex with all of my heart.
Firstly, do not tel him. Go to your mother, or a school social worker, and et them talk to your parents.
It is not as difficult if you know what you are doing.
If it is love, he will wait and not be unfaithful to you.
Make them laugh and they will love you.
Men like this are not worthwhile.
Unless you enjoy being treated poorly.
I would not enjoy being the seventh man if she thinks of the eighth.
I will be twenty-one years old on August 10, 2006. That's true.
This is the love which most people seek but are too lazy to earn.
Perhaps because they knew you would be very angry.
Converse with her and discover whether or not she is interested in you.
That is a great way to start the day.
I gave him a second chance but he did not take it.
When she is free and has the desire to do so, she will.
On top with the lights on is stimulating.
Be a friend. Allow him some time to be alone.
You are beginning to dislike the friends of the person to who you love.
Do something that most people have not done.
It seems to me that love does not die so quickly.
In that case, I think it is nothing to worry about.
Most likely, she still lives with her parents.
That is a serious mistake.
As she is still with you, she cares for you.
Do not worry about those types of things.
He is playing hard to get and you are not.
I am not sure that chickens are concerned with that.
You will get out of it what you put into it.
Perhaps yes, if you smell better.
Move on and think about how lucky you are to not be with him!
What can I do to get her to lose weight?
Leave him because he is not worth your time.
A lot of attention and to be fed some good chocolate.
If he is too possessive then break it off.
When you can hear each other with out talking.
You will not be disappointed if you try it sometime.
It was insensitive of her to do those things in front of you. It is obvious!
Other than that go to a party and hit on intoxicated women.
Question him? It might be uncomfortable, but it will be worth it if he loves you.
State, "I love You.", if it's true love. It will occur when it needs to.
It will be worth it.
I'm attracted to imbeciles. What's my issue?
Should I pack my husband's bags?
You do not have to have a relationship.
Why does my ex boyfriend keep trying to make me jealous?
My best friend is a man. We have never attempted to take it further.
In my case, it did not.
Hang out with her, perhaps take her shopping...
Sorry, but no - he is seeing someone.
If you love someone, simply tell him so.
My father is the same way.
It sounds like he needs to mature.
I am not asking him to go out or anything even close to that!
So, firstly, boys  say things they do not really mean.
Just find another girl, she does not love you.
Marrying the lady of my dreams would mean that I have everything I dreamed of.
Really get to know her.
I have a child and am married; but, I want to be single.
If you care that much, find another man.
You deserve someone who will listen to you first.
Only if you are of age.
He said, "Hello, woman. What is going on?"
And you already had intercourse with this man.
You can apologize, but you cannot have him again. Accept what you already decided.
Try to watch pornography together.
You need to ask her why she does not like you.
Do not make a move because she has a boyfriend.
It can work if you want it to.
You have missed your chance and she has moved on.
You know you are in love if you are intimate with him.
Because, as you know, I attend the same school as you.
i invite the women reading this to tell him.
Just be patient and do not rush.
I once heard that is was not so.
Furthmore, avoid the plants that I mentioned.
People are not always smart.
It is never a boring thing.
I have been with my husband since I was 19 and I am going to be 26 next month.
Never buy a woman lingerie unless it is something she has said she wants.
I do not think it is a bad choice.
I asked her to dance and now we are friends.
Either that or attempt to find his other personality and accept him.
If he cannot respect you, then he has to leave.
In truth, whether or not my friends agree, they cannot ever find another friend like me.
Instead of telling him, show him what you like.
You do not find her. It will happen on its own.
You do understand they are using you, do you not?
Since you are not sure, then you know it is not worth it.
I would marry your cat to get into the family.
Before too long. You made them love you even though it was bad for them.
I am right here. All you need to do is ask.
Become akin to wild animals. Have intercourse at any location.
Good luck. You will need it.
Is it legal, or just not morally right?
My sister is not intelligent and is pregnant with his baby.
A girl should know what she wants.
He had slept with his best friends wife.
Do you really enjoy hurting people who are so important to you?
You are the one who must that you don't want to be unhappy any longer.
I would not want or need anyone else.
It was an event that occurred without your knowledge.
I suggest that you focus first on becoming a friend to a woman.
He probably won't tell you but he's likely to tell someone else.
Because when you are in a relationship and you go our for fun it kills your partner.
He is a piece of shit and I never want to see him again.
She might be able to fake moaning, shaking, thrashing around and stuff but she can't fake that.
Maybe you have but you didn't know it.
Planning is good, but don't plan excessively.
We get along wonderfully except for this one difficulty.
Could now be a good time to move on to a different place?
He or one of your friends who knows him might know. Ask one of them.
Tell him that you are a beautiful vampire.
The coaches were more relaxed, and I usually played over half the game.
They have left us no choice but to separate, but I will never stop loving him.
Begin by stating that I want to kiss you on the nose, mouth, cheek, and neck in that order.
Do not tell him you want to have sex with him.
I am not sure, are you in love?
Wait and it will be worth the time.
I do not believe you should afford him any more chances. You do not want to be hurt again.
He will discover that with someone else., but you want something more, do you not?
Cause them to want to break up with you.
If he loves you, then he will be in pain, but he will recover.
You should not be with a man who pressures you to do things that you are not comfortable with.
Some men that have experience do not know what they are doing.
Be intmate with people who are good at math. They know how to handle curves.
You have to overdose to get off.
You have tried too hard.
What was that about? Now I am curious as well.
A high class strip club with a lot of alcohol.
Yes, I would at any time.
This is not the place to find one.
Yes, if you stop being lazy.
That also depends on who you are.
Yes, at least mine do it live.
If you never give it a chance, you'll never know what might have transpired between you two.
I've never heard of a man who did not enjoy this.
Well, if he's going to so much trouble to frighten you, it seems apparent that he is not attracted to you.
Things this important should not be addressed via email.
Why would you ask something so simple, stereotypical, and pointless?
I merely want to help her realize it before something bad happens.
That is not very fair to the man with whom you are currently in a relationship.
They want a genuine man. I do, at least.
I think it is strange and geeky.
That is not a good situation.
If you like him, then it is not bad.
He might only want to have sex with you.
You might love him, but you need to leave him.
You have every right to be upset.
Send the man a post card from Bora Bora or somewhere exotic.
Maybe you should tell her and see how she responds.
Why would you care, it is fine as long as you received yours, correct?
I one hundred percent agree with you there.
A hard face to go with it.
I've asked her to by my girlfriend two times already but she never answers.
You've got nothing better to do with the rest of your life than trying to understand them?
Caring is not everything.
I am 12 and I have a girlfriend.
Ask him to be your boyfriend and that you like him.
That is not bad at all.
You already know so much about one another.
I never talk badly about a person.
You are confusing me, one question at a time.
Cheat on her with a prostitute. They have experience.
Not only men have them, women can too!
Do not use intercourse as a weapon in your marriage.
That way you get to be with other women while not cheating.
What happened to his Queen Kong?
Maybe but I will never find him.
Do not do it in private.
It does not matter what gender they are.
Take a shower, use deodorant, and always have fresh breath.
Whether or not you are wearing a skirt and heeled shoes or loose jeans.
Return to pleasuring yourself orally.
He used to abuse me mentally and physically.
I have dated guys who are tall and muscular.
Do you have the same kind of behind as a chicken?
If you like her, ask her on a date, and see what happens from there.
Tell your man that you do not like that man.
No man wants to be only friends with women.
What do you think about marriage?
I would not date a large man.
Try to stay out of it this time untill they are calm.
I like the song 'Sex and Candy.'
It is better to loose a lover then like someone with no ambition.
If I guy did that to me, I would move on.
The way I have always approached it is to go out with a friend.
In the first place, do not do anything unless you want to do it.
I agree with Gab's observation that there is no way to know.
As a 40-year old woman, you should look for someone of a similar age.
Do not pressure women as it will not result in a positive response.
Why don't you give her a telephone card, or send her a Valentine's card?
You might lose the one you love, to another person.
My best friend went on a date with a very short man and they even kissed each other.
I am only 38, why would anyone lie about that age?
What exactly do men want from women?
Last night, when I was talking with my former lover, I asked that question of him.
If he is a nice man, then he will understand and probably stop if he likes you.
And one additional piece of advice: trust her.
Surprise him, you can do it!
Just wait. Maybe it is not the time for you to meet the right one.
No, it is not normal, it is abnormal.
I am confused. What were you asking?
If he did, he would not even have looked at the other girl.
If I could arrange the alphabet, I would put U next to I.
Personally, I cannot even think of going out with someone I broke up with.
Why do men cheat?
She has been living for you.
Where do you live?
You seem to be hanging onto a dream, Dr. Checko.
Who can assemble me again?
Ask someone you trust, or, a doctor.
Someone who loves you should consider your feelings.
Where does the child's father come into play?
You should date your cousin.
My girlfriend, my love, my everything, she is perfect.
Men can be friends with women.
You may find that you don't like having intercourse with women.
I believe unintelligent far exceeds foolish.
Because once they are interested, there is no longer any need to pursue them.
Why would you go with someone who is that young or old?
Some men have attractive posteriors.
If he is trying to control you, then leave.
If you truly care for this person then you ought to try it.
No, I would prefer the woman who rejected me die suddenly. I will not care about her at all anymore.
There is no doubt. I am positive.
I think that "no answer" is your response and you simply do not want to acknowledge it.
What are you worried about because love conquers all?
It never can be if you are a teenager or child.
Pick them up around midnight at the nursing home and go to Wendy's.
I love my child's father to death!
This guy has not been in a relationship for a significant amount of time.
Read this and tell her to stop.
Who is on your mind?
Men will not consider cheating if the sex remains interesting and exciting.
Sit down with them and explain to them that they should be understanding and support you no matter what happens.
I am merely his friend. I love him, but he seems not to know.
And do you have a problem with this?
Perform the second step if you see no results after three weeks.
I have an ID in Yahoo with a camera.
The man is married!
It is usually the person who is not as good in bed as the other.
It is not boring but fulfilling.
I prefer the lights off, with a few candles and on top of the covers.
Where were you in sex ed?
Do not take anything for granted.
They are not worth your time and thoughts.
Why would he refuse to speak with me?
I enjoy a man with a round posterior, it's attractive.
I have male acquaintances that are similar to a sibling. There's no apprehension.
I heard that a coat hanger, and a vacuum will assist with it.
You should have a nice impression on the woman.
Gather all of your girlfriends and have a party to let her mingle with new faces.
You spelling tells how worried you are.
That is a good start because you sound attractive.
Nobody can do it better than you.
You are very earth-friendly.
Remember that a lot of married men are very happy.
Do not act as though you are pure.
I have the same problem so I know what you mean.
I am sorry this guy said that about you.
Do not mind what other people want.
What do you want to do now?
You need to learn to read a person.
The man said "I am a caveman". The woman responded "What's this?".
Yes, I believe you should rehome the cat.
You should text him.
My masculine ego cannot handle a woman knowing about it.
If you can afford it, women love jewelry.
If she likes the beach, then perhaps a weekend in the Bahamas.
That is how I think about this.
Say no if you do not like the men that asked you out.
It can be attractive to watch a woman, and you might get a pointer or two.
You need to do it in person, make a dinner date.
If you do not use birth control, you might get pregnant.
He is ignoring you for the exact same reason that we are!
When i went out there i noticed the same thing!
I am 28 years old, and I look pretty good.
You should tell her to try asking him out or something similar.
Your question allows people to know that you are single.
You should put your female friends before potential romantic interests.
I would not give my life for a stranger or for a friend.
People don't care for strangers.
Tell him you will only do it this way.
Call and greet them, and just be done with it.
Touch her privates with your nose.
She isn't attracted to you.
Like myself, I am currently in a long distance relationship.
What in the world are you doing?
Do not let her play games with you.
It can not be love, because you do not know her.
It is better to tell someone news over the phone or in person.
You will not find love in the internet.
Do not center your life around her.
Take her out on a date.
Tell them that they should have asked you earlier as you already have a date.
Two points for me and you.
If there is nothing better to do.
She may have an underlying factor that makes her eat this much?
If she is pregnant then it is the end of the procedure.
I was going to ask this question.
It is the one thing that comes before good health on the fuman scale of existance.
Women like to be pampered so take her to dinner or order in with candles and flowers and treat her like a queen.
I like romantic love and it is really fun, too.
So what do you think?
It is neither special nor weird, it is just your personal choice.
Can you check it out for me please?
The question is the opposite. How do you convince your boyfriend to cease courting another woman.
I went to one where they had a belly dancer instead. It was boring.
She already knows that it is not love.
I would not worry about the heroine.
I like to tell jokes and laugh.
It is going to hurt, no matter what you say and how you say it.
What are you good at?
Do not be late, or someone else might take the opportunity.
If they are not, why would they be so mean?
Start cutting him off now so he is accustomed to him by the time you are married.
I recommend saying "I love you," which will watch them off guard.
He clearly does not accept you for yourself, so there is no point in staying and being miserable.
I believe that they will. Why do you not?
Once you cross the line from friendship it is hard to go back.
I think men are more sensitive, but women show it more often.
Get a life and relax.
Just go ahead and text them!
Do not stay with someone who is not right for you. It is not worth it.
You should not believe in it as it is too commercialized.
I think he may be taking advantage of you.
One may be good in bed, and the other may be a good listener.
You are correct, but I must do it or she will be very upset with me.
It is what you make of it.
Why is he sleeping outside with the dog?
At night, do you dream about her?
you have to strike up conversations at the places and activities you enjoy.
I do not want to shake your hand either.
You will not want anything else if you are truly in love.
Honey, I love you with all my heart.
Get yourself together, and don't let it bother you, just have fun dating.
I think she likes me because we flirt, and the two of us converse a lot.
Remain calm, do it, and remember this isn't going to be the best moment in life.
Her appearance doesn't matter.
Being eight is hard is it not?
He will ask for your hand in marriage.
Ask her out.
The information given was a little vague.
I have many friends that are guys and girls.
I hope things turn out right.
Keep your carefree tone from now on.
Marriage results in people acting irresponsible and abusive.
The chances are slim.
What is the worst thing that they could say?
I assume he wants you to have intercourse over the phone with him, but maybe you do not?
Are you implying that there is something not good about me?
Did you read what you just wrote?
And believe me, priorities are important qualities for which to search.
They do not see them, they feel them.
If you are  looking to get married and settle down.
I took my neighbor to the doctors at 7pm last night after work.
Please her sexually as well.
Simply inform her that you occasionally require a hug.
If a guy did not care, then he would not bother.
It was a man, not a boy.
You can not change them.
You have to ask him first.
There is no way to know her virginity untill you have sex.
Be careful and use protection.
Some men just need a bit more stimulation to achieve a satisfying ending.
I frequently tell my man that I like him.
What are a girl's options?
All men love to be in competitions.
You should marry the person you can not live without.
Do you want to have a girlfriend or a boyfriend?
Sex is about giving satifastion, and not being selfish.
Adam and Eve were smart.
It is only about sex for some guys.
My guess is that you do not look the same to her. If you do not inspire her, she feels unimpressed.
You never know, try flirting with women because I find that helps.
Yes, I believe there is hope.
Find a new boyfriend, you are a girl, it should be easy.
Maybe you need Mr. Just For Me.
The way she responds will tell you if she is the right person or not.
If she cannot do the time by raising her child, then do not do the crime and become pregnant.
Well, I would believe what a woman says to you.
If you are beautiful, comment on her hair, outfit, or her shoes.
Once you have talked to her, then decide where you are going to live.
Some people consider being a lesbian or gay is not acceptable.
Adding sex to a friendship does not always amount to love to both men and women.
At least he would like for you to be involved.
Do they hold the opinion that he lacks confidence?
I love my sister, but she seems to put herself into unhealthy relationships.
That is why they call it love.
He accepted my newborn daughter as his own.
You have to remember "food" and "sex" if you want to attract your husband's attention and have sex.
If you watched Spider-man the upsidedown kiss catch him off guard and just lay it on him.
As thick as you want it.
Do not think you will not be getting pleasure from it.
It should be elaborate, public, and show her really how much she means to you, go for it!
If you are attracted to men still then you may be bi.
You have been dating the wrong women.
You might loose them if you hide.
Tell him to close hsi eyes if you are shy.
Who needs him if he acts like that?
He has some serious emotional issues.
You may have already made her uncomfortable.
Let me guess, you'll relocate to New Zealand?
Tell him he is the boss, or leave him to find someone else.
Personality first and foremost, then being in shape, finally, kindness.
We are all a little strange.
Your mom kicked out the wrong person.
If you haven't slept together yet, don't.
To start having boyfriends, 13 but dating like going on dates, 16.
By the way he looks at you and acts toward you.
My father lost approximately 20 pounds just by playing outside.
If these do not work out, leave things as they were and start over in a new direction.
No. Why can't a man talk to another woman without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating on her?
It means exactly what she says it means.
I am twenty eight years old and single.
Perhaps you find a location that is far enough from home, but close enough so your family can visit once a month?
Just approach him and have a casual conversation.
I guess they need to see who is the bigger loser.
If you cannot trust her without you around, then you need to leave her.
I would advise you to not hold back.
I am trying to think about what is on my mind, that's all.
I am not fond of the word "stupid".
My ex said the same thing once before.
A dance is just a dance.
You have a boyfriend that loves you and you love him, too.
If you are not married and have sex it is painful and bloody.
Go to an important vacation resort.
Absoulutely, if it feels right
You can find someone better.
About 3-400 is my guess.
I am too busy to respond.
Not all men funtion the same way.
Of course she yelled about it at the time.
I swear, it was very long.
Tell your lover how special they are to you and why.
I made it and you can as well.
If they avoid the question and/or get angry, then I would be worried.
I suppose you have tried to talk to him?
Many women like it when you make eye-contact.
Yes, find your next boyfriend. Lonely people are out there waiting for you, move forward.
I have a mix between the two.
Is it cool when you are in sixth grade?
It takes time to remember the good times and forget the bad.
You should introduce yourself.
Good for her for being pation even when it upset her.
It once happened to me.
Because you are the only beautiful woman that I see!
How can you tell if someone is truly in love with you?
It does look funny kind of, especially if the girl is significantly taller, but, it is not bad.
No, they cannot because somewhere deep down under there is an attraction to each other.
Why would you do something like that and tell people about it?
If someone does not ask you on a date, does that mean you are unattractive or something?
Love will come to you, so do not rush, alright?
My problem is that I anger women because I am smarter than them.
You know what he is doing, but you do not care, because you allow him to lie.
I believe it depends on how mature the child is.
I say to think long and hard about it.
Oh, and tell your boyfriend why you do not like him.
You may not find her attractive; but, she is happy with herself.
After one month, I can fall in love.
It is similar to suicide; normal to think about, but not do anything about it.
Move on and stalk someone else.
I no longer want to be in a relationship with him.
How can I tell him?
They are not good for you.
I rather like slightly overweight men.
Have fun or stay busy.
How do I know if I am madly in love with her?
You can do many things.
Guys are always commenting on my butt.
The devil's Hell Hounds are tracking his every step
See what she says and then you will have your answer
Is he ruining his life?
Some are way out there.
Because they are loved and if they were not they would not find it.
It will make him feel bad and he will probably not want to have intercourse with you again.
It would seem you have decided to divorce your wife.
Something must be missing from their relationship because they are not happy.
But they still want to have intercourse with you.
I would never, ever pack my husband's bag!
It will happen for sure, that is, if you really love her.
It is not so simple with children.
Most people do not believe in it until they experience it.
It is not bad if you laugh at yourself.
Have a delightful day.
Ask him if he would like to go somewhere with you.
I am also Mexican, but not mixed.
I knew it was hard, but it is better for you.
It depends on how old you are.
She is not interested, or perhaps you came on too strong.
Don't do something you'll regret later.
I don't know where to find him.
There are alot of other guys.
Do you feel you need to doubt that?
I don't feel anything with them.
It is strange that someone so young is answering questions on here.
It will cost you three points per answer.
Why does it matter to you?
If you want to have drinks, make sure it is BYOB.
You have to understand that marriage is not fun and games.
Maybe their husbands are not good enough.
Discover if he is being unfaithful to you.
Have the two of you been spending time with your parents.
A woman wants an honest man.
Nineteen, almost twenty years old. How old are you?
It is wet, interesting, and better if it is forbidden.
You can say it, but whether or not you mean it is what will be questioned.
He would not reconsider not using a condom.
He broke up with you because of what someone else said.
First of all, are you sure that she really loves you?
Sometimes, yes. But you do not know if it is real love.
Sometimes I think it is boring to be a good person all of the time.
The only step is to do this 5 times a day at least.
Just because you are in lkove with yourself, does not mean that you are gay, maybe a little narcissistic, but not gay.
And if he does not, then, render the consequences.
The reason that your are so jealous watching other couples is that you cannot get your own guy!
My grandmother tells this story better.
I made the right choice because I see him once in a while.
They forgot to bring some for me.
Why did they not tell you.
Unles the woman did not care if I slept with others.
The more you think about it, the more you want it.
You should ask the girl to be your date to the dance.
You should find a girl that shares the same interests that you do.
He has a small penis.
I am sorry, but that is disgusting.
Please leave her, go on with your life.
I've heard of friends that start going out and find out they aren't ment to be.
Nope, customer care took it off the answers.  Bummer.
It is a way of showing that she does not want to attract other men.
I do not know. If I were you, I would ask her whether or not she is interested in you.
Be  genuine and do as the first person said: earn some more money because it may be beneficial.
Do you think she should ask the person?
Yes, the buttocks of a man are important in whether or not he is attractive.
The frist kiss sent my head spinning.
He is not cheating.
I want to do the same to her.
Unless they say you are back together, you are not.
Do not appear to be attacking her weight or she will shut down and eat more.
It is incorrect that they said that women commit because of money.
Is the a chance they would like eachother?
If you are being yourself and they do not like you, they do not deserve you.
Your daughter should come first in all areas of your life.
Then, he broke up with me after a few days.
A person who is present when you are happy and when you are sad.
Do I leave or remain here?
Cheer up. Times will become better. Trust me.
Perhaps you become too attached after intercourse and it frightens men into leaving.
Do not fall in love with him.
Where do you live?
You will be her backup.
Even though it might hurt, do what is right.
Some women like to please their man so that nobody else has to do it.
You are creating the issues with him.
I think your best bet is playing hard to get.
Then again there are the homophobics.
I want respect and I want him to be nice to me.
Anyone who doesn't understand, is probably brainwashed.
I stopped a kid from jaywalking across the street in the rain.
I think it is very important.
You should ask him directly if he wants to spend the rest of his life with you.
Just be yourself, and if she doesn't appreciate you, move on.
I would say no. Please be realistic, this is not a chat room.
You will find the one for you.
You do not have to kiss during sex, but you do have to have intercourse.
I belive you should rehome the cat, steam clean the carpets, furniture, bed linenes and then spray for ticks and fleas.
Look the women in the eyes and do not look away.
He believes that she would not cheat on him, however, he is constantly thinking about it.
It depends on the situation.
Hugging him was not the best solution.
Stop letting your husband slack on his responsibilities.
You can fall in love in four months, it has happened to me.
I threw a banana at the screen, and then scratched my head, I'm just kidding.
Go get a breast reduction, and you'll look great.
If they love each other, they will live together.
In the future, don't ask questions that reveal your ignorance of the subject.
My friend often teases me for who I am.
You should move on because time is of the essence.
You could ask her if she is currently having sex with anyone.
She does not want other peopel to gossip.
I made a mistake of proposing to her, and she accepted.
You will never know untill you try.
Comgratulations to him and his bride.
It sounds like no, but what are you asking?
Perhaps, but obviously not enough feelings for her to leave his wife.
All I know is I am with you, there.
I have my own opinions, also.
Sex is serious, making love is fun.
Pray for guidance as people will come and go in your life.
Do not worry, love is not rare.
If he denies it, then he is not cheating.
I talked to him for two hours.
He is not only honest, he is honorable.
He broke up with me.
Basically, tell him what you want - lead him to your solution.
Be honest with yourself and respect who you are.
Also the penis story.
You're not on a trashy talk show.
I'm aware that this is easier said than done.
If you fell in love with a woman, would you fall in love with her personality?
Are you asking, how are you?
The world is full of terrible guys.
It is kind of awkward for him probably.
Ifthat is so, then, why can it not make it?
Life is great, that is the answer!
If he is doing it by choice, then, that should be questioned and watched very closely.
If anyone out there knows this guy, please email me, I miss him!
Ask her whether or not she likes you.
Do not go to your best friends house when he is around unless she is also there.
Of course you should continue if you like him, why would you not?
Do not spend a lot of money.
Also, if you are not ready to become a mother then you need to start protecting yourself from becoming pregnant.
Start from your wedding day.
Forget text messaging him, just call him at home.
Finally, don't listen to these women's advice.
You should give him his walking papers.
She may have left you just for your personality.
Phone sex is an alternative from the original.
Marry her, go to civil court.
Whenever you see her, have her view the best of you.
If you're a woman, dress out and act like a lady.
I am pretty, or so men tell me.
They are not healthy to have around babies. they have diseases.
I think you should write him a note.
Perhaps you should travel to the UK and find out.
I'm married, so I am knowledgable.
No, it will complicate a lot of things.
I don't know why you are asking me this.
If he makes you happy, and you make him happy then be together.
He is the one who does not love you!
I think that anyone younger than 14 or 15 years old, is a dolt.
That is how you know, it just comes to you.
If you do not want to, then stay with your sister.
Are you a guy or a girl?
That was similar to my situation 2 years ago.
If you want to show your appreciation, make if known that you think of them and that you care.
We are married, but she can not concieve a baby.
I would tell him, but he will not care.
It's the inside that's important.
Perhaps she no longer boasts regarding him to her acquaintances, as before.
So he enjoys flirting, as well as attractive.
You enjoy spending time with him, yet you name him creepy?
Heaven knows, let the people be.
Please tell me the possibility to be pregnant in this situation.
There are hot and awesome guys who weight over 250.
Take a hint, she doesn't want you.
A man can work from sun to sun but a woman's job is never done.
Many men are, but all men are not.
You are a threat, but you do not know it, yet.
I would agree with 16.
Of course I would go. I do not have to be a Muslim to attend a Muslim wedding.
You should try speaking to him, first.
Please send me some more info if you need help.
Sorry if I'm no help but we can talk about it if you want.
Yes, you can fall in love after 4 months. It could be.
Tell your friend to tell him you like him.
Since women feel they are mature for their age, why not?
You cannot take the baby back.
It is a beautiful thing to still have your innocence. Do not feel bad about having it.
He needs an incentive, although, you should be the incentive. Some men are rude.
Another girl likes that same guy that I like.  I feel like I do not stand a chance.
Exactly like she did to you.
A woman wants everything from a man.
I am in Junior High School and he is a Junior in High School.
You could always ask him.
A real man would not have to bribe you to kill your child.
You want to be yourself.
When you are both naked and in bed together.
It has to be your choice.
Most of the time, I think about it and say, well, is it honestly my choice?
What is the opposite of above me?
How about all the women who cheat?
A lot of my friends' girlfriends have asked me a similar question.
I agree that man you were asking about was just terrible.
I know it doesn't feel great now, but you will get over him eventually.
Whatever you do, be sure that you do not get caught up in their disagreements.
You have quite an ego.
Are you kidding me?
If you are in love, you will never be bored - that is true love.
I do not want her to die.
Please be careful when you do it.
Would I put myself in danger or a friend or a stranger?
I would be dissapointed if I got that same kiss today.
None of us could think of anything better to do.
I want to befinished with work today and forever!
Flirt with them and say you love them.
Otherwise, it is just something that will eventually lead to love.
Do this either before he leaves or when you first see him.
We'd go for walks and she would whine.
No, because he doesn't really know her if he met her on the internet.
Either he loves you or he doesn't.
Sounds to me like he's already got a girlfriend.
It is not boring to fall in love.
You put in almost all of your effort.
I am going to say yes.
I had a backyard wedding.
I do not think my bottom is like that of a chicken.
Then I am sorry because you are probably stuck in the friend zone at most.
You mean he does not have a reason to hate you?
Smart people aren't just a little too smart.
Last Saturday, I had to pretend to be a women several times.
I am not sure, but I think it is mixed.
Never mind, it didn't work for me.
If you go down that road and leave him later, it would not be good.
If you are under 18 and still in school, you do not want to have sex.
She will break up her current relationship and make a move.
Give her one in front of everyone and see what she does.
He is getting married to a woman, correct?
Maybe one day they will finally be convinced.
Find someone who can make a cake, and there you go!
Should I tell my boyfriend, that I have no interest in being around him?
Why did you leave your home the first time?
Leave him alone, and he will realize your value.
I do not like seeing a woman's ribs, though. My apologies to super models.
All I know is that I am not on the list.
Because most men are liars.
Women can be friends, but not men?
Stop doing that if she is not asking you for any more.
If I tried it that way, I think I would be able to enter her.
What did you do in that class?
It is exciting, especially when he makes you feel the way that you do.
it would take you two months for you to get into the house for the poor.
Just because you are not dating anyone and it seems like everyone else is, does not mean that there is anything the matter with you.
"LOL" is short for "laughing out loud."
The more you give him, the more he will take.
I believe infatuation only means for months.
Depend on the woman. If she likes your posterior, then she will take care of it.
You wouldn't want it just once.
Men like many different things, I know men that like larger women, and some that do not.
Make it look like you'd date her for another reason.
Money is everything.
I am positive he will be satisfied.
Inside pain. Men are not strong, they are tough.
Only if she is more attractive than me.
I want to help but I am too lazy to read it.
Do not try to ignore or be calm.
It is better to wait until you are married because it hurts badly.
Are you serious about your age because I am twenty-five.
You are not her type, and she is also not your type.
Do not let him use you. Think about yourself.
Could you please elaborate and answer me?
The boy will become jealous that you like him and not me.
It should not matter if you truly like her.
The ones given from the heart come from out of the blue.
This girl at my school is nice.
Please recommend me to any that you know of.
I do not want to offend any good men in the world.
My mother's boyfriend and I have disagreements often.
We are not becoming younger, and that is the adventure of life.
I have been socializing with a very attractive man and our relationship is progressing positively everyday.
I suggest standing on a chair or walking on stilts!
If you like sports, then play Volleyball, Basketball, or something similar.
I am the love of his life and he never cheat on me.
I apologize that I did not understand the point.
If you are too shy, try getting involved in things that she likes, even if you do not like it.
She will realize that he made a mistake when she see's how happy you are.
Compliment him on his appearance.
The dresses may take you a month alone.
Do it the same way you've demonstrated towards us!
Your daughter is being irrational, and you should confront her about it.
He didn't take your feeling into account at all.
They will not be allowed into Heaven.
It all depends on other factors, such as your mood.
I am a man, would you like to go out with me?
Well, good luck, and I do hope that he catches on and he does help you out!
Just roll with the punches, and just go with the flow.
You will need to sign in another one every single day with each other.
I only did this because I did not want to feel lonely.
I have a friend who shops at that store for the same reason!
You should stop and think about how that makes you look in front of his friends.
You should try to do a good deed every day.
You are absolutely correct that you did the right thing.
I haven't done that, but I'd either start laughing or get distracted.
I wouldn't want my wife to have an inappropriate affair.
You don't need every girl to like you, just one.
No matter what, stand your ground.
I know a lot of women in the Philippines that met someone online and got married.
Forget him if he is joking about liking you.
I cannot play with him for very long because we have three children under five years old.
My man has a good butt because he works out.
So to look at another woman, and to flirt with another woman is deemed a sinister act?
You sister may have a suitable solution for you problem.
I have a problem with myself.
It isn't necessary, but it is incredibly helpful.
If you have no feelings for him anymore, it is very apparent.
I believe that y9ou need to have a conversation with your cousin.
I believe that it would be popular.
Both women and men are different.
I know a lot of men who act decent.
A girl who has a promiscuous mind set, but is not herself, promiscuous.
They could not stay away from eachother for long.
It will change when you are older.
Are you attractive and stylish?
You are living in a fantasy, not reality.
Thoughts that come to mind while I go to bed.
Don't marry that woman, she is manipulating you.
Most of the woman on campus really don't like him.
People are nervous about that, but I am happy I married him.
In my father's world, there was my mother.
Do not ever be gullible enough to believe such drivel.
There are some rather attractive fifty-year-old men, but why not search for younger men?
The female you are partial towards will be alone, and she states that that is less than desirable.
Then, he attempted suicide, and my unintelligent self went to see him in the hospital.
Kiss that man in front of that woman.
one) If you date beneath you, you will marry beneath you.
This really depends on her.
A woman can be pretty no matter what her size is.
She is going to find out if we go to bed together.
If he still wants to only be friends.
She is promiscuous because she wants men.
Then you can do whatever you like.
Sometimes a smart woman could go for a man who is not as smart as her.
You can not do the thing you are asking about.
There are many guys that are no so honest.
Do you use Yahoo! chat rooms?
Just be yourself, confident and honest. You will see if it meant to be.
That is the best way you can find out.
And I mean this in the friendliest way possible.
Actually falling in love is very nice, until you become aware of reality.
There is no better way than to tell him frankly, but tenderly as well.
Thirty is relatively young to be getting heavier.
As a male, I think it relates to sex.
Is he into sex toys?
Be concerned when he sees someone else.
So what should I do for her?
Hi Proud2blatina29, it's not just for lovers.
When you are truly in love, you would do anything and everything for that person!
Well, it depends on if you still have feelings for her.
Do not pretend to be someone else.
You will not get a positive responce.
Just casually put it out there.
Love is caring for someone what you will never forget.
That song is stuck in my head.
Tell him how you feel, and if he still cannot find the time blow him off.
It is hard to avoid.
Turn ons are a hairy chest and chin.
If I did not have children, I would die for the one I love.
He is nice, but I have to question his thinking skills.
When you know her mind you will know everything.
I would say it is ninty percent yes and ten percent no.
There is nothing wrong with it. Does he join in with you? I would say that if it was three together that would be interesting, otherwise, no.
What type of girlfriend is she? You are attempting to fix the trust, how so?
I know that quitting the school team was a good decision.
Or do you actually love me?
I hope it all works out, whether finding your love, or dating someone new.
If you don't find him trustworthy, then how can you two love each other?
There is still a sense of hope for these young women.
You're just confused, and are not sure what you want in life now.
I am sorry but my intuition tells me no.
However he ignores me when I send him a message.
If it is scary it is not love and I hope you meet the right one soon.
No, I do not think that it is geeky or odd!
Open your mouth and say something!
He is about 147x stronger than an average man.
If you love him so much, then please do.
Get out, and get on with your life.
That was an incredibly hard feeling.
I just met my first love again, we talked to each other openly about guilt, which is great for gifts.
As they say, there is someone for everyone.
I bet you will get him, so good luck.
I cannot because I am starting to fall in love.
You can decide so maybe stop giving in and having sex.
He may be sensitive or just waiting for the right one to come along.
My friend is interested in a man who said he would like to get to know her better.
And you do not need special shoes.
What? Did he say "hold on, I do not love you, I was mistaken"?
I do not think so. Be good.
If they love you, then they will accept you no matter what you do.
You definitely did the morally correct thing.
Approach her and say, "I like you very much. Do you like me?"
Why can you not do it?
But I guess you could always try it if it is worth it to you.
If he needs to kill himself to get over this then so be it.
Keep quiet so you do not hurt his feelings.
If you cannot do that, then maybe you can email him.
I am humbly (and laughingly) stating that I have all the qualities you have mentioned.
Inform him bluntly that it is more preferably to hurt the other person now rather than later.
Alas, it does not concern you.
He genuinely has a massive partiality towards you.
She favors dyeing her hair various colors.
I believe females do it as well.
Do you marry a woman that gives oral sex?
I had a vision that you will get married as soon as you decide to do so.
Some men are like that.
It does not pay to be narrow minded as God does not care about sexual proclivities.
When I saw that word for the first time, my friend told me what it meant.
Why can she not see it even if we all do?
Do not have children if you want to participate in coitus for more than five minutes.
Why not approach her and ask her?
How can I deal with this situation?
Do you know how I overcame it?
Try to ask without any euphemisms.
Men, does this sound familiar to you?
Try it. You might enjoy not being sexually aroused.
Whatever it is that you are saying is correct.
Tell her not to see any bad men.
It is personality that makes women happy.
You did not mention whether your wife has children.
A few hours ago a woman offered to let me spend the night in her home.
Tell him that you love him.
I dislike wearing flats. I will not do it simply to make a man feel better.
You have to want to let go and move on, or you will not be able to.
Be yourself. Keep your tongue in your mouth and knees together.
No, but it would be funny, because I am 6' 2".
No matter how long it will take to them go.
If he still does not want to, just try to be his friend.
Does he care about relatable subjects or not?
Guys are hunters, like dogs. But what they really want is the chase, so I suggest you run.
He wants you to do this so he feels comfortable messing around.
I have had boyfriends enough though I wear glasses.
Women attracted to other women is not unique. Some nourish it, while others allow it to fade over time.
I do not. Although, Homer Simpson is attractive.
I'm aware. I stated that previously.
Men think with their penises and it does get boring.
You cannot stop thinking about the person you love.
Because we only get felatios four times a week!
Thank you for helping to plan my wedding!
Yes, women love it when you are obtuse.
Tell him what you want.
What gets you more jealous?
You did not tell your age. Is there any way to ask him to marry you first and to then think about children?
It is when she infrequently has sex with you.
They are beautiful.
God is happy when two people love one another, regardless of their sex.
If she is fine with her appearance, you should support her.
I will take it, unless I find out I do not really want it.
I would help her if I knew who she was.
Try not to be too set on getting serious.
Do you think he will do it again?
Someone will be there for your good and bad moments.
If I go, should I expect anything from my boyfriend?
Do we get free lunch or fireworks?
You will never have contact with him if you do not reach out to him now.
Good looking gentlemen are usually vain.
They are, at most, five years older than you.
Either one works; I guess it depends on the day and our moods.
In Yahoo! Chat, I communicate quite a bit in that forum.
You lose it if you do not use it.
I do not know how to feel about that, it is not appealing.
Save the heartbreak, and find you a nice guy.
I did quit and joined a recreational team. I had more fun.
If he is married, you should not even be friends with him.
If she asks me and I do not know the answer.
And yes, I have a lot of chances!
Well, I can sympathize. I am in the same situation right now.
Just stay the course long enough so he knows you are not flighty.
If she plays mind games, you need to move on to someone else.
Do you hear yourself?
I guess it depends on whether you have ever committed a felony.
Yes, but I have not met the right person that I would die for.
A woman should like you for you.
I believe it is normal to do it on the phone as well.
Do you actually mean that?
I married a handsome, but mean guy. Eventually, we divorced.
Obesity is the killer of young people.
He says that you do not love him because you have only called him twice.
Tell him that it is over.
Pity does not work.
My boyfriend is similar to a government mule when he farts and belches.
My friend claims she loves me.
Live life to the fullest.
Hang out with them.
Do it if you love him.
Maybe not for anything but for the thrill!
Our family hated that it was an interracial relationship. My father and great grandmother on his side were angry.
Before all of that go get flowers and surprise her with them.
Please do not try that; your life could end.
Just be more passionate with him and he will be yours.
I hope I was of some help.
No, I do not care about my boyfriends.
Seducing a woman is a great feeling and an achievement.
I personally do not really focus on how a man's bottom looks.
You do not, and you just go on with life pretending that you do.
When one hurts you you will have another to fall back on.
Do not be afraid to tell him what you want.
Men like a little mystery in a woman.
There is one less piece of evidence that two people like each other without sex.
If it happens during sex, she isn't a virgin.
The problem is, I am not sure if she feels the same for me.
If he loves you, he would care even if it is just a petty problem.
First of all, that man didn't do anything to you.
He could not have noticed that.
Not really, do you still love him?
This is how my wife keeps my attention.
Tell her to get a life.
What can we do for fun after school?
The world is going to end because you ask daft questions like this one is.
Post Script, I am not criticizing or labeling you.
Do not text and ask, that is faltering.
My man loves me and I hope that your man loves you.
It would look funny, but as long as you two love each other.
Perhaps he just does not feel like talking.
If it is against your religion, then I am sorry, but I do not know what to tell you.
I do not know who you met.
Do not make yourself sound so repulsive and promiscuous. Married men are unavailable.
You just started a large problem.
Some people need some motivation.
Both of you should be understanding and able to adjust.
You want a decent man. Here I am.
It seems that something is having a negative effect on you but don't worry because it will work out.
The meaning of this development is that she is interested in you.
In the vast majority of cases, he is not comfortable wearing the outfits that you like on him.
You might feel better if you tried thinking about another lady.
Boys are more but they hide it because they do not want to look feminine.
I need someone I can really love.
What are you saying because it sees you know nothing about women.
You do not know her style so do not buy a woman clothes unless she picks them out.
If you show her that you love her, and trust her, then , she will love you all the more for it!
I heard some people say that if were to ask God for forgiveness for loving the opposite sex, then, you will be able to enter into heaven in the afterlife.
Just admit that she does not want to go out with you.
Your past should not be the thing to stand in your way if you girl trusts and is in love with you.
Yes, men are stronger physically, I will give you that.
So how do I go about telling them?
Stop asking questions like, "How do I get girls to like me?"!
Well, there could be a reason for this kind of behavior.
List as many as you want.
In time you should know the answer to that.
I have been married three times and have two sons.
Nobody knows. It is ultimately your decision.
If you want to know, then ask her.
Always remember that there are plenty of fish in the sea.
You should go on a date with a guy you like.
Are you asking him if he still finds you attractive?

If you want to cry, cry while talking to her.

If you wait too long, by the time you are ready most women will think that it is strange.
Enjoy life, you live only once.
Has there ever been a woman who you're attracted to, although not enough to be with?
His answer is great.
I did. We're still together two and a half years later.
I believe he didn't, because he feels terrible.

Certain people are unable to exist without it and others are able to.
Correct, so head to that location and examine the surroundings.

It must be an element contained in the water!
Isn't exactly relevant regarding his height, it's concerning the depth of your feelings.
If you claim to be manly, act like a gentleman.
I do not know about love.
They loved each other since ten years ago.
It can hurt, but it is what it was meant to be.
Boys want to become men and men desire women.
Which, of course, angered me greatly.
First, simply embrace him, then look into his eyes and say "I love you" and his name.
You have a right to date as well as to proceed with your life.
An age difference of nine years is not bad.
If she loves him, she will wait.
It is not for you.
V6, JJ, and I go to school with him.
Observe his how he acts.
Men like to date younger women, I am not dating a woman my age.
Maybe his wife doesn't initiate intercourse as she did in the past.
Make her realize that she is too important to you and that you are someone who she can love very much.
Smile before you look away so the woman does not think you find her unattractive.
I am intelligent, but I do not think I am intelligent enough for him.
That means you enjoy seeing yourself.
I hate to say so, but it will become worse after you get married.
However, if that is not the case then he was not worth the trouble.

I gave my soul away to a one-sided love.

There is no way to acquire that information.
It could just be a strong emotion, not love.
I had one date with this man, who seemed nice when I spoke to him on the phone.

Do not simply hand it to her.
That is not the case provided you are both adults.
If you ask for her telephone number and she does not give it to you, she does not like you.
Tell the person that you love her in any event.
If he does not provide a direct answer or acts evasively, you know what you must do.
How long have you been with her?

If he likes her, he should not be mad.

I have learned that if a guy really likes you, he will show it.
Okay, been there, done that sweetie.
I have too much to live for to give up on my life.
Who or what can I turn to for help?
I think you should tell him that you must respect your best friend and that he should respect you.
For a date, you should take him to a good bar where you can play darts and pool.
You are mature and attractive enough.
No contact, merely an interest. Must I forget it?
Either that or be slightly flirtatious.
Of course, because I would not be capable of living with her death.
Do not hurt her. Good luck, and remember there are many men in the world.
It depends, I personally like the position from behind.
What happens if the relationship doesn't work.
You two should be very active in bed.
Girls are just too paranoid about many topics.
Perhaps the love was not very much when you got married, you merely thought it was.
Then you can do these activities together.
Give me your input, because I dislike Valentine's Day.
Be genuine and enjoy whatever you like.
No, only if you also want your friend to watch.
We have phone sex ever day, I never grow tired of it.
No, but it can make it a lot worse!
Treat him just like you would treat a good friend that you have not seen in a long time.
If you are her true friend, you will not even consider it.
I have almost reached the point where I no longer care about giving it a shot.
No, however, if you are in love, sex is a totally different experience.

The speed of the relationship depends on how long you have been talking.
I feel that they should get married at this time.
My girlfriend is crazy about the bottom thing.
Do not be overly possessive. Allow him some freedom because men enjoy freedom.

Maybe you are into the bad boy stereotype?
Men don't like being told what to do.
Want to come sit on my cock?

I am very much so, in my darling's eyes.
It is only worth it if both of you can wait.
I used to be that way, but, not anymore.
You will never get any peace of mind having him around you.
Forget about him. Do not go out of your way to make him believe you are over him.
I hope not, I have enough trouble with homosexuals checking me out.
It means she likely would not have left you if you would have calmed down back then.
Maybe you married the wrong man?
Yes, but I hope I never have to.
Women want it more and men are saying no.
You do not want to spend the rest of your life wondering what if.

A great kisser is nice, but so is great sex!
My friend has no idea how hurt she has left me.
You have to be straight forward.
If he loved you, he would not have wanted you to have an abortion.
If you are in love, you should get on a plane and elope.
You need to relax for a while.
I have never dated a guy who does not have a great body.
What a tangled web we weave, when first, we practice to deceive.
Why do you not ask him to go out?
I personally would want my daughter to be a lesbian, because I know what men are like.
Then it would not be breaking the law, because you will be holding her for ransom, instead of dating her.
Ask a question. You might receive an answer rather than points.

You ask her and she should tell you honestly.

I guess I do not really get too concerned about it.
He is an inspiration but though I want to get close I do not want to get involved so please help.

Seriously, the best way, is to just tell them.
Just ask about it, if you cannot tell on your own.
Tell your parents that you love them and then move on.

Men merely want sincere and caring women who can accommodate them in life. That is it.
Because they feel as though their husbands do not need them.

Open it and ask her the way you did here.
I am unaware of that specifically.
Think of where her favorite places are.
None of the above, ask my about any type of man, and I have an answer for you.
I don't want to sound rude, but it sounds as if he may have a problem with commitment.
I am having a terrible day as well.
