Now the devils hell hounds are tracking his every step.
Tell her to get a life
You can't do what you are asking.
As long as he really doesnt know the chicks it wont matter...
he will love you so much more ...
My wife gave me a kiss and took off with the kids.
My e-mail is jakb6hsm@yahoo.com  I like new friends
i dunno.. maybe i'm just not born 2 lie 2 much.
so thats why i went with matt.
Some places to go to: beaches, restaurants,...etc.
it doesnt mean he doesnt love you.
Sounds like he's playing hard to get...and you aren't.
I like it from the back!!!!!!!!
Hell, the other Saturday morning, I had to pretend to be a shemale like 6 times!
well... if he doesn't even know who you are it looks really hard... but it is worth trying
Knock that bastard upside his head.
You need to get a job if you asking questions like that.
oh God, try talking to him first.
And I don't really think too much about it.
BUT EVERYTIME I GET BACK ITS THE SAME CRAP OVER AGAIN.
if she likes you then she should know that your new at it.
yes you should, give him his walking papers.
I asked her to dance and we are now friends.
call her and tell her how much you love her
u r jus experiencing new things which is a gud thing.
no everything everyone else said is true also.
if you dont use it, you lose it
someone else might take the opportunity.........DON'T BE LATE.
yes it is but are you in love?
But he tells me that they dont mean anything to him.
have someone else tell him for you.
he must have been a friend at one time.
ask from ur sister she give sutiable answer to u
depends if ur a guy or a girl LOL
are u implying there is something not good about me???!
earth try it i hear there are a lot of girls there!
MOVE ON girl@ go have fun!
If u really like her it shouldnt matter at all.
Why should she miss anyone who in the first place wasnt hers?
they can never be what you are.
they dont see them, they feel them
I wouldn't worry about things like that!
its exciting, especially when you have the butterflies in your stomach!
I'm male, so it must be sex...
?/ Why men are stronger ant tougher and more honest and resposible, and hardworking?
a question that left you busting up laughing
DOn't marry that girl at all, she is using you.
good luck buddy you will need it.
no, don't ask him, instead push his buttons so that he asks you out.
and look at pictures of guys.
he wants a break, your boring him or he's haviing sex with someone else
Please ,don't do this,you deserve nmore.You can  but don't.
I dunno cuz me and my fiance are like that to.
love her, trust her, she will love u all the more for it.
Im soooooooooooo loud we got complaints from our neighbors... no joke
well he wont be married much longer.
I have same idea with westling
you will know....you will feel it!!!
YES IT IS THE FRENCH THAT EVERYONE WAS USING...BUT THIS ALSO WORKS...
So if you find the answer let me know.
other than that, there should be no reason why you shouldn't go out with him.
listen to your mind and heart.
Jealousy is a heck of a demon to fight.
I think it would be cool.
Honey, trust me I am a guy.
and definitely consider asking ur older sis again.
Read this article and say whatever you can to stop her!!!
my old man don't he just go right to it and get in it
click on my avatar and check out my questions ...they r like identicle!!
He got waaaay too many girl friends help me im confused!!
I believe being with someone is the best!
Or, one day, slap him with a kiss!
I want to get back with him so bad.
At least he wants you involved in it!
seducing a woman it's a great feeling, an achievment.
tell him to go to hell!!!!
buy her a rose bouquet for v-day and ask her out.
You don't actually have to ask her to be your girlfriend.
if he is hot and you really like him, i would but that's my opinion know you decide
If it's DURING sex she's NOT a virgin!
erkannss14@hotmail.com add me and we talk this subject later
Not even free lunch or fireworks.
I just like to get some advice.
look you just have to be normal.
how can I go and talk to her??
Don't text and ask, that's lame!!
Just don't go overboard with all your planning!
afterall she has lived her life all these days jus 4 u...
and this is the first time I ever had to do anything like this for anyone..PLEASE HELP ME!
no...why can't a guy talk to another girl without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating?
I was chatting wit a guy 2 hrs.
you are such green minded people!!!
that jus means u like to see ur self
No matter what stand up for your self.
the same reason most women are stupid!
don't try that , plz your life will be ended
I want to so bad but I don't just want to do it.
if its a different one each week i doubt it... but check the signs: eye contack and flirting
sweetie, love conquers all...what are you so worried about?
trust me i am a relationship dr.
If i like a guy i ask him out before another girl out him out.
but that takes time to develope.
Remember bill gates was probably dateless and considered ugly and stupid and look at him now.
god is happy when 2 people love each other- regardless of their sex.
men want ladies out in public, and sluts at home in the bedroom.
dunno, cook him dinner, show him u care.
well ask him or ask ur friends that know him and they might know.
Take a hint, she doesn't want you.
Ain't the size kiddo, it's how u use it.
no i don't care about my boyfriend's.
Go out with one of his friends and see how he takes it...
youhave some work to do there.
What can i do with her for fun after school?
have a serious talk with and tell her that it is childish and you are getting older.
we are better liers than guys are...
they end up thinking you`re a total bastard.
Then see if he still wants to be around.
You just cannot force yourself on anyone or you will not have anyone.
But don't be like are you a virgin.
well i think you should introduce your self.
I'll try anything once and again if I like it
as for what to do... dont DO anything.
older as in 3 - 5 yrs so he's alot matured
Do you really want to spend the rest of you life with someone like that.
I say.... that whatever your instinct tells you is happening....is happening.
don't be dumb and stupid, be average in intelligence.
beside now this days its hard to find a virgin!
its basically deciding who i want to marry.
Both is nice...Just depending on what kinda Mood/or Day we are all having =)...
he lies to me and hangs up in my face.
And just do it, if yo wait you will never get anywhere.
is he ruining his life or what?
Nope, but who is really happy anyway?
what do you like bieng asked?
everything reminds me of him and wat used to be.
here i expect he will go to jail even though you say it was mutual.
i can fall in love after one month.
if u dont trust him then how can he loves u or u love him.
why my ex b/f keeps tryin to make me jealous..
whats the worst thing they can say?
rent everything and have one of your family members take pictures and recordings.
she might do it agin oh and thanks i'll let him know.
I guess I don't really get too concerned about it.
r u and ur spouse still together?
You might not like it but pretend to.
Find some Barry White stuff, it works.
then you don't have a relationship.
I am a 20 yo female.
BUT TO MUCH OF A GOOD THING CAN TURN IN TO A BOTHER.
and u just wanna be urself.
if u want to cry while talking to her cry.
It's about the one you're with.
become a friend to a women first.
If i got that same kiss today i'd be very dissapointed.
my love... aka my girlfriend aka my everything aka shes perfect...
friends are hard to come by..
i know my ex did me the same way.
so i guess a little of both
be yourself and see what happens
Anger makes you say YOU CAN'T HURT ME ANYMORE!
go and have ur breast treated and get them reduced and look sexy
That you aint getting none homie
I wouldnt dump my girl over those I have gotten nude pics from.
don't run he is just talking.
cheat on you then write a note.
let him be, he's not for you, he's giving you bad advice.
I see him once in a while and I made the right decision.
a 23 year old guy tht never had intercourse with any girl!
well it depends on if you have feelings for her still.
stop having sex with him which you should not be doing in the first place....
it is ok to like him even though others do not.
He even slept with his best friends wife.
they r so beautiful and lovely
and what does it stands for?
who can put me back together
Unless your best friend is suggesting this to you I say no way.
dont care about them just leave them cz trust me u wont get anywhere with these people
My problem is, I always see others as the way I want to see them...
and the only reason i did that is because i didnt want to feel lonely.
Iam Sure They Think The Same Thing About Girls.
Not all gals, but some do.
if they dodge the question and/or get angry then i would be worried.
Listen, if he loved you to begin with he wouldn't of wanted you to have an abortion!
What did he say 'oh hang on, I don't love you, I was mistaken.
If I could arrange the alphabet I would put U next to I.
why do men lie so much?
if she wants to play mind games its time to move on to the next luv interest
Shower, wear deodorant & always have fresh breath...
Try looking someplace besides the losers section.
don't do something u'll regret later!
marrying the lady of my dreams would mean that i have everything i dreamed of.
i have been to a few.
I have gone out with big guys.
I don't think MOST guys are stupid.
well mine is 8 to 9 inchs
when a girl likes u, u should be able to kno HELP ME GIRLS!!!
You know what you want, don't you?
If he says bye to you,  he was not meant to be.
Haven't you seen the Paris Hilton video YET?!!?!
i need somebody that i can really care for
both of u should be understanding and be able to adjust.
Like peach fuzz is ok, but not hairy like a mens chest can get.
let your family know that person makes you happy.
if she's fine w/her apperance, u shld support her.
Um...I didn't...I let the man come to me and ask me out!
The guy is married for god's sake!
tell them you love them, and see if they tell you back
you have ever right to be mad
do you really want someone that doesn't know what he wants?
my friends can't stand him and constantly picks on him.
YOU ARE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH!!!
but, to make this person stay with u is a dificult part.
so just go ahead and text!!
i say right on to being a virgin it is a really big sin to not be a virgin.
ok he is 14-16 and you are how old??
happy u r. mature and attractive enough.
don't ya love it when a man does that s-hit?
And it cant be all hairy.
Find someone  who wants there future with you!
He loves you for being HIS only!
He probably thinks it's a good thing.
turn offs: bad breath, body odor and farting and belching a lot.
BooHoo for me because I still think of him.
ask him to hang out with you, then start moving in on him and see how he responds.
different times for different ladies, chump
Trust me you can't change them!
in no way do you need him or anyone bring you down.
I know he loves me even more because I was still a virgin on our wedding night!
if you truly feel in love, you should get on a plane and elope with them.
Looking at a masturbated woman is enjoyable, after she finish it i will directly have sex with her
you shoud tell her how you feel
Women can be friends, but men can't....................
just be a cool guy, don`t take girls for granted.
somewhere inside yourself you are strong and that will make him weak!
or shell break it off to make a move.
If so how many years have you been married?
ask him if he likes your kids if he dont thin brack up beceas family comes 1st.
maybe my mother, but that's another story!
Would I pack my husband's bags?
ive actually heard alot of guys say that thye prefer virgins.
And you have a problem with this?
i dont live there so couldnt tell ya sorry
if you are with an unsaved (sinner) you are a sinner too.
Go to movies, sight seeings etc.
So we always meet and I feel like him.
tell her there's something you've been wanting to tell her.
If I wanted it, I wouldnt only want it once.
he did it one time he do it again????????????
Then u distract her and bail out!
I care about him a lot, and I miss him.
if its something you enjoy then whats wrong with that?
But I hope not, I have enough trouble with gays making googley eyes at me on earth.
my friend told me that she really loves me.
she might have an underlieing factor that makes her eat this much ?
Hey guys, does this sound familiar to you?
They Just want to be loved
I want her, to want me....
OUR FAMILY HATED THE FACT THAT IT WAS A INTERRAISAL RELASIONSIP MY FATHER AND HIS GRANDMOTHER LOST IT .
i mean beauty is skin deep!
because red is blody color but we sey blue is LOVE
Be honest ....with him, and yourself,do you really want him back?
You urinate from there, and don't even wipe!
u better leave his a$$ u can do bad all by yoself!!
Dat was bad....... never again TV will be on during Sex.
u will prove to be a great sis!!!
then one day he started flirting with me.
because the boys get gelles that you like hin not me
Its So natural, why make issue out it?
REPEAT DONOT TELL HIM FACE TO FACE.
and to top it all off, i didn't get to come, cuz that headboard thing lost the whole mood.
But oops.. Now I really love my wife very much.
if they do, then ask him to hang out.
I am 26 and I waited until I was married to have sex.
do they feel like he doesn't have confidence or something
he wouldn't think twice about NOT using a condom).
do you think she'll know that you like her without telling her?
I can't caz i m on the way to love.
Yeah, because chicks love it when you're obtuse.
a person is there when u are happy and when u are sad.
then you can do these things together!
It's SIMPLE.... just don't do it.
if you have tried to hard!
A MAN CAN WORK FROM SUN TO SUN, BUT A WOMENS JOB IS NEVER DONE!
because that description surely screams FLIRTING!!!!!!
THE GIRL YOU LIKE is going to be alone and she says that sucks.
I like him but..im not in love with him.
I doesnt matter if u do it right!
Cauze if you never give it a chance u will never know what would had happen between yall 2.
Don't be afraid to tell him what you want!!!
...you're starting to hate the male/female friends of the one you love.
but u know how i overcame it???
Love isn't bad...you should try it...
some guy was following me in a store and said i never liked levi's jeans until now, i ran.
and dear as i believe sex is to b done to give satisfaction not to get.. unselfishly.
tell her if she loved you she would come over and fuck your brains out and swallow your kids
Kinda like suicide... normal to think about, but not to do.
My guy friends all say confidnece (not arrogance though) is sexy.
if he loves you, he'd care even it's just a petty things.
I cant stop thinking about him.
Get ideas off of the knot website.
What is your problem your aready maried!
he will ask you to marry him.
they want a man just to be himself, at least I do
Then  you can do whatever you like
The ones just out of the blue are TRUELY given FROM the heart!!
yeah, the woman I love is worth worth death, if she died I wouldn't want to be alive anyway.
if he doesn't, kick his butt.
I know he wouldn't want me to either!
Girl, don't TELL him you want to make love to him!
When he starts seeing someone else
As far as the love thing i dont know.
Iam humbly stating....I HAVE ALL THE ABOVE qualities...hahaha!!
Well, like I wouldn't necessarily just drop my friend like just because we fight.
that is where i talk alot in yahoo chat for my state.
get used to guys that just want to use you.
hook up with math geeks, they know how to handle curves :-)
A not circumcised penis is pretty nasty!!!!
You wake up and one day just know.
I'm married, trust me I know.
no but you should take care of it before you try to get preganant
If he is trying to control you - GET OUT!!
I don't know about you but I don't like the bad boy type.
If they love you they will accept you no matter what!
god doesn't care, love is love.
Thats not very fair to the guy your seeing now.
I hate those kind so remember money can buy lots of things apart from class, style and grace
depends on the size of the penis
it that true i tryed taking to him but he wont return my calls.
my guy has an awesome butt because he works out.
I wouldn't doubt him, just maybe.
try raising yourself.. he is not oblige to feed you!!
if all you want is to be with him, stay with him.
and just ask him, it might be awkward but it will be worth it if he does love you.
if ur in bangalore i am here :)
Always happy...waking up this morning...at work now.
You need to ask YOURSELF if you like him!
stop doing this then if she is not willing
but i've learned that if a guy really likes you, he'll show it.
then you will no her if or when your feelings change.
I have guy friends that are like brothers to me and there's no tension whatsoever.
Or like what you did for class....?
i don't know...if i were you, i'd ask her whether or not she likes you
i mean.how insensitive of her to do those things infront of you!!duh?
I am always into the A-Hole guys, Whats my problem?
LAST recourse, CLING and PRAY TO JEHOVAH GOD and to HIS SON JESUS CHRIST!
hang around with her,go shopping if she likes it,.
I garantee that all the girls that think they think about sex a lot have no effin idea.
That will cost you 3 points per answer :)
I think its a big myth that guys are just big, retarded sex fiends.
leave him alone he got what he wanted and maybe don't want to talk to you anymore
I need advice from other ppl.
Sending money is NOT better, your kid wants YOU there!!
dont jsut wait for something good to happen.
we are married but still she cant conceive...pls advise..
My wife said it just depends on her mood at the time
twice first one i met and wanted to marry right then, the second is still unravelling.
i know alot just email me and i will tell you
You said it yourself hes in love with another lady!
Believe in yourself...it is very SEXY!
Because there head is not on their shoulders!
but try to stay out of this till time makes them calm;) Good Luck
many men are totally happy just keep sex interesting and exciting and he will never even consider it
otherwise if you slowly appproach...her body language will let you know
a lot of attention and to be fed some good chocolate.
I don't really even like the word stupid .
Depends on how old are you
if you love others, they will love you back
Him asking you out is up to him, you blew it.
I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL HIM THAT YOU HAVE TO RESPECT YOUR BEST FRIEND AND HE SHOULD RESPECT YOU.
You get out what you put in (no pun intended)
I guess it depends.... have you ever committed a felony?
how much success you get in your life and you find love is the reason for that success
pretend to be a girl looking for a NSA relationship and IM him..:P
because when you are into a relationship, and if you go out for fun... this kills your partner.
All i really want is my ex to realize that i only want him.
dam thatz a real hard feelin.
Some guys really dont like any playing with their bums.
Most people don't believe in it until they fall, and fall hard.
Don't you really mean, how many minutes into the first date????
Not all guys care only about sex.
well there may b some reason 4 such a kind of behaviour .
I dont think i have a chicken butt.
No, I'm a girl, I only think about sex if I'm realy in love of some guy
if he has friends though then maybe he likes you.
I am not sure but if you find mine, let me know cause I want it back.
he already cheated your cousin and i think he will cheat in you some other time.
u r not considered unless u do it back in return.
I miss him.... if anyone out there know this guy please email me.........
i mean, because what's a relationship if you can't talk to each other about stuff like that?
I don't think it's a sin, but it surely ends in fornication!!!
But if you decide to go for it....HAVE FUN!
it sounds like you're more hung up on virginity than most guys would be.
i loved my boyfren of 8 years.
Boy, what an eye opener for me.
or what do you think about marriage?
Can I get custody even though he has been a stay at home dad?
i think you got a boyfriend.
they're happy, so it could work for you too!
they used to be best friends, but now they arent.
but we never got together, because i was with his best friend *matt.
he even accepted my newborne daughter as his own.
Don't spend a lot of money.
well then recognize what you dont want to
Or if you're too shy, get involved in things she likes, even if you hate it.
Sounds a little fishy to me...think she's got something to hide??
all depends on so many factors, such as mood...
most guys, as you probably know, are horny all of the time.
are u matuer enough to handle a serious relationship?
give her one in front of everybody and see what she does
did you just read what you wrote.
nobody can do it better than you
in the meanwhile continue to flirt, care or adore him and better still know him!!
most of tha time i think about it and say well is it REALY my choice !
no matter how long it will take to let them go.
I can lend you a few!!
should i break up with her or go with it and trust that she really loves me ?
tell her while in a middle of a conversation to surprise her
i dont believe that love dies so fast.
i like him but i don't know if he likes me.
but I may whant it more then guys.
Shall we say, put urself in there shoes.
what the hell should i do?
Everything, a woman wants everything from a man!!!
hit me up if u want more... digital_lyricist at yahoo dot com.
dude same here.. but i don't think its a bad choice...
she's realised what shes thrown away, and can see how happy you are.
only 1, the first and the last
Because once you cross the friendship line it's really hard to go back to that!
the admiration s not enough reason to kiss
if it hurts, and the woman can't take it, it's way to long.
You can't train 'em to put the toilet seat down and you SURE can't change their minds!
He just wants you to do this so he will feel comfortable messing around as well!
doesn't mean he's puttin' the moves on elsewhere but I would be suspicious !
No,  I am not soft, just trying to be fair.
it's a way 2 show u that she doesnt want 2 attract any other guys..
yes he is a MAN that is what we do!
I gave him a second chance but he didnt take.
he will get jealous and when he does tell him that you dont like how he does that too!
May-b you become clingy after sex and it scares men away.
Honey, if you don't want to have sex with a guy, that's o.k.
Why would you care, as long as you got yours...right?
I guess things can get lost but memories... well is little harder to  get rid of them ;)
hello how are you?what you neam?i just want friend in  amsterdam please send to me sincarely shaba
its probably that woman don't like wussies!
im not sure but you have to be careful.
Some men just don't function the same.
be yourself and if they dont like you for that they dont deserve you
If he/she really made u happy u would be glad to sayback off not flirt.
it's very easy just buy him a flower and say that you love him
Not really, do you still love him?
Keep your boyfriend, but find a LOVER!
SInce you mom kicked you out, she has no say anymore.
it's the only thing real serious ladies are serious about.
lol I supposed you've tried talking to him?
If he want to just be friends , it's best to move on.
Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
If they r not, why would be so mean?
If u have an he still continues to do it then let him go u dont need that!!
hugging him was probably not the best solution, lol.
YEAH, BUT I HAVEN'T MET THE RIGHT PERSON WHICH I WOULD DIE FOR YET.
I am really mature so don't mess with me!
and why did they not tell you.
one was wolf the other a very large lab
But send the ole boy a post card from Bora Bora or something.
you are going to find someone else and wonder why you forgave this guy so many times!
well if you wanna meet some hot mama citas i would go to the library or maybe walmart.
Yeah its possible...it happens a lot to me
And you really want him to ask you to marry him
when a girl looks at you, she is testing you.
Thanks for helping plan my wedding!
the more that you keep giving him the more he is gonna take.
You should try it some time you will not be dissapointed
get a younger guy for god's sake.
no, drop dead girl who dumped me....I even won't give a damn to her anymore....
Isn't it torture for one and ego for the other ...
it really depends on the situation...
I BELIEVE A WOMAN SHOULD MAKE HER OWN DECISSION.
secret admirier notes,with clues leading up to you
Any guy that's not completely desperate won't ask you out again if you dumped him.
plz tell me  the possiability to be pregnant in this satuation
then tell him that if he's interested, u could go out sometime.
a compromise position is to refuse to hang out with her when she's been drinking.
I found out my gf was really a boy.
just be friendly not fwd i.e.
Hey guy, I've seen you on a CD, havent I, and I like famous singers!
life is like that, everyone hurting each other.
They got to be in the mood for love and let it ALL go!!!
I would tell him straight up,he probably won't care anyway.
we've been talkin 4 5 mnths.
Hope you get some new friens soon...
!LOL WHEN I WENT OUT THERE I NOTICED THAT TOO.
no, but that is because guys have different horomones than girls do.
oh not to mention a cute A$$ and small boobies ( ya as weird as it is!
how im gonna handle to stop being a jealous girlfriend?
IF  ALONG TIME YOU SHOULD NO THE ANSWER TO THAT .
its not your fault they are very weak minded .
Where does the baby's daddy fit in?
why would he go to jail?
The phrase to use is, Hey, I got enuff friends
you won't meet anyone too serious unless you got a big dick.
As long as that person  says it's OK.
MY FRIEND HAD NO IDEA HOW SHE RUINED ME.
Just move on with your life and find someone else.
Guys can have female friends too -
I`m sure he will be happy.
Stare at that for a bit.
pity doesn,t get you into these panties.
is having sex with your boyfriend something normal?
But it does not do anything with you.
you should make the first move
who knows it's all up to you in the end.
nope.unless they actually SAID we're back on, then nope.
she's not interested, or maybe you came on too strong.
NO i DON'T THINK THAT IT'S WEIRD OR GEEKY!!
you can't stop thinking about the person youre inn love with
your a 40 year old woman you should look for someone your around age
As they get  married they syart acting stupid and abusive.
i would think that he is having sex with someone eles.
it just depends on how it is.
I'm a boy, wanna go out with me?
Hi proud2blatina29, It's not just for lovers.
now, would i put myself in danger for a friend or stranger...?
what was this all about, i'm curious now?
you try to take it slow, no guy like to hear that he is a bad kisser.
IT CANT BE DONE,IF THEY CARE ABOUT YOU ITS GOING TO HURT NO MATTER HOW YOU SAY IT.
we get to know eachother better
The boy is 14-16 years old and he likes me.
It might be hard, but try to act like you don't want it.
so just make sure she knows how much you love her.
What are indications of a man flirting?
you ask her and she should honestly tell you.
flirt with him/her and tell her you ove her/him
move on - time is essence
When he screams Where's my razor?
It means she probably wouldn't have left you if you would have chilled out back then.
dump him...your wasting your time if you stay with him
and neither of us could think of anything better to do!
My sister has dumbed him since then but she is pregnant with his baby.
get her things that actually mean something.
when she not asking you for any, any more!
Oh forgot a big one for you ladies.....ever use the sample cosmetics at the mall?
there is still hope for these young girls
Don't say that because most guys arent stupid.
Yet I will not date a large man.
no, i know jim he is.
When she slacks off sleeping with you !
Dont give him sex for a while - make him go nuts!
But why would he ignore me??
then, i learned that he likes me.
I get hungry twice a day.
just ask her she'll probably like you to have some help
In places where there are black men...duh!
by the way, all those commercials saying, condoms don't always protect, well, something is better than nothing!!
can u check it out for me plz die fast
She might be able to fake moaning, shaking, thrashing around, etc., but she can't fake that.
but this really depends on her.
but only when theyare in the mood or if you spice the moment.
Best revenge: move on with your life and forget that the cheater ever existed.

Keep it that way no matter how mad she gets.
sometimes it dosnt matter if you no how to use it.
we try to make females comfortable.
and that he has a tiny wiener.
what kind of girlfriend is she?..ur trying to fix the trust, how?
especially if your used to having sex on a regular basis.
cuz they have a one track mind
U can tell him anytime.He'll probably do that if he isn't gay

HOW CAN I TELL IF THE MAN IM WITH TRUELY LOVES ME
ur question is making ppl able to know that u r single.
or im just scared or shy!
But be extra careful, you're playing with fire!
it hinders u from doing fun thigns with people.
yes, I guess I like the thugish type of guys.
Girl, it's not going to last, go out and have fun!
undress yourself infront of him u will know
If you know any, please recommend me,  Thanks
At least that way I'd get into her.
no one knows this girls intentions if she really loves him she will wait.
Ive asked her to be my girl friend 2 times already but she never answers.
it's all the inside that matters
Do married woman still givee head?
But it has to be up to you.
But i will expect her to do the same..So just get with better guys....
if you can't take it to be his friend then leave him alone
yes, and it can last forever if you work at it and grow with it.
do things that makes you happy.
Really good looking men tend to be vain.
i just broke up with my gf but its harder to get another one can u help me
my dad is like that too.
Im pretty or so guys tell me.
She knew I was there & I love her.
she really looks up to u and thinks of you as a friend and probly nothing more
?i think infatuation is only for months...
i think it depends on hwo mature the child is.
does anybody know what love is any more.
unless I found out I didn't really want it.
EVERYONE WANTS THE PERFECT GUY BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO BE   WILLING TO BE ONE.
Only if she's twice your age.
Who is more important to you??
she knows she has to move on but she can't....any ideas that might help her out?
Good luck and I hope he catches on and asks you out!
there is no way to know
it does not mean good things for you as far as dating her goes.
but hes as clueless as i am.
This is a major NO, NO!
You didnot tell your age ,any way ask him to marry you first then think about kids
Depends on if you are a girl too or not.
Ank one other thing, trust her.
Unless if you like being treated like poop.
it is never boring it's actually fulfilling
im 28 years old.im almost handsome.
You don't know what real problems are until you get married and have kids!
and why do the girls there have facial hair?
NO THEY CANT BECAUSE SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN THERE IS A ATTRACTION,,,,,,,,
Okay, so he likes to flirt and he's good looking.
where do i go for help?
A girl who loves him and cares about him.
If this guy says no he won't help.
chear up..things will get better,,trust me..
YOU ARE YOUNG ....YOU NEED TO TALK TO YOUR MOM ABOUT THAT...
keep quiet why hurt his feelings
unless they really want it as much as you do.
My girlfriend is crazy about this butt thing.
mabie you married the wrong guy ?
2.If a guy cheats you are hanging out with the wrong men.
guy: im a caveman girl:whats this?
if you love him so so much then please do
i would have to agree with 16
Oh, and as good as it may sound, dont do anything for Valentines Day!
But smart peeps aren't a lil too smart.
SHE OR HE WILL GET IT.
relax, do it and think that's not the best point in your life.
So thats ur answer yes they say that wont cheat....
and crying is ok....but talking is more productive.
it means they love you and want u back
I also like kids...but I'm not one.
U are making issues with him.
no dear its not a good idea untill and unless u get a perfect partner
no phisical contact, no eyes contact, no hand contact, just the faith that the other one says the truth...
till him that you love him
if a guy/gal can't be honest with you then forget him/her!!!!
but sometimes he acts like he still does.
Have u cheated on her in the past?
if ur hot also comment on her hair,outfit,or her shoes.
Well if a guy does that to me, I just move on.
Depends on the man OF COURSE!
you just answered your own question.
if you feel like he is chancers are he  is.
to show their apreciation and to make it known that they think of you and they care for u.
2 months if you want to go in the poor house.
dont stick with someone who isnt right for you, its just not worth it.
mayb its cuz ur doin something wrong!!
get rid of anything having to do with him
Especially if u are looking to get married and settle down.
If you have money to spend, girls usually love jewelry!!
The least she could say is no.
trust me u'll get asked out soon enough.
NO, I THINK YOU CANT SPELL.
one get divorced...duh  two, prove other lady is a stupid ho, then ur done...
It's cool that you like this girl.
you dont know... that's why they call it love (confusin aint it)
Because after all i'm in your school.
i understand that u feel as though shes not as attractive, but shes happy bout the way she feels.
Now if you can't say this to his face scream it in the mirror with him not around...Know why?
And you already had sex with this man.
beause they dont think with the head on their sholders.
this guy and i got really close this past few weeks.
just like most of the time guys dont understand girls.
I think you just lust for him.
never mind, I tried it doesn't work.
then it wont be breaking the law because youll be holding her for ransom instead of dating her
the way she reponds will tell you if she right for you or not.
I THINK ITS A GOOD THING.... TO TRY THE MILK BEFORE YOU BUY THE COW .....
something that happened behind your back.
If my sister's friend shit on ME I would leave the room immediately!
Never buy a women lingere unless it is something she wants.
How to check that I am madly  in love with her ...?
try to smile before you look away so you don't make the girl think you think shes ugly :)
Well, if he only kind of likes her then he shouldn't get too mad.
first of all, are you sure that she really loves you?
what ever you decide.. quit giving in and having sex
first of all she,s not much of a best friend, keep your eye on her.
maybe because you are differant than every one else!
get with somone more in tune with your maturity level
well, i feel you on this one, cuz i'm goin thru the same thing right now.
They don't do anything for me....
I see her terribly upset - what can we do?
And take a good look in the mirror.
but now he ignores me again.
go out with your mates and have a great time!
Try saying  What if we got married one day?
go to the gym - workout practice speaking with a lower your voice be confident
try a card if you cant just say i love you
because all men love to compete.
Lot thoughts coming while going to bed.
Also tell him you had a bad experience with another guy that tried some stuff and made you mad.
god moves in many ways ?
don't have sex w/ him and see what he does...haha great advice i know!
you never have to ask... look him in the eyes..see to his heart and soul and you will know...
of course way would u ask me that question that means your 1
He needs to see what it's like firsthand.

i knew it is hard but is better for you.
Wouldn't she leave if she didn't love you?

I hate to say it, but its going to get worse once you're married.
I am an old fashioned kind of guy.
oh, um, well it depends on your relationship.
And of course stop & say hey!
you dont want to lose him as a friend.
simply because u only put 90% of ur effort.
we think we are giving them signals but they dont get it.
IF these don't WORK OUT, LEAVE things as they were, and START ANEW in a DIFFERENT DIRECTION!
I like the woman to be loud though!

I know, it's easier said than done.
Stop thinking about looks and start looking at people on how they treat u
if he gets too possesive send him packing.
if you have back pain, get a breast reduction.
Just be yourself and like the first guy said, a little money wont hurt anyone.
hey, i am 12 and just got a girl friend.
it's just the way of life
i will say wait till she's ready to wear a bra.
Asking him if he still finds you disirable?
he will b pleasently suprised and will luv all the more for it:)
why don't you just email him your question?
Dont push her or tell her you love her.
you sneeky bugger..i was just going to ask this question.
something unique and not ridiculously pricey?
yes it is beneficial to not have sex.
Never can be if ur a teen or kid or something........
WHAT IN GODS NAME ARE YOU DOING.
there not the kind of guy you want.
if you like a man talk to him and get to know him
i heard once it was not.
U are just jealous of those other people holding hands and making out because you can't get a guy!!!
maebi that's just hu he is.
DONT TELL HIM FIRST, GO TO YOUR MOM OR SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKER AND LET THEM TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.
your damb right you did the right thing!
hook/ kiss up with the guy in front of that girl.
are they sick or wonderful.plz elaborate and answer me
Anytime he says Come here  , there you go right behind him.
tell him to leave her alone.he should be looking for another one.
She was kind of this outcast punk rocker chich with big blue eyes.
as soon as they get mad beacause you wont have sex with them, dump them.
its not bad, but it does look kind of funny if the girl is significantly taller
if its against your religion, then sry, i dont know wut to tell you.
yeah your mom is going out with him
Ya the dark hair, dark eyes, and skin...they are rumored to have nice butts too!
wow.... what a situation..... good luck with that!
Stop asking questions like 'How do I get girls to like me !!!!!!
I personally dont really focus on a guys butt.
he REALLY haz a BIG CRUSH on you!
i got a labrador n luv him a lot!).
but its really hard to avoid!
nope but if your in love sex is a totaly differant experiance.
the best town is ur imagination because if thats all you want you will never get anything
I think she just wants to come to America like everyone else...but thats just me...peaceout !
oooh....thats a tough one....just go out with her friend then shell want you
So how do i approch a woman and ask her to come home with me and my  b/f?
umm..prolly because you're single and couldn't get a date??
u should ask a person u trust or a doctor.
So should I tell my man that I don't like being around him?
first get drenched in the rain and tell ur man to carry u and get cozy
maybe shes playinhg hard to get or she really likes u n dousnt admit it.
Just ask him if he would mind if you sent such pics.
2. my 1st time (& last) time having sex while watching telivision.
And stop letting your hubby be such a slacker!
talk to me-- you can't be that lonely !!

Or  If I see you with another girl, I'll rip her bloody arms off.
if u like sports play vball or bball or whatever!
if you cant to the time [haveing a baby] then dont do the crime [haveing sex]
i mean insider pain, man are not strong they are tough.
but even if, she's still ur friend.
its simple that u should take her out for dating .
Some guys that have experience don't know which way is up.
just ask her if she ever have sex with anyone.
oh, also tell your man why u hated him.
Instinctly, I'm going to say yes.
if not no if your to young like 12 and younger then no.
i like this one guy *jon & he used to like me too.
One might b good n bed, the other a listener!
Men are beautiful no matter what.
and YES ive got lots of chanceS!
SOUNDS LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND ANOTHER WAY TO PLEASE HIMSELF
You can't really expect to give him anything too pricey!
a girl that has a sluty mind set but isnt one u know
Don't spend a lot of money.
As a guy, I know that many...no....the majority of guys are in relationships for there own personal gain..
Why don't you let the crapola pile up?
It really depends how ugly she is.
i think not, unless your trying to commit suicide?
Unless you absolutley love it I would say NO!
and when she does, all she dreams about is him.
SOAP If you smell better maybe.....
Well, that's how I see it anyway....
Or you can say Hey wanna sexy want to go for a soda, just kidding.
Another girl likes the guy that I do, and I feel like I don't stand a chance.
Hmmm, a little vague on the informastion giving.
and me im also mexican but not mixed.
believe that you will find your true love someday... just have faith...
of course cause i wouldn't be able to live with her death
she already knows it not love.
Who cares wha their gender is.
Not special, not weird...  just your personal choice.
it's time to move on...maybe it hurts but that's life.
Rather say, Whos on yer mind...
Party it up while your young.
you really come off as quite creepy...oh ya, STOP TEXTING HER!!
yeah... if i was trying to get out of the relationship
?I promise I won't bring my friends along!...
i'd only get upset if the guy staring is ugly!
If you are not growing and having fun, then the relationship is DEAD.
!are you some kind of schizoprinia?
because we make them nervous and their brains jus go out the window!
Cause we only get blown 4 times a week!
Heck no, I'm a guy, and I wouldn't care if she masturbated infront of me, I would enjoy it.
Believe wat u want 2 blive.
Why waste your time on someone that would disrespect you in that way?
most boys try to be ignorant with girls they like.
Ask him straight up, if he wants to marry you.
it would look funny, but as long as u 2 luv each other.
it will pay off in the long run.
What the hell does that mean?
or just my guy ego cant handle a girl knowin about it !
HE USED TO MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY ABUSE ME.
if he does that means he really cares for you.
Babe, HE IS THE ONE WHO DOESN'T LOVE YOU!!
any chance they'd like each other as well?
Most guys aren't really stupid, you're just meeting the wrong people.
this wedding is not about you, period.
we have phone sex everyday, never get tired of it.
Do something that most people haven't.
Perhaps she doesn't brag about him to her friends the way she used to.
Have your fun now when you are single.
you shouldnt get with your cousin.
Sometimes you have to show guys what you like!
yeah it depends on how long you've been chatting.
here is not the place to find one
Boys want to become men and men want women.
trust ur humor, beauty, intelligence, relation with other, how u conenct... and the like.
I wouldnt want or need anyone else.
Theres this hella hot guy in my neighberhood.
either he loves you or he doesn't...
if you get the real answer here my email teshtad@yahoo.com
is not bad, if you like him.
And you might have already scared her.
not  only men have them, women can too
marry her and go to the court.
See what gets you more heated up.
find me for alot of fun!
You have become just another 'Booty Call'!!!
look out your window because there i am
first kiss send my head spining for a few second.
Some men do and some men don't....
i think 'no answer' is your answer, you just don't want to admit it.
Women want it slow......and take too long for it......men want it without a tease.
Give him a bl*w job once in a while.
maybe he's just checkin' if you're alright.
If you ask him I dont think he would lie to you.
Give me your input because I HATE VALENTINE'S DAY.
GET RID OF CAT,STEAM CLEAN CARPET,FURNITURE,BED LINEN, SPRAY FOR TICKS&FLEAS
If he did, he wouldn't have even looked at the other girl.
dump him hes oviously not interested
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STAND.
what can we do...put a ad in the local paper...
Asking this cuz is like it is always guys that is ready and up for sex..
and also the penis story as well.lol
i'm sorry dude, but that's disgusting.
hey broo if you're not live in Miami area you better get your ass here this is the best........
If you like her ask her out and see where it takes you
I don't, but Homer Simpson is HOT!
Tell him that you are a beautiful vampire ;))
astrology is a bunch of bunk.
when you find your gem hopefully he'll want you for you
I went to one where they had a belly dancer instead...LAME!
no one can control their dream.
maybe that is why it is called fantazys
Or, you could always ask him.
he not into toys or anything freaky.
Do crazy stuff like cover yourselves in whipped cream or something tasty.
GOOD LUCK!...I bet you get him!
Don't let her play games with you.
and tell them how sad you are.
some can't live without it and others can.
friend, spouse, or even your family members.
But YES it could work if you want it to!
I'm 25....are you serious about your age????????
is it just too weird and geeky!
she a player all she wants is a boy toy
also for older kid, try putt putt golf, laser tag, go-karts, that kind of thing.
if that doesn't work tell him that you have an STD.
Just let her know that it bothers you if she does not stop RUN!!!
know a lot of girls here in the philippines that met someone online and got married.
Why dont you ask him out?
If being apart makes them happy then you should be happy for them
when he knows im not looking he will stare at a woman and check them out.
And he broke up with me.
You have a long history with him and you know the real him.
you are living in a fantasy
So that next day I went with my boyfriend out to eat to the place we were going to.
He doesn't like your kids, you don't like his?
If it's a chess cake, much better !!
show her she's important and not your stupid friends
If you can (and its about love), its probably good.
!And there are alot of other guys on this planet.
all of us can see it...why cant she?
we have flurted may times but i just don't know *_*
just them down and explain to them they should be understanding , and support u no matter what .
Then of course there are many questions on wheather i've been f---ked up the a--.
start cutting him off now -- that way when you get married, he'll be used to it
And with protection u can start anytime.
how else could you be but straight forward?
i'd work with him some more.
I married my high school sweetheart's sister.
Knocked up girls lose intrest that way.
got a good cast iron skillet?
U need to ask him DIRECTLY, if he wants to spend the rest of his life with u.
I have gotten dates, not as many as if I played stupid.
he says he respects tht i wanna wait and undetrsatnds!!
What in the HELL should I say??
Don't be a wimpy, winey, wuss.
that's how life works... there will always be ups and downs in your life... just accept it.
if he is joking about liking you, then forget him!
AS THEY SAY....THERE'S SOMEONE FOR EVERYONE!!!
He didn't love you, know how I know?
try watching an adult movie together.
what is a gurl to do?
Get out!-(and then)-Get on with your lives!
believe me, you DO NOT mess with a friend's younger sister.
if he realy loves you than he wouldnt care if you have nothing to offer.
threaten him by saing ur going to call the police if he doesnt pay child support!
i agree with rockhead  don't tell anyone
is that a question for a guy?
just talk to her and see if she does like you.
if you are attracted to men still then you may be bi.
she never got over you the first time...
so how can I tell him?
HOW CAN I HANDLE THIS SITUATION????
depend on the girl if she likes your buutt she will take care of it
i'm just trying to avoid any quarrels... she gets jealous pretty easily!
you feel the best feeling uve ever felt in your whole life
i just wanna help her open up her eyes before something bad happens....
U can tell by the way they look at u and the way the person talks 2 u
I start quiet and get louder and louder and then....BAAAAMMMM!!
i've learned all kinds of things on here that i didn't know before.
jus tell her how you feel and why you love her
the one i had with your mom.
okay youre confusing 1 question at a time.
im sure thats what a guy would want.
Then see what she says, and you'll have your answer
I invested in a food business there... Its pretty good also...
i'm just looking to spice things up in my room...what should i try?
Every once in a while, I won't, just for a change.
to get over him just play with guys
so it's either get over him, or wait.
think about it in my opion dump this fellow?
Sorry if I'm no help but we can talk about it if you want.
If you are a boy then sure!
i never thought i would get asked out but i did.
if you are even asking this question, i think you are probably too young to be getting married.
Not all married men cheat, I didn't when I was married, My wife was my life.
But you'll never catch a woman admitting to it!
who knows , and let the people alone
lol   you juos laugh out loud and you should feel better
comunication but are you sure u wanna do that
tell ur partnner and undetstand him well, help ur self to help each other.
maybe one day they will be conviced.
talk this one out girl before you make a bigger mistake...
There no better way than tell him frankly, but tendly, sweetly ...
Invite him for a dinner or movie!
mr nobody get drunk and kiss her that is how i did it three year ago.
Say a prayer to help u guide the best possibilities.. people come and go in ur life.
Have you two been hanging out with your parents?
no only if they are sick
Probably not, but again, I don't think I would want him to.
And ask yourself if he is a decent person and is nice.
be friend and give him some timen space
and let your personality shine through and dont be fake, girls can sense that.
it's easy to say yes, but i have a feeling it would be tough to do.
DONT TAKE ACTION, CUZ SHE'LLGET HERS EVENTUALLY.
I am scared to ask him if he stills likes me, because I liked him too.
i guess people want what they can't have.
Please, send me some more info if you need help ;-)
Besides... do we really want our moms to be liars?
i dont think that girls are bad liars.
Did you ask him what lead him to cheat?
it is better and easier to tell over the phone or in person.
with kids its not so simple.
because distance makes lies harder to hide.
lights off w/ very few candles and on top of the covers
Then, he broke up with me after a few days!!!
love is caring for someone, or something that you would not forget.
you are still a kid wait
That means you can have your cake and eat it too!!!!
if he says no he's cheating.
dude, go back to lickin yer nuts.
nope are u a guy or girl?
At least i would.Oh and its cost free!
If you only want your ex then leave the rest alone.
my husband and i moved in after 2 weeks go 4 it
its the same reason mine is.
Some men just need a little extra stimulation to ... ahem, get the job done.
If you like him then of course you should continue, why wouldn't you?
What goes on in mens head???
Yeah right he knows he dont know me!
Even if he never admits it, dont allow it if you dont want it.
Weeelllllllll......men think with their penis' and it gets bored.
it's d inside that makes us girls happy.
when youlike a guy who like you back
I know this is a lot to remember, but trust me!
remember that this guy needs to help pay for your expenses, too.
get him drunk and take off your clothes!
MAKE LOVE WITH A LOVED ONE .
Would I date a stripper, probably not.
i dont like big tits! )
then jon asked me if id be jealous if he went out with this one girl *alyssa.
Wat are you good at doing?
becaue my train of thought ran off the track and bumped all other men's off to
Make them laugh and they'll love u.
One said, I can't leave my kids, the other said, why do you want to have coffee with me!
abbout 3 to 4 hunred is my gguess
hey Be yourself if she dont like you then move on you are still young
He is a guy what do you expect

Hubby & i got married in July (7-7-01) and went to Hawaii for 2 weeks!
How do i get out of it?
i dont know... are you in love?
maybe you should not be worried at all.
if u are in luv u will never feel boared....thats TRUE LUV my frind.
Why don't you get a job, and then you'll have money of your own.
Well, if he makes you happy and you make him happy, then go for what you know!!!
i just want some good love songs to listen to i know it's kind of sappy but whatever
just tell him without having sex with him and you won't come over being cheap!
what if you're interested in a lady, but not sure if she is in you?
Because once they are interested then the CHASE is over
doesnt mean he doesnt care about you.
and he can not notice that.........!!!!!!!!
because most of them are horny assholes that can't get any.
well how old are u and i would like to be ur friend
Its all up to you.Just dont look too hard.
don't ask let him say it on his own
that is just too much skin for me!!!!!!!
ya the moneys is great but there alot of stuff in those places .
You mite lose the one you love,to some- one else.
SO YOU CAN LEAN FROM IT
Do i walk away or stay around????
FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT AGE MATCH THE DESIRES DIFFER...SO BE CAREFUL
I laughed my ass off when i read it.
other than that, go to a party and hit on drunk chicks.
CAUSE THEY THINK THERYRE POPULAR AND HOTT AND THEY JUST ARE WHEN IT COMES TO DATING
yes tell him the worst he will do is say no
)I want respect and I want him to be nice.
Or whatever, he's a dumb guy anyway!
so wht to ddo YOU think!
my friend likes this guy and he said he would like to get to know her better.
good question i'm a girl so us girls  will never know!
Since women feel they are mature for their age, why not?
but do you love somebody ?
Stopped a kid from J walking / running accrost the street in the rain.
Do Not Give into Him Easy it gives him to much control to fast.
It's odd that someone so young is on here answering questions...
YOu can have Full intercourse... if you want....
Don't let a man walk all over you.
did you catch him or did he volunteer the info.
Do you really want to marry a guy in a trial for 2 attempted murders???
u've gotta accept the sad truth.
if she's shy than probably she reaallyyy likes you.
to th extent of giving my soul away...but if its oneside love i wont do anythng!!!
Have them take a Lie Detector Test - a good one.
Yeah I F****N hate this day too!!
even on silent he can see the missed calls.
wow thats really sad...were do you live???
do it in person though, set up a dinner date.
Really though, they are just bad news.
phone sex is like an alternative from doing the real thing.
once u've talked to her then decide where u are going to live.
personally i dont think that that is useful.
she likes to dye her hair different colors
And your time and YOUR life!
your guess is as good as mine.
Ha ha, have a delightful day.
do it for your country man!
if it doesnt fit in the mouth
well it depends..   how old r u & how old is ur mom???
So how do I tell them?
some people are very ignorant thats all just be there for them
does he care about things relates to your not?
that has 2 be the worst thing to do to your friend roght now!
good looks,good habbits & ofcourse a great figure makes a girl a good girlfrind
either way it's going to be painful.
is because nobody has done it to then so they dont know how it feels.
Hey, what are you saying, seems you know nothing about women.
do you have a pic page or something.
Start by saying I want to kiss you here (nose) then here (mouth) and here (cheek) Then here (neck)!
if you are not married and have sex, its bloooody and hurrrty.
I wouldn't worry about the heroin.
I'm sorry if you love him (wait you said that you didn't) Anywho, leave him please!
wellllll some guy's butts are cute.
Beautiful girls can be found everywhere, just look around you!!
yeah, me v6 and jj all go to his school.
people have lots of reasons why  they have not found that right person.
He needs to grow up and mature
Let her try on a sports bra.
I have been nothing but nice to her everyday....what should i do?
u broke up leave it 2 him
that's the best way to find out.
As Gab said...no way to know.
p.s.- the muslim question is funny.
if you watched spider-man the upsidedown kiss catch him off gaurd and just lay it on him
You shouldnt think that because then everyone will think u are stupid( like me.)
do they really love you or do they just say it.
They are just dreams you know.
Turn ons: Hairy chest and chin.
HE'S IGNORING U FOR THE SAME REASONS WE IGNORE YOU!
No contact whatsoever just a simple crush or do i have to get over it.
once by mistake i had proposed her and she had accepted.
What if the people were guys?
and i say this because its true.....Its not the only thing.
different men like different things...i know guys that like big girls (I also know some that don't).
Just tell her that you need a hug every once in a while.
Don't just hand it to her.
Maybe the both of you need time apart.
its coo when ur in like 6th grade???
you tend to love the person more when you have sex
boys just want sincere and caring females who can accomodate them in life and nothing else
him nd i met through a friend(his bro.)
i advise u dont hold anything bak.
Takes a lot of patience, I bet.
Not necessary but it helps a lot!!!
& i told him yes very.
He's already got a girlfriend it sounds like.
No matter if your in a skirt and heals or a baggy pair of jeans.
he obviously is trying to hit another girl so i would back off.
just tell him to his face in a nice way, that its over.
I'd never pack my husband's bag!
move on and STALK someone else.
Don't be dumb like I have been.
ya know I have the same problem, so I know what ya mean.
when my girlfriend bit my cock off and ate it
I wouldn't want my guy having lunch with some other lady on V-day!
obesty is the .2. killer in young people now.
you do not find her it will just happen.
if only i knew the answer...
go to a very important (in her life) vacation resort
and she dont want other people to say anything.
IM me now on yahoo messenger using my ID :pao_sky2000
well just like me 2 years ago.
So, he says you don't truly love him because you only called him twice??
i think its alot  important .
please her in the bed room also.
I know a lot of decent guys.
just keep trying to find that special some one.
EVEN THOUGH IT'S OKAY, YOUR PARTNER NEED NOT KNOW EVERYTHING YOU THINK ABOUT.
that's more exciting u know.shyness sucks.
yea i used to do it all the time
Just put it out there casually.
Wait, even now all thier stuff is bullshit.
sex plus friend does not always equal love to both men and women.
find a girl that share the same intrest you do
If you truly like this person, then why not give it a try?
just curious if any gurls have any advise about havin sex for the first time...
no only if you want your friend to watch too
Being 8 years old is pure HELL isn't it??
You guys need a marriage counsellor or a bigger bed.
Sex is Like Air & Water.
O and trust me IT CAN GET BAD!!!
it was about 10years ago but they still really love each other.
and their friends will bad talk you to theirs and so on and so on
on state and federal grants (you don't have to pay grants back).
if youre talkin about here, the internet, that is a wrong place.
And you don’t need special shoes !
If he won't sit with you, then you know it's just friendship.
If he is unwilling to lick it then don't let him stick it.
First, Who broke up with who?
adam and eve.... they were smart tho
Wow, what an ego you have.
Know anyone who can make a cake...there you go!
um o let me think NOOOO.Get real this isnt a chat room
Why can´t you just do it?
If he loves her why not?
tell him ur boss or just dump him and get anouther man in ur life
And then if you havent already, get you to a doctor!
Very truly speaking, wether my friends agree or not, they cannot ever find a friend like me.
Just say 'I love you' getting him/her off guard.
HE ALWAYS SAYS SORRY..BUT THEN A MONTH LATER HES LYING AND BEING DISHONEST.
My boyfriend farts and belches like a government mule!
and if he likes you for your activities, start doing things that he wouldn't like.
you will always wonder if you never tell him the truth
It's Fate that does that :)
Love them because God loved you first.........
you should think it through very good.
I fell to my knees, I won't ever forget that weird moment.
listen to the song baby baby stay gone by jimmy wayne.
But i enjoy necking and even a little caressing.
First off, don't do anything you don't want to.
Q3) B - I married a handsome mean guy and I divorced him.
if you both can wait, then it's worth it.
LEAVE HIM ALONE OR YOU MIGHT BE RUNNING INTO TROUBLE.
love is not scary-if it scary =IT NOT LOVE You just haven't met the MrRight yet so GOOD LUCK
YOUR RIGHTS ARE TO DATE AND GO ON!
Your mom kicked the wrong person out.
Okay, if you want it to be special, DON'T buy her etible panties!
ITS not even for you ..
Don't push the ladies... they don't respond well.
well, yes, but I hope I never have to.
and we sat on my bed and looked in her eyes and huged her and kissed/made out with her
just wait... maybe its yet the time for you to meet the right one
either you get along with this person or you do not.
I'm not a prude at all, i love oral sex, porn, i'm good looking.
The waves in boracay normally dont get that big eventhough its raining...
you no longer want to see his/her face.
no not really but if you do f=get preganat your baby can be stillborn or have birthdefects
if your not hiding things, showing her should cause fewer fights than not showing her.
don't go back out with her.
IF GURLS DONT LIKE U FOR THAT they HAVE PROBLEMS
wat do i do with both of them?
Did his boss give him a hard time...?
best way is LOOK STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES and u will get the answer
Men like younger women and I am not going for a woman my age.
if killing himself is what it's going to take for him to get over this then so be it.
THEN.....HE TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF AND MY STUPID BUTT WENT TO SEE HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.
p.s...not criticizing or labelling you at all!
Don't blow it on a thing called sex.
But men are people to and have feelings just like us ladies do.
Women are different, just like men are.
Well it cna mean many differnt things.
Yes dude, if you start lifting your a** off that chair!
Just remember a man is stll a man.
Many men are, but all men are not.
yes, at least mine do live.
If she is getting jealous then their must be a reason why.
strike 1, he no like kids.
she did it once, shame on her.
If you like guys and girls, then you are bi.
I think a guy with a nice round butt is sexy.
If you're not planning to marry him, why bother?
depends on choice, but i like dog style too much..ok
well... if you like her guess it is ok.
start showin him more lovin attention!
I didn't believe till I saw her eyes.
i was 15 that was 9 months ago an im still with her.
you should have sex when you're horny.
Unless the chick didn't care if I slept with other hoes.
First of all, the guy didn't do it TO you.
Not accusingly, but just a nice conversation?
my man loves me and i hope ur man loves u
come to romania with me, i already live there:)!
If you want to get married then do so.
She is the boss, and you had an intimate interlude with her -that is that.
i think he got didtent because he feels bad.
“I know he’s a jerk but he says he wants to be with me.”
If you are really her friend you won't even consider it!!
congratulation to him and his bride, she is lucky :-)
But you're probably too good for her anyway.
send a video of yourself having sex, it pays
It wouldn't matter how she looks.
I'm not sure even chickens care about it thats what
she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work.
if she is aromantic, get her some flowers and chocolate eventhough valentines day is over.
Would u like to be called stupid?
I want to try and spice things up.
because if you're not, it will be dry sex and will hurt.
no, he just likes to talk to you
but if you think that this could lead you to a heartbreak then wait and watch what happens!!
It cant be love because you dont know anything about her!
Ok been there done that sweetie.
Why in the world would you do something like that and then go around telling it???
I HOPE ALL WORKS WHETHER IT IS FINDING YOUR LOVED ONE OR FINDING A NEW LOVED ONE.
but they dont have to be half naked.
and if you are not ready to becoming a mom, start prtecting yourself from getting pregnant...
sorry about that... don't fall for it again... save yourself the hurt
Pick yourself up, don't let it bother you too much, and just have fun/play the field.
I think females do it too.
If she's really, really ugly, then yes - not having sex is very beneficial.
you will find the one that is for you.
with love will be full of sweet meanings
Just like she did to you.
tell her that you love her and try to find money,,,,,,
Maybe you should tell her and see what response you get.
My yahoo chat name used to be 'iscreamifyoudoitright'
when your boyfriend dose not im u or call u for 3 weeks what would u do
this is how my wife keeps my ATTENTION!!
because they are not happy missing somthing from their relationship
To my Bestsest friend (x infinity 2) your friend forever I LIKE CEREAL ^-^

Its easy Find someone to marry you in the Jail
Didnt know until know but hey herre's one for ya!

your still going to feel you can not trust men.
but woman do talk about it alot!
Hey, Honey...do you wanna talk about what's going on?
When you cant get that person off your mind
Then don't go back for him.
just look at her eyes and smile.
it means exactly what she says.
i am a gemini actually but honestly spiking i dnt bliv in horoscopes.
For some guys does it not always matter just about the sex?
yea my ex said the same thing once.
if all he wanted was to make-out with u, he didnt really love u!
you didnt say if your wife had children .
It is called, He's just not that into you.
You can do better, doll !
yeah but you get more horny than fall in love
He is a piece of shit and i never want to see him agen.
far enough to be away from family but close enough so they can visit maybe once a month?
when you can hear echother without speaking
yeah baby.. a girl knows what a irl wants right???
you know your in love if u have sex with them
Why not get a job and send him money?
I can't help thinking, was it me?
what happens if the relationship does'nt work out?
Act yourself; just keep your tongue in your mouth and knees together!
But according to me its unfair!
yes you can fall in love after 4 mönths , it could be .
I got 2: u judge for yrself.
Do you have a chicken butt?
Because men are so good at it we could not be compared !!
personality above all...   then fit body (and not neccessarily thin) and kindness...
you can like who ever u like
admit it she doesnt wanna go out with u
Jesus - why not POKE every man's EYES OUT?
Come on yaar its ok now.
yes get rid of the cat.
sounds like you are hot, so thats a good start!
First, choose only one guy, you love.
Why in the world WOULDN'T a guy date a virgin?
I say think long and hard about it.
You'll never get any peace if you keep him around
(no offense to big butts, but it was a MAN).
u surely did the right thing!
i sure would like to talk to someone
like me my luv lives far away from me.
I think playing hard-to-get is your best bet!
I kinda like my guys thick.
Send your ex a nice Valentines day gift.
and when your hot like you are its worth it
Because you're the only ten I see!
Sex with my hunk ( I didn't have to share him)
tell him you don't want to marrie him and if he keeps it up run
YOUR DAUGHTER COMES FIRST IN ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE NO MATTER WHAT!
theres a mr right for every girl.
i made it and so can you.
yeah like lumbeeman said, have your bff tell him for you
do any other girls feel the same..?
if it's love, then he will wait and also not cheat on you
Be young - have fun... Don't take life so seriously.
A hard face 2 go wit it.
Yes get out of there quick
as long as u r true.true love u will find anywhere.
I think about sex non-stop, and even more than all of my guy friends.
(sung as off key as possible)  silly songs are the way to go!
hold your head up and smile.
at the maximum 3to5 years older than you.
Just come in front of her and tell her that you are the man of her dreams!
SO theres a lot more out there then what is happening right now.
even if they laugh at the time.
It did in my head LOL.
We fall for girls of all shapes and sizes.....EVERY guy is Defferent
sure as long as you like him.
you're a fucking retard and if you were my kid you wouldn't be allowed to date.
i wanna help but i'm too lazy to read it
The rest is just window dressing.
find someone better, someone you deserve.
I've been hanging out with this really hott guy and we are getting closer and closer every day.
i love my ex with all my heart.
and stay away from the plants i mentioned.
If she likes you - great.
if its because you like someone else- say that.
Have you ever heard of descriminating based on sexual orientation...and how that is WRONG???
well it creeps ME out but some people get intense pleasure from it...go figure
any person hu loves u shud think think about your feelings.
Until then, quit being such a jerk.
she says that it doesnt mean anything and that is every guy's dream.
And you should be very respectable about it to.
are you sending him the wrong message?
you have to want to let go and move on or you won't be able to.
i can tell u that all girl think different.
what happend to his queen kong?
But that also depends on WHO YOU are??
But I guess you could always try it, is it worth it to you??
i don't know are u ready for one?
wanna have girl frnds or boy frnds?????
it isnt a sin = ) and you can go as far as YOU want.
if she asks me and I don't know the answer.
Why don't you have a job?
but i really really like him
I told him how do you know I'm looking at you ????
Would it bother him if you did were asking guys for pictures?
couldn't have been bad if they married anyway.
I'm telling you, it was LONG.
Plus, women aren't just ready You need to help...
but if you have to ask you are probably too young or immature to really get married.
My mom's boyfriend and I always argue.
I'm a self-proclaimed nympho, but I dunno if I'm just really nasty or really horny... all the time.
The position they like the best is walking upright in the shopping mall with your money!!
actualy like few hours ago i kinda got offered to spend the night at a girls place i know..!
jus t tell them u already have a date sorry about that you should have asked earlier
Stop thinking about what could be and dreaming.
my guess is you dont look the same to her either if you dont inspire her to inpress you.
Looking back, I am not really sure why I did it!
I'm not asking him to go out or anything even close to that!
To risky if you ask me(which you just did).
But if u really want to know just ask her.
who needs gud looks if he acts like a beast???
Ask him if he'd like to go somewhere with you.
we get along great except this issue.
where do u get these stats?
if you don't like any of the guys that asked you out then just say no.
it's kind of weird for him probably.
Im smart but I dont think Im smart enough for him.
Hasn't there ever been a girl who you liked alot but not liked enough to be with?
Because if you go down that road and bail on him later, that would truly suck!
yes, like you are a complete stranger to me.
Run like hell and never look back.
Some say if they ask god for forgivness for being gay they will enter heaven...
i care for him a lot, but only as a friend.
LEARN HOW TO SPELL CANT UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION
don't do something you would regret later.
he probably won't tell you, but he's most likely to tell sum1 else.
Then i started smoking and drnking.
if u agree with him no prob but wot do u feel?
as thick as you want it.
and she just has this constant fear.
There are some great looking young 50 year old men; but why not look for younger men!!
WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF ABOVE ME?
It's not just a guy thing.
Sweety, why can't you just ask her out?
She is nothing special to others, but she is my true LOVE... That's all !!
Ever heard of a pajama party????
or do you enjoy hurting those that mean so much to you.
My friend always teases for who I am!
heck no move one, been there done that sheet.
So I will tell you what alot of the guys I know dream of.
its not good to date them all
The same problem is with me
but once she leaves him karma goes around so it will go back to him.
don't let him see you down.
But, we are happy and enjoy life!
go out with him once and if u liked that date then duh stay with him
why their more exciting sports are the ones with a lot of contact?
No, seriously..  DON'T get him another dog!
sex with love of course... you have to love that person you are making love with... it`s really important...
its better to loose a lover than love a looser
if you asking this it means that you love your wife.
Hun if ya want to be Girlfriend Materal Be yourself.
no, because my breast to big
(read my Q&A)...I was dating my new girls friend, n i dumped her.
I'm just his friend, I mean, I LOVE him and as far as i know, he has no idea.
SEX IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS A MAN CAN DO IN LIFE AND IT FEELS GREATTTT
well that too in the same house where he is living right now...under angelina's nose!........cool huh?
if a black man breaks into my house is it fair to say most black people are criminals!
Was I not attractive to him that night?
where a sexy outfit get yourself all pretty make him his fave dinner and then give him sex.
A woman wants an honest guy.
first and formost, for him just to say so shows the kind of man he really is.
if he did call it was atleast once a week.
women liking women is very common and some grow to like it more others let if fade over time.
I am cause if i wasnt then i'd be w. a girl lol!!
girls esp--- have u ever gone out with a guy u liked but dint really know?
Oh yes, if you realy feel the need to..send him one too.
makes 4 quick access i guess?
but women doesnt care it so much like mens do anyway.
or just excited about being in love?
Hand the mofo a toilet brush.
Theres no need to keep playin games.
first of all, that's not typical of a guy.
i would probably break up with him.
I for one dislike fake boobs.
What a tangled web you've woven...
whats so hard to understand?...the guy just wanted to get into your pants
Don't give him too many chances.
-im just wondering-      -thanks for answering-
if you guys dont have sex, then i dont see a problem.
get buck wild have sex anywhere and everywhere.
i believe that they will.why not?
or you really love that person, me?
Arent u answering ur own Q
We're not talking about flirting as in playing dumb.
ENJOY LIFE CAUSE U LIVE ONLY ONCE.
I say, Look what you wearing.
and he thought I enjoyed myself.
i think that boys are more sensitive but girls show it more.
please leave her go on with your life.
love will find a way, if you guys really are meant to be...
i dont think u should give him any more times u dont wanna get hurt again
you can but do u really mean it??!
woman wants some challenge, not just a guy she can walk all over him.
well, just try to observe his action.
personally can't even think of going out with someone i gave the boot to bf.
Holy Grail my friend, Wish I knew.
Satisfy UR self but be careful USE PROTECTION!!
Just remember its up to you if u dont want to u dont have to!
it is not a bad thing.
Have a good life, don't let him way you down.
as little as possible forgive and forget
If a guy didn't really care, he wouldn't give a damn.
all guys do it even when they're married
but lately he avoids me & wont even talk to me.
Divorce is not something that kids like.
Do a good deed every day!
start looking for someone  more compatable and closer your age
No guy wants to be just friends with women.
lol do ya get it now?
from my on experince it depend's on the both of you.
maybe cause u sound so sorry
it's not all about how long, it's about how long and how thick!
I'm in my mid twenties and am still a virgin.
if it doesnt mean anything then y is she goin out w/ another gurl ?
give him a chance and some time to get to know your children.
if they love each other they will live together
oh yes you can.....Where were you that day in sex ed?
Believe me, sweetheart, people are not always who they first appear to be.
when you want to give him a bear hug everytime you see him
1.when you hear that love song and all you think about is them.
Is it coz he doesnt trust me?
u don't need to worry about that.
it kinda depends though when you are older
He'll find that with another, but YOU want something more, don't you?
try wallstreet :))..i mean stocks and all...
It seem's from your statement, your just hangin on to a dream... Dr Checko... (Nickname)
SO SPILL THE BEANS AND LET IT FALL WHERE IT LANDS.
however I think stupid far excedes dumb.
y does the skin color matter??
You should definately tell her to wait.
then if he still wants to be friends only.
If you get tied up in mess your going to come out with mess.
make him think u have intrest in his best-friend
yes ya not and now that person seem to be a good frined
things like this are bad to do thru email
And if I got my ass dumped for it, I'd deserve it.
Then it is up to her to listen or not and find out in the hard way or not
it is better to 'lets quit'
REally tell her to think twice.
nah..you girls are just too paranoid in everything
And u tell him it's ur way or no way.
when me & matt first got together i really liked jon, & i didnt know he liked me too.
same reason why men do it!~ ^_^
Dress like a decent lady and you will find nicer guys.
cos one way or another shes GONNA find out if we got to bed together!
that's a stupid question to ask, if you don't know you never will.
Yea u love him but u wanna risk him gettin sumthin an bringin it back ta u?
need alot of answers so shoot
If the guy treats you great, who cares what his butt is like.
they dont want to be your friend anymore?
they are a big part of your life too...
Some men are scared of marige, and stuff so a good talk might help!
Just remember alot of married men are very happy.
Just assure her that mom/dad both love her very much even tho mom/dad don't live together anymore.
tell her you been there and he gave you crabs
Say hi, then just have casual conversation with him.
i asked him if he still liked me & he said no.
youare no old in fact you need to do things that you like doing ?
no,becuase he doesn't really know her if he met her on the internet.
no it s not noemal it is abnormal
dont force it because you might make a mistake.
If the guy doesn't like her, then advice to move on.
nobody will give you a positive responce
somebody is there for ur good and for ur bad moments.
see if she emails you back or find out in person.
flowers,  not roses that might be too strong.
You two should be boinking like rabbits.
But if you hve to ask then you already know.
good things come to those who wait.
if your girl loves you to bits, then your past shouldn't stand in your way.
Notiing wrong with this, does he join in also, i'd say if it's 3 together thats cool, otherewise no
And its usually the one who is not as good in bed as the other.
dont try to impress her at all.Just let her know that you like her
I lost my virginity at the age of 17, I honestly didn't know what the hype was all about.
do you chat in yahoo chat rooms?
you dont like him, you like his friend,why not tell him?
I don't like seeing her ribs though, sorry supermodels.
why do married /committed men cheat?
What exactly do guys want from girls?
Is sex soooooo good that people are willing to risk so much??
is sad how some people are..
But beware, if you wait too long, when you're ready most of girls will think it's wierd.
Is it that you don't have one, or your ehaving trouble with the one you have?
Be blunt... Hey, you guys going to let me in on the conversation or what?
gather all ur girlfrends & have a party.. let her mingle w/new faces..
if you are 25 and he's 34, then thats not so bad.
If u wana attract ur husband's attention and #@$#)*)#)_*, then u gotta remember TWO WORDS; FOOD AND SEX.
you could find the most beatiful natural blonde and tall girl in this world but she wouldn't be smart!!
ask a question ya might get an anwser intead of just points
if u were to fall in love with a girl, would it be her: personality?
Because trust me: later in life you will regret it!
Just talk to him, stop wasting time!!
Please try to remember this: The leading cause of DIVORCE is GETTING MARRIED!!
and u kno wat  he doin but u don't care cuz u let him tell ya different.
you dont even know how old he is???
yes u could fall in love after 4 months trust me it happen to me
Just say  I love me too.
there is a girl in my school who i sort of have a crush on.
Do you dream about her at night?
If that doesn't work, talk to a friend (not about him)!
I dont even talk to other guys.
LMAO, great way to start the day, LOL
a picnic lunch in a beatiful, quiet, private setting.
where is he working.. how many hours... ask him.
u know we do it too!
wow...well ive been in the situation.
Ask her permission if in doubt!!
).....I am looking for virgin girl as I havent sex yet.
Don't say to much stuff.Say hi!!
Then a personality that isn't too bad.
DONT WORRY YOU SHOULD GROW UP AND OUT OF THAT
because they are an orgasm addict
I don't want her to die.
no but u can be so one's bi***
If you like him say yes if you dont say no
The world is full of fucking guys ...
Odds are you wouldn't get married anyway so find someone new!
you need to sign another one every day with each other.
i think everybody has a right to enjoy my girlfriend doin stripping..  U r welcome to the party too.
but dont let it bother you.
Unless it was a good dream, of course.
when the ache from the love consumes perhpas...
Of course.I would go.I do not have to be a muslim to attend such a wedding!
Save your heartbreak, find a nice guy.
you don't need all girls to like you--just one.
Probably the flirting led you to beleive he DID want more?
Ask for her phone number... if she does not give it - then SHE DOES NOT LIKE YOU.
for me a girl beein mature!
Dump him, just because you love him ...doesn't mean he love you.
That would be NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS !
But I have my own opinions too :P
LOL is short for LAUGHING OUT LOUD.
is it ok for me to have sex with my gf?
you never know, try flirting with girls...that helps
Don't let some other girl get a chance with your crush.
(throws bananna at the screen and scratches head)..lol..Just kidin.
i would hit it even if she was still dripping from his sex
do whats right and listen to your heart!!
Ask her out on a casual date.
u cant get married in jail
then you have to ask hey!
First of all dont call then stupid and ugly because they like u.
gosh...i love my sister to death, but she always seems to put herself in unhealthy relationships.
go to iraq and keep in touch.
STAND ON A CHAIR OR WALK ON STILTS!
no, it just like he loves exchanging girlfriends every now and then.
That you are the one and only..
Most people don’t even get there.
try this, did this person have sex with their spouse before they got married?
what's so shameful sex is freakin' awesome!
Just surprise him...... You can do it!
Your story  is like in TV series.
mayb thier hubbys are not good enough....
ok, i think its just nothing.
if you love someone it's because who the are not because the color of their skin
i did quit and joined a rec team and i had so much more fun.
the problem is that the girls that do smell.. think they don't.
were not getting any younger, that is the adveture in life.
when i catch him staring at a woman he denies it and yells at me.
you got that right .but have to do it any way .or she kill me.
whatever you do, just make sure you are not caught up in their fights.
only if u guyz r best friends
I want to be myself but not scare her away, what should i do?
(at least of course if you are over 18!)
go out with ur ld friends to meet other new friends.
anyone who 'doesn't get it' is brainwashed.
not very sexy if you ask me.
All I know is i am with you there!
hmmm.....If u dont know then I wont tell you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
im a boy i know what you should do
Sex and candy Where can I find you?
maybe she also got the same feeling as u are..............
i don't think he doesn't trust you.
sorry but no, get a job
Why get married.... just become some ones Biotch
Well if u are really lookin for advice... Don't do it...
Don't let him use you ...and by that I mean - Think about your self.
actually this sounds weird but try watching both kinds of porn One gay, one straight.
a woman married a dolphin, so why not
be yourself, be confident, and be honest... if it's not meant to be then so be it
It makes me feel good about myself when other guys hit on me and flirt with me.
I don't think so...  Behave yourself...
(I don't want to be mean) but it sounds like he may have some cheating issues.
I dont have my g/f wait on me.
of his life, and he would never cheat on me.
I tell my guy that I love him every day.
Whana come sit in my cock pit!!
Lights on and on top is sexy!
Well, if she dumped you because you were just being you then.
I can't believe he is telling you.
Most of all - HAVE FUN!
Just means that they aren't playing games with their sexuality.
I love sex too and can't get enough of it.
I luv talking to him, it's like I don't feel real good unless I talk to him.
We're all a little screwy round here!
thats kool dude.. i still have a long way to go.. but thanks for this 2 points.=D
You seem like a sweet person...you can find better!
Guys like a little (not alot) mystery in a girl.
I praised my god for got her as my wife.
but thats not a bad thing if you enjoy it and its with a responsible person.
I just had a vision... you'll get married as soon as you decide to do so!
i think u should just write him a note
how old r u well that doesn't even matter run
honey just come right out and tell him about the phone call.
Try some honesty, it works for me
He didn't think about u at all.
I know it sucks now but you'll get over him.
BEEN married 3 time and have two sons!!!
he is getting married to a women right?
ask her politely why u havent' heard from her for years.
you have been hanging around with the wrong women.
like he is really cute then what do you do then
then she will think you are really hiding something.
that is a lie  if you really  love the person  your relationship  will stay strong  no matter what
Or you could spred rumors about her where ever you are.
she does it again, shame on you.
you are doing the right thing just devorce him, and get back to your life.
then go ask her out,, :)
We have 3 children under 5, so it's not like I can play with him for very long.
they are not good to have around babies they have dieases.
Hey doesnt everyone like theirself or @ least what they look like??
but you aren't really asking anything here.....
Here's the answer that Life is great!
Once I just said, Well, if there's nothing better to do .
where the heck do you live?
maybe he just doesn't feel like talking.
Having younger friends will help make up think & feel younger =)
Surprise her with it and give her little gifts during the dinner!
a boyfriend thats his friend to.
tell him your baby is in need of him
you get in life what you pay for.
But, still wants to have sex with you.
yes its ok, everyone is attracted to other people.
MY GRANDMOTHER TELLS THIS STORY BETTER!
But yeah, guys do think about sex more than girls.
(you all know you were thinking it!!)
see how it goes from there
except that didn't end too great... :(
so what do u want to do now?
People dont care anymore about others.
Get over yourself and go to that wedding!
my best friend is a guy and we have never tried to be more
What you need to do is get MAD!!!
ask them wen theyre hooked up 2 a lie detectotr
In my case though, it didn't!
you won't find love on the internet
ask the girl to go to the dance.
you can do alot of things.
lol.. what the heck are you waiting for...  go after him duh!
play with his lil buddy while hes playing
how much does your balls sweat?
if you feel shy, just tell him to close his eyes.
If the boy has such an attitude of mind he's not worth ur love even if u r simple.
u need to talk to him about it and tell him to stop
well, why did you post such a stereotypical, dumb and pointless question?
Your 3 year already has a daddy
19, almost 20...  how old are you?
A girl should like you for who you are and nothing else!
come to henderson north carolina there is enough of them here
If you're already having sex with the guy anyway...  Best thing to do is have sex.
We're not mind readers you know...
some poeple just need a little push.
If that doesn't do it, then I'm stumped.
Dude, I hate to say it but she was cheating on you with this guy before you broke up.
If she like the beach maybe a weekend in the Bahamas.
well if you really love her, this will happen for sure.
Don't even do that to yourself!!!
Don't buy a women clothes unless she picks it out, you do not know what looks good on her.
just be patient dont' rush your self.
take it slow and you try to make it perfect.
Games, games games, don't play them, you always loose.
And don't think you won't be getting pleasure from it.
jon & i used to be really close & talk all the time about anything & everything.
She might come clean to u if she doesn't want to be with u anymore.
tell your parents u love them and move on.
sorry I dont know where to find him...
Dogs r like family(trust me i know.
What can I do to get her to lose weight?
they have lots of great suggestions on there.
Never let anyone tell you different
yes, the butt is an important physical feature on a guy that makes him attractive.
an easy way of saying he just wants to be a booty call.
I couldn't hurt someone I cared about that way.
I don't know, I think it is mixed.
What if some guy would ask, why are all woman s1uts?
YOu don't have to run but you might want to tell him to slow down!
So what should I do for her!!
I know I already said that.
He didn't care if he knew!!!
go on a cruise and push her overboard.
IT WHAT U MAKE OF IT.
its not so good for the person who has the available booty.
mabey but ill never find him
she's playing with you is what my neighbor says is going on.
i ve never been with a guy who doesnt have a great body.
but definately force her because no bra is very unattractive.
You should call him and ask him
I have dated several bi females and its a turn on BIGTIME!!!
dont be so posesive, let him free, guys likes freedom
but i absolutely love italian women!
I'd give you 100pts for that one!!!!
keep your head high and dont give up hope if things dont work out!
if he speaks about it then listen to him and show that u care.
People are just plain dumb .
and i say this in the friendliest way that i can.
Think of the &$%# he would get if he was dating a girl in Jr. High.
your wrong on that one personal issues huh?
my advise: dont go out with a stranger.
chances are only once in a blue moon!!!
You shouldn't second guess what you guys do if both of you are cool with it.
No, this is not bad at all.
but if ur ok w/ it, and it should b ok!
if he is doing it by choice that should be questioned and watched very closely
guys r not scared of the word love.
THAY LEFT US KNOW CHOICE BUT TO PART.i NEVER STOP LOVING HIM.
Go where ur P leads u mayb even in the wrong direction!
Having sex with a guy who was toooooo smallllll!!!
Why did you like doing it?
i went to clubs and that was just for a fun night.
I'VE HEARD OF FRIENDS THAT START GOING OUT AND FIND OUT THEY WERE EANT TO BE.
none of the above,ask me about big boys or small boys,and i will tell you.lol
I love having phone sex w/my bf.
You really need to learn to read a person, you know?
or that he would like to see you wear, and then go back and buy it.
before too long..>>>>> YOU SUCKED THEM INTO YOUR BLACKHOLE OF LOVIN!
hay just be friends with him
(and i hope things turn out right..)
Men dont like women to tell them what they need to do.
But dont feel  bad or hurt if he tries to put you down,Life is long.
In my sweetie's eyes, I am.
because u already know so much about oneanother.
thats funny u asked that cuz i kinda felt like that about a girl once, cant really explain why.
or just pretend he isnt there.
If you're considering taking him back DON'T.
You're a threat alright, you just don't know it yet.
Just speak with your eyes baby!
GREAT KISSER BUT GREAT SEX IS NICE TOO:)
yeah your just confused and don't know who you want right now
it depends on u. but would u want to?
Oh, and if the guy is to marry the girl, she can't have slept with too many other guys.
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER!!
what kind of friend are you looking for?
nope.. maybe he wants 2 hear ur voice b4 he tucks himself 2 bed.
Probably the one thing that comes before good health on the human scale of existance!
You do understand they're just using you, don't you?
just latch on to his di ck and you will instantly own him.
Sex is serious and dirty, Making love is fun.
ha ha that stuff is all true thats how i get sometimes...
because some guys tottally lose their brain when they are around hot grl like me :)
when women get togeather thats one of the main toppics.
Maybe you are into the bad boys???
you most likely can do alot better.
Just where ever you go give her the best of the best!
I know I personally would WANT my daughter to be a lesbian because I know what guys are like.
if they dont then they arent worth you caring what they think
well now im pregnant with his kid... how do i tell him without him going BALISTIC!!!???!!!???!!!
start by kissing, then start to do a little more.
It depends on the girl i guess, but i lie all the time and people really buy it :)
I wouldn't worry about the embarrasment factor there.
put your nose into her p...!
i know a women who was married to a jerk and he beat their kids.
find a new man if you care that much
If he gets the point, then stick it out...
keep that, you may find he is a really cool guy and want to stay friends
i dont know who you meet.
would you like it if your future husband cheated on you?
your charming smile baby, which costs nothing
if not someone will find u
well you can apologize,, but you can't have him back,, just accept what you already decided...
well in ur case im like ur g/f  n ur like  my husband !
because they are to in love and they think that theres hope
do not know, except that i am not on the list.
You know your man, if you trust him don't worry.
I can't think of ANY reasons.
There's hot and awesome guys that weigh over 250!
SHOULD I GO BACK OR STAY HOME?
better question... WHY IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND?
i dunno..i just know that i just gained 2pts.
otherwise its just something else that may lead to love you never know
I go out of my way for a married man.
Now im at 28 and single.
You marry becasue you want to spend the rest of your life with the man!
maybe, 90% she does and 10% she doesnt.
HOW COOL AND we should THANK HIM EACH DAY FOR WONDERFUL FEELINGS OF SEX!
Depends if you believe in books about what dreams mean I guess...
Let me guess: move to New Zealand?
To each their own BUT I'll still be eating my chocolates and enjoying my roses while you...........?
My friend old me this when I first saw that word
Bear in mind, that this guy hadn't been in a relationship for almost 9 years!
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WASTED YEARS OF MY LIFE BEING WITH TRASH LIKE YOU!!
As long as she isn't thier boss.
Yep, some are WAY OUT THERE.hello.
Yes, so that I can do the same to her!
If someone doen't ask you out, does that mean that you are unattractive or something????
1. marriage is not a joke!
he obviouly doesnt accept u for u so how can u stay with him no piont in being miserable.
Dance for him with something sexy!
I wanna do things to you I wouldn't even do to an oreo.
I'm 38 :-)  would anybody lie about that age ?
NEVER HIDE........... u might just loose them.
Wow, sounds great except for the 6 months thing, give it some time dude!
If ya want to make love for more than 5 min at a time.. Don't have kids..
If he did, he wouldn't cheat.
she's still probably living w/ her parents
y do it matter to u?
1ST OF ALL YOU CAN'T HELP WHAT YOU DREAM ABOUT, AND 2ND FANTASIZING IS JUST THAT, A FANTASY.
and it makes ppl more anxious and jealous, so beware of that too.
hahahaha yeaah right like I am going to post that kind of personal info
I guess you are queer, Just be your self, You can't please an Human Being.
if u dont doubt him anymore..  ur instincts r always d best sign
wait so he doesnt have a reason to hate you
What was that about now I am curious too.
Have you ever had a fallout like that?
if this boy like you you should go with him.
tell your friend to tell him that you like him.
it ain't over till the fat lady sings!
hell NO,  u must be smart
you get even by becoming a better person then you were before you met her.
Don't just go to him and say hey I wanna bone your sister really bad.
TRY BEING THE WOMEN THEN I AM SURE ULL FIND ONE.
I'VE BEEN WITH MY HUSBAND SINCE I WAS 19 AND I'M GOING TO BE 26 NEXT MONTH.
hang out with him a couple times and see what he is like
Falling in love (really in love) is just magical... until reality hits you in the head :-)
I am to busy to respond to that.. #2 would be....
probably so couldn't stay away from eachother long!
why dont you call her.send some valentines card!
Ask him where does he see his life going?
it is all about that dollar!
and really get to know her.
i started likin some1 i didnt before when they asked me out so just ask.
i think she likes me because of the flirting, and person talk that goes on, between us.
I don't want to be annoying!
But remember that dating doesnt have to mean being boyfriend girlfriend.
not all guys it depends on the guy.
sense of humor is very important
REPEAT AFTER ME....YOU ARE A LYING DIRT FACE!
Do not do it in private.
if you love a boy then tell hem
common, you want your cousin to love you.
once you have moved on then you wont care if he moves on or not.
because pain is pleaser, & when one bleeds it's like an orgasm!
:)  Seriously though, the best way is just to tell them.
may god and your fellow soldiers preserve you
THEN YOU KNO WAT TO DO......forgive.
Once a cheater always a cheater!
say back off bitch i hate u
I only care who she is now.
Realize mom and dad are happy being apart.
no but he see u more bitful at night cuz ur father is sleeping lol
Sometimes it really sucks, but it'll be when its meant to be.
are u wanting to get married?
I'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM SO MANY TIMES JUST STICK WITH BOTH OF THEM BUT JUST PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGTHT!!!!
If he wants to be friends thenso be it.
It's like your happy most of the time and you're always glowing.
marriage is better, no one said that it was going to be easy.
the gay guys love listening to them.
kiss her on the cheek first and if she knows what u mean shell carry on from there.. ;)
If she blows you off, forget it.
If you love someone then you sacrifice being with other people.
u cant put ur life to be all about her.
Think, what's her favorite resturaunt...cofee shop...vineard...etc.
Now you get two of everything.
But I would not agree that girls should attack first!
Maybe a hot bath for both of you!
so my suggestion to you is DONT GET SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING SERIOUS
It probably wasn't the brightest thing for him to tell you, but I wouldn't worry about it.
IF YOU TRULY IN LOVE YOU DONT WANT ANYTHING ELSE.
If my hubby cheated, I'd probably chop his thing off and hang it from the mustang's rearview mirror...
your a guy love is a very wierd thing.
dont compromise your salvation for anyone.
i have too much to live for.
Open it and ask her just like ya did here.
tell him that you love him&#92;her in any way.
Make it look like u want her like something else.
my bf notices so many girls when hes driving and he tries not to make it obvious.
treat him just like you would a good friend you have not seen in a long time.
would have sex with more than one guy at once?
Sometimes guys say that stuff to play you.
if i really think about it i want to be with both of them i guess.
dream of me for 4 years, then hop on my boat
to you what can a woman do say or look like in order to be sexy
crushing on a guy, and knowing he likes me too?
I loved this guy but after he humiliated me in front of 40 ppl, I dunno wat I feel!!
no,just leave him like a dog and he'll know how good you are!!
Of course, if it feels right.
Have I told... you lately... that I lub you...?
I dunno HOW il get over him.
I prefer a friend to whom I can talk!
We have had lots of in & outs.
If you dont mind being her backup then okay.
u dont take any precaution and u get pragnent
maybe u just need Mr.Just for Me
is it too far for u?
when you're both naked and in bed together
if you really like him you will just know.
you can stop trying to control her life?
my guy does he says that it gives him an oppunity to tell be how beautiful i am
(think about what that makes you look like to his friends?
well, I WOULD date a girl who was stripper, because I don't matter who she was.
no, he should not get married to her at this time.
But your bf isn't you bf.
I luv not having 2 worry about N E body but myself.
what is wrong with you ?
Oh, and if guys knew u said that nobody would like u, just so u know.
of course.. just tell him everything you know
(careful if hes a non-understanding homosapien)
... Oh yeah, a great sense of humor, good-natured and self-confidence.
i would not like to be the 7th guy if she thinks about the 8th
He's such a sweet heart but I tell ya, I've gotta question his thinking skills sometimes..lol.
pick me but be a little more specific on type or stereo i mean age counts too!
why does she want to look?
i dont like to hurt anyone.
Kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her!
MY BOYFRIEND OF ALITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW HAS CONTINUED TO LIE TO ME THROUGHOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.
Did he do it on purpose???
at least you can trust us cause even if we lie you'd know!
ask her why she in the relationship and how she feel about you
BECUASE THEY USUALLY JUST LIKE TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.
but to answer your question no there is no way to understand men.
I love my bf/childs father to death!
Obviously you decided you don't want to sleep with him or you would have already.
y cant they just treat us with respect?
which of course really pissed my off.
your suppossed to sign that thing????
god doesn't care about sexual procliviites, what a narrow way of thinking!
A nice yard wedding worked for me.
People freaked out about that, but I'm glad I married him.
only if your heart desires to, if your gut says run then do so
Once a cheat, always a cheat...
wait and see what she has to say.
Maybe he thinks its your fault that u have a baby.
no offense to any good men out there
however i really do love her.
but i am unsure of that.
and DO NOT  encourage your girlfriend to become a stirpper.
my bffl went ut w/ a really short guy and they even kissed.
If he says sure hye's not cheating.
she likes u like a bother
If I do then why would I be snooping around In his stuff?
Maybe its because he is not lonely.
no, that makes u the girl of my dreams!!!
Kick his ass and get rid of him.
i here a coat hanger and a vacuum will do the job
he doesn't love you, break up with him and don't even listen to his excuses!
You see her looks and thats it!
if u dont u'll never have contact with him.
being good all the time is boring.
We have hormones too, you know!
no, unless you feel you need to doubt that.
SWEET HEART I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
got anything better to do the rest of your life than trying to understand them?
right then is when you need to relax for a while.
SOMETIMES I COME BACK TO MY HOMETOWN TO GET AWAY WHICH IS ACROSS COUNTRY TO WHERE HE IS.
have sex right before you go to bed
try yes if u like him and no if u dont!
But if I had to choose...Black... White men just don't do it for me..
and depends on if he likes war games or sports or role playing ect...
I don't want him as a boyfriend anymore.
I guess becuase they are loved, if not they wouldn't find it.
the coaches were more laid back and i usually played over half the game.
they just think differantly than you.
it can even help your relationship
Just keep going till you hit the next Level i.e Level 4
I speak idiot, gruntinees and jabberwocky..maybe I can help PM me
mayhaps you should travel to the uk and find this out.
okay, most of the girls in your campus hate him.
Like ours go to their breasts.
Dump the one you have (Trust me: She'd be shocked!
Open your mouth and say something!
Give her something really nice and then ask right there on the spot.
who the fuck can i answer if i don't even know if u are a boy or girl.
love is not rare dont worry and dont be the bit*ch ok?
SHE SHOULD DECIDE TO PREVENT GETTING PREGNANT.
If he's cheating then kick him to the curb.
start from the day of your wedding.
of course i have plenty of friends who are guys......yet i have plenty of friends that are girls.
ur future is not bright it;ll leads u to death.
but if ur worried about it cuz there's no commitment u guys should talk first.
I hate wearing flats and I won't do it just to make a guy feel better.
if he loves you, he will be heartbroken, but he will get over it.
y do u marry him when he's quiet and noe u want him to talk to u?
I see it online everywhere.. i was just wondering
So if you havent slept together yet...don't.
WHAT KIND OF FATHER DOES THAT MAKE HIM???
Go hang around with some really rough men, you know, a ' man's man'
the problem is, i dont know if she likes me.
I don't like a big cry baby though!
it means that she likes you as a brother
That only works in bad teen movies!
perhaps... but obviously not enough feeling for her to leave his wife.
If not, stay with your sister!
alright, the way it's always worked for me is to go out with a friend.
Do he still like me r is he playing games
I don't like the way they cus.
the problem is, how can i say no and still remain good friends?
some are 'snugglers', some are not.
i invited her over and we went inside my room and i shut the door lol.
i think so for romantic love plus its really fun
Did u watch movie The Game?
Just don't tell her you love her too early.
i want work to be over with today and forever!
remember the good times and forget the bad but it takes time
i saw them last year they were great etc
she's not even in college yet, and u want 2 have a serious relationship?
if u cant do that then maybe u can email him.
the more you think about here the more you want here.
at times i think only sex.
it should be elaborate, public, and show her really how much she means to you....  GO FOR IT!!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  but it can make it alot worse!!
maybe d love wasnt really that much when u got married.. u just thought it was!
B/c then when one hurts u, o well u hav another to fall bac on.
Tell her to try asking him out or something.
Lovin up with some skeezer tramp.
....if she doesn't like you enough to remain only with you, it's not worth it.
You should go out with a guy you like.
she cant stop you from seeing your little man.
a real man would not have to bribe you to kill your child.
i would stop calling and see if he misses you and calls you!
you daughter is acting stupid and you should tell her so,  then shut up.
maybe the same way you told us!
if i didnt have kids i would die for the one i love.
Why so many men dream about living with an asian girl.
PLEASE HELP:  WHAT DO I DO??
cheat on her with one of her friends and treat her friend better than u treated her
tell her not to see any bad guys!!!
Wow, alot of my friends' girlfriends ask me this same question.
still trying to figure that one out myself
well try kissing him...are there any sparks?
yeah my boyriend is crazy abou my toes!
do this either before he leaves or when you first see him.
make it slow and steady... opss i'm a man...
are you hearing your self out?
tell him what you want, basicly, and lead him,
can't he get a girl to share hers with him?
you get bored easily when with him/her.
You know what you should do.
Sorry but my magic 8 Ball says NO
well one day i sat him down and told him i liked him.
She asked me about my feelings...
WELL ALL DEPENDS ON HOW LONG YOU BEEN WITH HER .
because if u knew that, u might try to do or be that.
you just opened a can of worms!..lol.
if she wants to, she will when shes free.
There is no way that that's the problem.
The dress, and brides maids dresses might take you a month alone LOL
Later on that month things started changing.
I would say that is not okay because just because hes a guy doesnt mean that its right!!
i'd go wit jamookae ,hz gt serious emotional issues!
i was thinking about how to kiss her next time:)
this my opinion,that's whow i think about this!
Yes there are, I am not one of them.
WHY SHOULD U KILL THAT INNOCENT BABy
She's just not that into you.
be nice and relaxed and let her know that you like her.
then they might come after you or it was just not ment to be.
step 2: if you don't see any result after 3 weeks.
9 out of 10 times, what you like seeing him in, isn't what he is comfortable in.
But I'm not the one who did anything wrong.I love him so much what should I do?
Remember, just because a guy knows your involved, doesnt mean he wont try anyway.
roses are red,  violets are blue.
!, and HEELLL NOOO, it's not wrong, do what you gotta do
Perhaps his wife doesn't seduce him the way she used to.
ya I care, but its not everything
he'll understand and think nothing of it.
You marry the one you can't live without.
yes find your next boyfreind .dam there are alot of lonly peoples out there move on
you have to basically overdose to get off.
If someone used sex toys and it wasn't good then it didn't help them.
Sorry its always gona be aucword and kinda weiro ish.
So how do I get it to come out again?
if I knew who she was i could help.
not just honest but honorable........... ie not a cheater or player
I like school teachers...but I'm not one.
i wear glasses and i have had boyfriends.
If I had met the woman of my dreams she would be everything I need.
After I busted him cheating of course.
Don't make yourself sound so disgusting....and cheap...  Married men are off limits...
I love to dream, about different men, I guess it's okay.
straight up tell them and at the right moment.not whn there is a bunch of ppl around
30 is pretty young to be gaining a lot of weight.
just stand firm and tell him it's over.
you are too young and too many things can go wrong.
he got what he wanted... he is done with you.
And if not the pet store... just look around the barns.
No, if you already free him in you're life and find another girl.
If I knew, I'd be in front of you!
I don't know you to love you!
It's too late, you missed your chance, and she has moved on now.
Guaranteed there is someone who likes her that she's missing because she's obsessed with this other guy.
so you like a lesbian and your not a lesbian that makes no sense what so ever
Just hit me up and we'll talk about this one.
Instead of telling him -show him what you like...
most will if they get the chance but your not married so .............its about 99% i think
