he's being stalked
tell her to move on with her life
you won't be able to do it
If he really doesn't know the women. then it shoudln't matter
he'll love u more
my wife gave me a peck, then took off with the kids
my email's jakb6hsm@yahoo.com, I like new ppl
I dunno, maybe I just can't lie much
Matt made it easy for me to decide on him.
The beach sounds good, but so does dinner at a nice restaruant.
That's not enough to tell you he doesn't love you......hand in there.
When people pretend to not be insterested when they really are, they are just playing games with you.
I was born to do it doggy style.
the other Saturday I had to pretend to be both a male and female six times.
it will be hard if he doesn't notice you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
you should hit him on the head.
if you have to ask questions of that nature, then, you should go out and get that job.
talk to him first.
dont think alot bout it
then i come back and its the same shit
even if ur a beginner if she likes u wont matter
um yeah, need to break up w/him
asked her to dance now were friends!
i  reccommend that you call her and inform her of your feelings for her.
it is good that you are experiencing new things.
what they said is true.
you will loose it if you do not use it.
do not be late, someone else may take the opportunity.
Ok, but are you in love?!?
But he says he don’t care about you.
get someone else to tell him for you.
i believe he was a friend once.
you sister may have a suitable solution for you problem.
that depends on your gender.
are you implying that I am not a good person?
earth chock full o girls
drop it and have you sum fun
if you like her whats it matter.
why she miss someone that dont beling ta her.
no one can ever be exactly what you are.
you feel them, not see them.
do not worry about those types of things.
it is exciting, especially when he makes you feel the way that you do.
as a male, I think it relates to sex.
why are men stronger, tougher, and more honest and hardworking?
aquery which resulted in your hysterical reaction.
you should not marry her, she is using you to her benefit.
you will need good luck.
dont ask him out, drive him crazy until he asks you
look over the pics of young guys
one of 3 possibilities, ur boring, hes wanting a break, or hes sleeping with someone else
you can do this if you want but you shudnt.............. you deserve so much better
not sure cuz my fiance and me are both like that
she will love you all the more if you love and trust her.
i make so much noise our neighbors have made complaints against us.
well, he won't be in a marriage for a significant future period.
i think the same thing about wrestling.
you will feel it, and that is when you will know.
correct, it is the French that was being employed by all. However, this also serves the purpose.
if you find the answer to that question, please let me know.
are there any other concerns that you shouldn't attempt to date him.
listen to your intellect and emotions.
jealousy is a difficult emotion to overcome.
IMHO, it would be neat.
I'm a guy; you can trust me hon.
for sure,  ask ur big sister again
read this story and then say WHATEVER you can to get her to STOP!!!!!
My bf is not like that. He just starts and goes to town on it lol.
check my ?s click on my avatar - identical!
hes just got a shitton of chick friends im lost
i think having a bae is awesome!
one day, just plant a kiss on him!
i want her back bad bad bad!
at least hes including you!
seducing a woman is like winning a trophy, dude.
Tell him to eff off.
Get a valentine's day rose bouquet for her and invite her on a date.
There's no rule that says you HAVE TO ask her to be your girlfriend.
if you think he is attractive and have feelings for him, try asking him out.
if it is during intercouse, I do not think that she is a virgin.
you can contact me at erkannss14@hotmail.com, then we can talk about this more later.
there is not even free lunch, or even fireworks.
i enjoy receiving advice.
be normal dude
its toughto talk w/her
srsly asking via text- messed up
plannin is a good thing just not too much
you are her life
1st time i had to help someone like this... HELP!
its not fair that a guy cant talk to another chick without his gf thinking he's cheating
I chatted with the guy for like 2 hrs.
you're soooo green!
that means u like yourself
no matter what stand up for YOURSELF!!!
It's the same reason why a lot of women are slow.
Try that & your life will be over!
I have a desire to but I don't want to w/o thinking.
Each week is not the same..before all else look for signs like eye contact & flirting
Love conquers all in the end so dont be worried sweetie!
trust me i am a pro at relationships
i make sure i ask a guy out if i am interested, don't need any other woman scooping him up
well that takes time to develop
remember even unattractive men like bill gates can still land a woman
God says to love one another, he doesn't judge it by gender.
When men go out in public they want a nice girl on their arm but when they get home, they want a tiger in the bedroom
I'm not certain but I think if you show him you care and cook him diner it may work.
Either ask him or one of your friends.
She's not that into you.
It's not the size of the ship, it's the motion of the ocean.
I don't care about my boyfriend's stuff.
You should hook up with his friend and see how he likes that!
You need to work on that.
Let's do something fun after school.
It's time to get serious with her she's acting like a 2 yr old.
Men suck at lieing, women are much better at it.
Everyone thinks you are a jerk.
Once you do that, see if he still wants to be around you.
you cannot just force yourself on anyone, or you will end up with noone.
do not act as though you are pure.
i suggest that you introduce yourself.
i will try anything once, and I will do it again if I enjoy it.
Don't do nothing.
He is more wise cuz he's 3-5 years older.
Sesriously!? YOu want to be with that kind of person for the rest of your everlastin' life???
I think if your gut says something is off, then it's off.
Don't be an idiot, try to be normal in the brains department.
Nowadays, almost everyone has gone past 1st base with sex.
Bottom line, it's pickin' my future mate.
Both are fine, but it will just depend on how we are feeling that day
He a liar and hangs up in the middle of when Im talking.
If you take too long, youll never get anywhere
Is he being stupid and ruining his life?
Nah but whose really happy anyways
do you like someone asking you for a date?
everything reminds me of him and what it used to be.
although you said it was mutual, I expect he would go to jail here.
after one month, I can fall in love.
if you don't find him trustworthy, then how can you two love each other?
lol he keeps trying to make me jealous like why?
what are they gonna say?
if you rent make sure someone gets pic and video
thanks i'll let him know she'll do it again im sure
I'm not worried about it
are u guys still a thing??
Like it or not.. fake it till u make it!
set the mood with some barry white stuff. It works.
not required to have a relationship.
I'm a 20 year old girl.
Too much of a good thing can be bad.
You just want to be you.
It's OK to cry if you talk to her.
It's about the one you're with.
Become friends with the women first, it my thought.
i'd be upset if I got that same kiss today
My girlfriend is my love, my everything, she is perfection.
It ain't easy to find friends.
My ex did that same shit to me
A small amount of each.
Act normal and see the results
You're gonna say "You're not able to hurt me no more" when you get mad.
Go and get those breasts reduced and youll look slick!
There's none left for you, pal.
If someone wanted to send me nude pics, I wouldn't dump my GF for them.
He's only talking to you, don't run away.
Its tacky to cheat on someone then write a note about it.
do not speak with him, he is not the man for you. He's giving you terrible advice.
i made the right choice because I see him once in a while.
he is a 23-year-old guy who is a virgin.
it is dependent upon whether or not you still care for her.
you should not be having sex in the first place.
it is alright for you to like him even if others do not.
he even had intercourse with the wife of his best friend.
they are very nice.
and what does it mean?
who can assemble me again?
imo definitely no! unless ur bestie tells u its ok
just leave them alone ur not getting anywehre wit them
the way i see people is the way i want to see them
i didnt want to feel so lonely anymore thas y i did what i did
i bet they feel the same way bout girls
not all girls, but some sure do.
yea, if they won't answer the question, or get mad....RED FLAG!
If he truly loved you, he would have supported your choice, no matter what. Not talk you into getting an abortion.
wait, what did he say? that he didn't love you?
I wish you were here with me.
why do men continuously lie?
Don't waste time with her mind games, move on!
Make sure you're clean and tidy.
Don't hang out with loosers.
Watch what you're doing or you'll be sorry later.
My life would be complete if I married the woman of my dreams.
I have gone to a few before.
I have hung out with big dudes.
Contrary to popular belief, most dudes are not dumb.
Mine is wayyy huge!
You should know if she digs you, Bro.
Are you sure this is what you want?
He wasn't meant for you if he walks away.
When are you going to watch the Paris Hilton video?
I want a man I can love.
Both of you need to be understanding and flexible.
I don't like a lot of hair on a man's chest but a little is ok.
Just tell your family that he makes you happy.
You should be there for her if she thinks she looks good
Nope, I waited til I got asked out.
He has a wife!
Tell them how you feel, and see if they feel the same.
You have every right to be mad.
Do you really want to be with someone who has no clue of what he wants?
My friends don't like him, and always make fun of him.
you are big time evil
the hard part is getting him to stay with you
so text him aleady!
your a sinner if you aint a virgin
i getg he's like 14 to 16, so what about you?
attractive, happy and mature describes you
sometimes men do bad things
dont bring it all covered in hair
look for someone who wants to spend the rest of their lives with you
he loves u because u are his one
he prob thinks its a good thing
B.O., farting, and burping completely turn me off!
i still think alot about him after all this time
See what he says... Ask him out
it was a completely different time with differnt gurls
you can't change them... trust me!
you don't need him or anyone else to put you down
I was a virgin on our wedding night so i no he loves me more
Get a plane ticket and go get married if ur really in love!!
Watching a woman masturbate turns me on and i like to have sex with her right after
Why don't you tell her how you really feel.
Men can't be friends like women can.
Just be a cool dude and don't take girls for granted all the time.
deep inside u r STRONG!!!
shell make a move and break off the realtionship
how long have u been married?
ask him if hes willing to put family into a priority position
that's another story altogether!
would i show my hubby the door?
i hear that men want women who have never done "it" before.
you gotta problem with this?
I'm sorry but I cant give you advice since I don't live there.
If those "friends" are unsaved, you are a sinner.
Go to the movies or sight seeing or something like that.
We meet a lot and feel the same.
Tell her you want to share it with her.
If I found i wanted it, I'd want it over and over again.
If he did it once, don't be fooled into thinking he won't try it again.
You need to dump her like the load of garbage she is.
I like him a lot and miss him when he's not around.
what is wrong with enjoying yourself?
I sure hope not, I already have a lot of issues with gays going after me.
My friends said she loves me.
There must be reason why she eats like that.
Does this sound familiar to you at all?
They just want somebody to love them.
I want her to like me.
My racist family hated the fact we were a mixed-race couple. My dad and great grandpa were mad.
I meant to say beauty is only skin deep.
because the color red is the color of blood but most people consider blue to be the color of love.
do you really want him back in your life?
you just use the restroom from there, and did not even wipe yourself?!
you would do best to leave him and strike out on your own.
That sucked.  Not ever gonna have the tv on when we're getting it on.
youll def be a awesome sister
one day he just began to flirt w/ me
men are gonna be pissed your into him and not them
why make some big deal of it, it's totally normal
Listen, you gotta tell him in person!!
I didn’t even get off, the headboard thing messed up the mood.
I love my wife sooooo much!!!
Ask him to hang out if they do.
iam 26 years old and I waited until marriage to have sex.
do they hold the opinion that he lacks confidence?
he does not want to use a condom.
do you imagine she'll be aware of your affection independent of your revelation to her?
i cannot because I am starting to fall in love.
girls like it when you are odd.
someone you love will always be there whether you are happy or sad.
then you can certainly do these things together!
It's EZ, just say NO!
Did you give it your best effort?
a man can work form sun up to sun down, but a womans job is never done.
that description sounds surprisingly similar to flirtation.
the female you are partial towards will be alone, and she states that that is less than desirable.
i like him but I do not love him.
it doesn't matter if you're doing everything accurately.
You never know if you two are good for each other unless you try.
Let him know what you want!
YOu startin to hate the friends of you boo.
Want to know how I got over thiss?
Put yourself out there, its' worth it.
This dude was stalking me.
i think that sex is supposed to be about giving unselfishly rather than getting something for oneself.
inform her that were she to feel romantically towards you, she would visit and engage in wild sexual intercourse and ingest your ejaculate.
it is like suicide, it is normal to think about it, but not to act upon those thoughts.
my male friends say confidence is key.
if he truly cared about you, the little things would matter to him.
Hes just on my mind all the time
that knot websire has loads of ideas
ur married! whats the deal?
he'll ask you to marry him know it
i want a man's whose comfortable in his own skin
you can do whatever floats your boat
the ones you don't expect are the ones that come from the heart
i you die for her 'cause if she died i wouldn't wanta live anymore
if he does not do what you want, discipline him.
i know that he also would not want me to do it.
don't tell him that you want to have intercourse.
be concerned when he sees someone else.
i do not know about love.
i am humbly (and laughingly) stating that I have all the qualities you have mentioned.
i would not necessarily break off a friendship simply because we have a disagreement.
in Yahoo! Chat, I communicate quite a bit in that forum.
Guys that want 1 thng from you are a dime a dozen, you'll gt used to it.
Hold out for a math genious, there's nothing they don't know about curves.
Get that thing snipped!
One day you wake up and you've got it all figured out.
No kidding... I'm married an figured that out long ago.
you need to take precautions before you get preggo
break up with him if he is trying to control you
i dont like the bad boy type but i dont know how you feel
they will accept your flaws if they love you
love is love god doesnt care
thats not fair to the guy your dating.
i hate that type, you can't buy class, style or grace,
depends on the size of the dick.
i tried to talk to him but he wont call me back.
my guy works out and his butt is fantastic!
maybe you shouldn’t doubt him?
He’s got no reason to feed you, grow up!!!
if you want to be with him then do it.
just ask him how he feels, it’s bettwr to get it over with!
If you're in Bangalore, I am here.
I'm always happing....waking up this morning, and at work now.
You need to ask yourself if you have feelings for him!
Stop trying that if she isn't willing.
But, I;ve learned that a dude will show it if he likes you likes you.
when you feel differently you won't talk to her
My guy friends are like my bros. No tension btw us at all.
What were u up to in that class??
i'd ask her if she's into u or not
That's really damn rude of her to do in frant of you.
I am seem to be attracted to shitheads. Why am I so effed in the head?
Give your prayers to Jehova God and Jesus Christ as your final choice!
Take her on a date, maybe take her shopping or something.
I promise that every girl who thinks she is a sex addict has no actual clue about it.
It's gonna cost you 3 points for every answer.
I think that's not true and that you are just sex addicts.
Let him be because he got what he wants and might not want to talk anymore.
i could please use some advice from other people.
your chile wants you to be present, and sending money is not preferrable to that.
don't simply stand around waiting for a good thing.
i need advice, my wife and I cannot conceive.
it depends on the mood of my wife is in at the time.
Two failed relationships...first one was love and first site and then died, second one is slowly going down the tubes.
SEnd me an email and I'll spill the beans.
You know the answer.... his heart belongs to someone else.
Show some confidence, it's a sexy trait!
He's either crazy or just ins't thinkin strait.
Keep away until this calms them down.
Guys don't cheat if they're happy with their sex life.
Take it slow and her body should do all the talking
Chocolate and attention r all girls want
I HATE words like that!!!!
it just depends on ur age
love others and they will love you.
You made a mistake, he decided to ask you out
he need to know that  you have to respect each other equally.
If you put in, you will get out.
You ever commit a crime, like a felony.
The amount of success you get in life and finding love is the reason for success.
Pretend to be a woman looking for a job with the NSA and send him an IM
your partner gets hurt when you go out and have fun without him or her
I want my exbf back
Wow, that must have sucked
Some guys really don't like people touching their asses.
Love can be confusing to people until they actually fall in love.
How long into the first date until that happened?
Not all dudes only care about sex.
They are probably acting out for a reason.
my butt is not chicken like thank you
Im a woman only think about having sex w/man if im in love
maybe he likes u if he has friends
i want it back if you find it please let me know
he's a creep and he's going to cheat on you like he did your cousin
its inconsiderate not to return the favor
please let me know if you see him
what is a relationship if you cannot discuss such subjects?
i don't believe it's a sin, although it terminates in fornication.
but have fun if you decide to do it.
Compared to most guys you are obsessed with virginity.
And love for 8 years with my boyfriend and now it's over.
That opened my eyes to a few things
how do you feel about marriage?
Can i get custody even if he's been taking care of the kid?
i believe you have a boyfriend.
IT can work for you too.!:)
they are no longer best friends.
we never got together, though, because he regarded me as his best friend.
He even basically adopted my baby daughter as his own!
Chill on all the money spending.
find out what you dont want to do
get involved in her stuff even if its not your thing it gives you a change to get to know her
that sounds weird, is she hiding something?
it all depends on the mood that you are in, there are so many factors.
most men are in constant need of intercourse.
are you able to handle a serious relationship?
let her be in the front to observe her reaction
did you read what you wrote ?
you're the best at it.
if you keep flirting and caring about him you will get to know him much better.
it's my choice in the end
no matter how long it takes to stop caring about them.
i can loan you a few dollars.
should I discontinue our relationshp or continue it in the hope she indeed loves me?
to surprise her, tell her in the middle of a conversation.
it seems to me that love does not die so quickly.
i don’t think he likes me the way i am liking him.
I WANT it more then MEN do.
Come walk a mile in MY shoes.
what in tarnation can I do?!?
females want everythang from males.
if you want to listen to more, send me an email.
i agree, but I don't feel that it is a poor decision.
she can see how happy you are because she has realized what she has thrown away.
Just one, the first and last.
It's hard to be friends after you've been more than friends.
We're friendly but not enough to kiss.
If it doesn't fit and brings pain, it's too long.
Men, you cant train em to drop the toilet seat or change thier minds once made up.
he wants you to do this becuz it gives him permission in his mind that is to cheat.
I'd be worried he's cheating on you, just saying.
I try to be fair but NO. dont call me a weak person.
She wants to show ya she doesnt want anyone but you.
he's a guy, thats what they do
i offered him a second chance, but he passed
he will become envious. Tell him you hate that as well.
Could be that becoming fixated after sex scares men away
sweetie, if you don't want to have sex with a man, that's fine.
You got yours, does it matter?
It's hard to erase those memories
I'm Shaba, I want to be friends with somebody from Amsterdam.
Girls like strong men, not wimps.
You need to be safe about it.
Some guys just aren't the same.
if you are being yourself and they do not like you, they do not deserve you.
if they make you happy, you fine with no flirting.
it is simple:; purchase a flower for him and tell him that you love him.
do you still love him?
keep your main boyfriend, and then go and find you a side lover!
ur mom made you move out, so she can't tell you what to do anymore
it's the only thang that serious girls take seriously
I'm assuming u've tried to talk to him?
since he just wants to be friends, u should just move on
don't let other tric u
y r u being mean if they r  being nice
Get rid of him if he continues to keep harassing you.
Hugging him was not the best thing to do at the time. It was not the best solution.
As of yet, I have not met Mr. Right who is the right person for me.
I am very mature person, so don't fool with me!
Why are they keeping it from you?!?
there's a wolf and a lab
send him a note from vacation
You're going to find someone else and wonder why you ever cared about him
If you want to meet a women try the library or walmart
yup its do-able, 'cause I do it all the time
lets be real, you want him to propose
a girl whose checking you out is testing you
thaks for helping w/ wedding plans
the more you give, the more he's gonna grab
you will not be disappointed if you try it sometime.
you really should find a younger guy to date.
no, I would prefer the woman who rejected me die suddenly. I will not care about her at all anymore.
the ego is very conflicting.
I think it probably depends mostly on you and circumstances my friend.
Girl, make your own decision up.
The secret admirer clues sure do look like they point to you!
I don't think he will ask you out if you already dumped him, unless he is completely desperate!
oh no plz tell me you are not pregnant?!?
go out with him, ask him!!!!!
yeah if shes drinkin just dont meet her
MY LADY WZ A DUDE WTF
be nice & friendsly not all up in their biz
wait hey u r on a cd, yeah? u famous!
Life is people hurting each other.
They need to be feeling the loving and ready to share!
Tell him the truth. He probably won't give a crap.
We've been chatting almost a half a year.
I hope ya find soem new buds.
I saw that too when I was out there.
well the reasons cuz guys and girls are different hormonally
im into girls with a cute butt and small chest
i don't think i can not be a jealous girlfriend
if its been that long just say no
they don't have minds of their own its not your fault
Is the kids dad involves.
why he locked up
you should state that you have enough friends.
you will not meet anyone who wants to have a serious relationship unless you have a big penis.
they must accept it.
my friend hasn't the slightest idea, that she has ruined my life.
Syou have to move on with your life and find someone new.
I don't see any reason why guys can't have girls as friends.
He will be so happy!!! OMG!!
Can you see that? Wow, I could stare at that all day!
not going to give u a pity lay
do most people just have sex w/bf then?
has nothin to do w.you thou
u make the 1st move
who knows? it's all up to u!
NOPE unless they said they're back on...
she's not into you, or you may have came on too strong
Nope not weird at all
u can't stop thinking about someone u love
You're 40, you need someone who's the same.
When people get hitched, they end up acting dumb and mean.
My guess is he's screwing around with somebody else.
The way things are will make things one way or another.
Could we go on a date if I wasn't a girl?
It benefits all kinds of people, not just lovers.
I wonder if I'd ever put myself in harms way for someone else?
i am curious as to what this was all about.
you attempt to maneuver its direction at a measured pace. No man enjoys learning of his own sub-par kissing skill.
it cannot be done. If they care about you, then it will hurt no matter how you phrase it,
ewe want to get to know eachother better.
he is about 14-16 years old, and he has a crush on me.
Yeah, it’s gonna be hard but just act like you don’t care.
Just so she knows-tell her you love her
What do you look for when a man is flirting with you?
Ask her and see if she tells you the truth
Flirt first and then say you love em
move on dude all u got is time
he was all looking for the razor and then screamed bloody murder
likely she wouldn't havve left you if you were less erratic in the past
kick him to the curb, you are wasting your life staying with him
we couldn't think of a better thing to do
my sister got knocked up by him but is still pregnant with his seed
you gotta get her something meaningful
She doesn't want to get ahold of you anymore.
Ok ladies: do you ever use those cosmetic samples at the mall?
These young ladies still have hope.
do not say that because most men are not of low intelligence.
tyes, I will not be in a relationship with a large man.
i know that he is Jim.
Sentence: It is when she infrequently has sex with you.
don't have intercourse with him for a little bit, it will drive him crazy.
man just stared off in another directon.
mr. is crushin on me.
I get hangry twice daily.
She don't know you need help until you ask.
It's in spots where POC hang.
by the way, there are plenty of commercials that will tell you condoms are not adequate protection, but something is better than nothing!
can you please look into it for me?
she might be able to pretend with other things, but that is one thing she can not fake.
but it really depends on the woman and her confidence in her natural beauty.
however, exclusively on occasions when they're sexually inclined or if you add spice to the occasion.
best you can do to get back at him, ignore him and move on
just be a lyaoal & friendy & nice & sweet person
no matter How pissed she gets, dont chnage it
Doesnt always matter the way u use it
we do our best to make women feel comrofortable
By the way, his penis is tiny
What kind of girlfriend is she really, and what are you doing to help fix the trust issue?
Especially if you are used to having lots of sex.
They think one way about everything.
Unless he is gay, go ahead and tell him.
Have I told you lately that you're ridiculously hot?
This is a silly question, you shouldn't ask questions like that.
They aren't as mature as we are.
not love, but really, who truly knows?
He isn't a crack-head or anything like that.
Any man that shuns responsibility is a jellybacked coward.
Hell and heaven are all around you. all you need to do is just observe.
I don't fully understand all of what you said, but I definitlely know it is spot on.
i had the pleasure of reading what you received, but thank you for the information.
have fun or stay busy.
only if you feel like you are in need of a boyfriend.
men are hunters, just like dogs. They enjoy the hunt but prefer the chase. So run.
what can I do to find out if my boyfriend is in love with me?
this ? makes peeps know u single
shy or scared either one thats me
be careful thats a dangerous path
gonna stop you from doin fun things w/people

Don't get yourself tied down, just go out and have a blast.
If you undress in front of him you'll know right away.
If you have any recommendations for me that would be great.

Do you think women give head once they are married?
It is all up to you.
Find better men to date, I expect her to do that too.

If it makes you happy, do it.
Good looking guys have an attitude mostly

Ain't no way to get that info.

It's fulfilling, not boring.

No1 understands the real problems until they're married and have kids.
Why do some gals have hair on their faces?
No, they can't because they're hot for  each other deep down inside.
He likes to flirt because he's hott.
Where do I go to if I need help.
He'll get a girl that loves and cares for him.
If he says no, he won't help.
Feel better, because things will be.

he still acts like that sometimes.
So, have you cheated on her?
If you like her, compliment her on her hair, outfit, shoes, whatever!
If a guy did that to me, I'd be OUT!
Naturally, it depends upon the guy.
You just answered the question you asked.
If you think so, odds are that he is.
To whow your appreciation, let them know that you care.

he clearly is attempting to engage a different female, therefore, I would withdraw.
Break it off but be cool about it.
Ya, right, like I'd ever pack my husbands bag... as if!
Get over it! Get on with your friggin life!
Don't be stupid like I was.
I get it, I have that problem too.
I was disgusted when my chick bit off my tip and ate it.
I' have issues with my boyfriend taking another chick out to lunch on v-day
Being overweight accounts for the second highest killer in the nation when it comes to the younger generation.
If you find her it will happen once again.
If I just knew what the correct response was...
Visit some resort that's MEANINGFUL TO HER
AND SHE wants nobody talking about anything that's going on.
Go to Yahoo messenger and look for pao_sky2000 and send me an IM
Like i was two years back...
He said he doesn't love you cause you only called twice?
I think tons of things are really important.
Make her happy with sex too.
I know lots of nice guys.
if you keeping looking for you're prince you'll find him
even though its OK to do it, you don't need to tell your partner you're thinging about it!
you need to get that shy is a downer, and people find you more exciting if you ain't
i did this like every day for a while
just throw it out, casual-like
they are very untruthful.
being intimate with a friend, cab create a rift in the relationship.
find a woman who has similar interests as you.
if you truly care for this person then you ought to try it.
just curious as to whether any women have advice about having sexual relations for the first time?
no but if ur friend wants to watch ok
Tough being 8 isn't it?
bigger bed or marriage counselor is what u need
gotta have sex like agua and air
you gotta feel me it will suck
they been together like 10yrs
yeah those friends will talk behind ur back
state and federal grants you dont have to pay back
The internet’s wrong!!
You don’t need special shoes.
If he can’t sit with you then your just friends.
If he can’t lick it, he can’t stick it!!
who broke it off?
i would say Adam and Eve, but they were smart.
i am taken aback by the size of your ego.
it is easy to make a cake.
no. enter reality, this is not a place to communicate freely.
why can't you just do this one thing?
if he loves her, then why not be in a relationship with her?
tell him he is the boss, or leave him to find someone else.
get to a doctor if you have not already.
whether my friends agree with this or not, I believe as a friend, I am irreplaceable.
catch him or her off guard by telling them that you love em.
he always appoligizes but he keeps on doing the same things over and over.
my guy is like a government mule, always farting and bleching, lol.
if he only likes you for what you do then trying doing stuff that he dont like and see how he acts.
you will never know if you don't tell him the truth.
It's just destined to be.
God loves you first and then love them
you should think long and hard.
When i fell to my knees i shall never forget that strange moment
will u play this for me-BabyBaby stay Gone by Jimmy Wayne
making out is my thing love it
dont do anything unless u want 2
had a hot hubs but he was rude as hell, divorced him
if u both can wait, totally worth it
leave him alone or u will get into trouble
Love isn't scary at all. If you're scared, you aren't in love.  The right guy will come along. Good luck.
You can date immediately if you want.
Your mom threw out he wrong person
You want a special night? Don't get edible panties.
It's not for you.
Women don't like to be pressured so don't try to force them.
Yeah but I don't want to.
We sat on my bed together and I looked into her eyes as I went in for a kiss.
Just see what happens. The timing may not be right for you to find the "one".
You can either choose to get along or not to.
i look good and love porn and oral sex not prude
normally when it rains the waves dont get that big
u dont want to talk to him anymore
It's not really like that, but getting pregnant could lead to defects.
If you just tell her upfront, you won't be hiding it and it will save fights down the road.
Don't date her again.
If women don't think you're hot it's because of their issues, not yours.
I have no idea what to do with them both.
Sounds like his boss was always putting him down.
Look him straight in the eys and the truth will come out.
Men like younger women, it's a running theme with us.
If he can't get over this without killing himself, that's totally up to him.
He tried to off himself and like a dope, I showed up at the hospital to offer my support.
p.s., I didn't mean that as a criticism, I'm not trying to stick a label on ya
don't let sex screw things up
men are ppl too ya know, women aren't the only ones w/feelings
women and men are different, ya know
it has several different meanings.
sure, if you get up off your butt!
a guy is a guy
Not all men are but, there are still men that do.
Whatever, at least mine do live.
She has to be jealous for a reason!
he doesn't like kids?  that's a bad deal
She only did it once.
You're bi if you like both guys and girls!
I love a nice round a** on a guy!
whats the point if u dont want to marry?
Im into doggy style imo
if u like her go ahead
Give him some love and affection!
I couldn't believe her eyes until I saw them.
I've been with her since I was 15, 9 months ago.
If you're horny, have sex.
Hope she doesn't care I've been with other girls.
the man didnt do it to u
can't u just talk without soundin like ur accusin someone
my man luvs me...i hope urs does 2
i live in romania...u should come see me
be married if that is what you want.
you had an intimate interlude with her, she is the boss, and that is just that.
i believe he didn't, because he feels terrible.
he is a jerk, but he says he wants to be with me.
iif you are truly her friend, then, you would not even consider it!
congratulations to the bride and groom, she is a lucky girl!
you are, however, too good for her in any event.
post a sex video about yourself, it pay.
dont matter what she looks like.
i dont think that the chickens really care about that.
when she tried to swipe her cards, she found out they were cancelled.
get her valentine's presents even if valentines is over, esp. if she is a romantic type of girl.
do you have a desire to be criticized as unintelligent?
i want to try something a little more exciting.
If you aren't turned on, sex will be uncomfortable.
No, he only likes to talk to you.
wait and see what happens if you think it will lead to heartbreak
You don't love her cuz you don't know her!!!
been there done that.
How could u rationalize doing somethin like this and telling others?
I hope it all works out, either finding that loved one or someone new.
however, they need not be partially unclothed.
protect yourself from getting pregnant if you are not ready to become a mother.
you should be more careful next time and prevent yourself from being hurt.
just have some fun and do not let it bother you, play the field!
Ladies do it too, I think.
It is benefecial to not have sex with a lady if she is hideous.
you'll find one to love
Everything is sweeter when your in love.
did she do it to you?
just let her know u love her & find cahs
just tell her take that chance
b4 my yahoo chat name was oscreamifyoudoitright
what should you do if your boyfriend hasn't called or messaged you in three weeks?
this is how my wife makes me pay attention.
there is something missing from their relationship, because they are not happy.
you are my best friend in the world.
it depends on age
find an inmate they're desperete to get married
i didnt know that until now!
do it once you're married
You're never going to feel like you can trust men
Women usually just don't talk about it
You wanna talk about it
When you cant get someone off your mind
don't go back because of him
look in her eyes and smile
it means exactly what she says it means.
really I don’t believe in horoscopes but I’m a Gemini
for some guys it’s only about sex
yeah my x said that before
he don’t really love you-he just wanted a make out session
you didn’t tell me whether your wife had children or not
seems like he isn't interested in you
there are better ppl for you out there
youll have more urges to be w other girls than if u were in luv
no way would i ever see him again
maybe find somewhere thats far enough from home but close enough that your family can visit like once a month
When you can hear each other without saying nething.
A chick knows what I want IRL, right?
If you love each other you will have sex.
Think about getting a job and sending him money.
I can't help thinking if it was me.
what if it don't work?
be yourself, be quaint, and wait!
not fair yo!
Could be love after 4 months
i've got a couple, you judge.
Do u have a ckn ass?
No comparison needed. Men are so goo at this!!
first comes the personality, then the fit body, then the kindness
u can like whoever u like!
Admit it, she's not into you
why nut just vex evry man??!?
Ok Yaar, all is well now.
I think the cat needs a new home.
You sound like a hottie so that is a great way to start.
First of all, find a guy you really dig.
What guy wouldn't want a virgin?
You should give it a ton of thought.
If he is around you'll never have any peace.
He was a mature man, not a little boy.
you clearly acted correctly.
it would be nice to chat with someone
my sig other lives far away
i am a big flirt
mmmm curvey men are where it's at
for valentines day send the ex a gift
when ur on te same hotness level its worth it
you are the only 10 here
only sex w/my dude and he had no1 else
tell him you dont want to marry him and he keep trying you then leave!!!
NO matter what your little girl comes first in all parts of your life.
There is somebody for everyone.
I made it and you can too.
Let your bff say it for you.
do any other females feel the same way?
if it is true love then he will wait for you without cheating on you.
do not take life seriosuly, you are young.
they have a hard face.
yes, leave quickly.
Be honest and the true love will find you anywhere :)
I can't stop thinking about sex. even more than all my buddies.
(sung super off key) stupid songs are quite something!
keep your head up and smiiiiile
they r max 5 yrs older than u
approach her and tell her that you are the man for whom she has been waiting all her life.
there are many more out there than what appear to be available at present.
They don't care if they laugh
in did, in my brain
dudes are different and everyone likes different girls
as long as you like him, it is fine.
Your retarded and you wouldn't date no one if you were my kid.
I'd help but I'm too lazy to read the qn
the rest is just looks
don't settle, you deserve more
I have this hottie and omg he is getting ensnared in my traps, dude will wanna move in I think.
my ex still has a big piece of my heart.
steer clear of that vegetation.
if she likes you, awesome.
If it's because you're like someone else then just tell me
How is discrimination wrong based off sexual orientation
Some people really like it but it creeps me out
If they love you they care how you feel
Until then, stop being an ass
she says it doesnt mean shit,and thats EVERY dudes dream
better be respectful about it too
sure ur not sending him the wrong message??
Yanno jus sumtime ya jus gotta get to stepp'n, grass greener no worky butt stay'n don neither, in-between place is when ya move your heart to "Let it go"
I haven't met a girl yet that thinks the same, y'all agree but the route taken is circuitous
Oh bae, did the mighty kingkong dingdong lose his tighty dingaling queenkong?
Yeah butt who you are deepens who you are!
Sooo...u think it be a worthy try eh?
I not sure...are you?
So who are you into? Guys? Girls? both? or none of the above :)
the sky's the limit baby! Go for it!!
I don't know what to say if she asks me
Why arent you working?
I think I freaking love him.
I asked him how he knew I was looking
Would he get mad if you ask other men for pictures
It couldn't have been that bad if they got married anyway
I'm trying to tell you that it was LONG!!
women are not easily sexually aroused, you need heop
you are probably too young and immature to get married if you have to ask.
i always argue with my mother's boyfriend.
i am a self-proclaimed sex-addict. I do not know if something is wrong with me, or if I simply enjoy sex.
their favorite position is your money in their hands.
A girl I know offered to let me stay at her place.
Tell them you already have a date and they should have asked you out sooner.
Stop daydreaming about what could be.
If you do impress her, she won't think about you the  same way.
When I think about it, I'm not sure why I did that.
i am not asking him on a date or anything similar.
it is too much risk if you are asking for my opinion.
if you are truly interested in the answer, just ask her.
what use is a nice appearance if he is rude?
ask him if he would like to go on a date with you.
It's our only problem, we get along fine except that.
Where did you get these numbers?
If you don't like them, don't date them. Simple
It probably makes him uncomfortable.
I am smart but not up to his level.
Have you ever liked a chic but not enough to be in a committed relationship with her?
that would be awful if you broke up after that.
you are completely new to me.
Run as fast as you can and don't ever turn around.
I heard people say that if you ask God for forgiveness for being gay you still get into heaven.
I care for him, but just as a friend.
LEARN HOW TO SPELL CAUSE  I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR ASKING
Don't do it, you know youre gonna regret it.
he won't tell you but he talks to someone else.
cause of that i started drinking and smoking, too.
if you agree with him, good, but how do you really feel about it?
get a thick one, just like you like it.
she's afraid all the time.
It's true some 50 year old men are attractive but you should look for someone younger.
Opposite of above me?
Guys don't really like to do that.
Why not just ask her out?
I dont care what they think, she's the ONE for me forever.
Aww hey, you know, PJ party?  I'll bring da pillows!
IS it all FUN AND GAMES? How can you HURT the people who should CARE ABOUT MOST?
I'm like that and my friend picks on me for it.
I have live this. Move on and youll get over it.
Most guys dream about the same thing
It's not a good idea to date so many people
I've got that problem too
karma will come around
Don't let him see you when you're down
We're happy and love life!
see him once and if he's cool keep him around
why r the sports w/contact so exicitng!?
OMG dont get another dog
should love the one you are having sex with
think its better to loose lover than be w/someone who dont care
think if ur asking u love ur wife!
If you want get a guy's interest, act sincere...ya know, be yerself.
My boobs are too big for this shirt to fit right.
check out my Q/A and you'll see that I cheated with my girlfriend's friend and them dropped her like a hot potato.
I don't think he knows I love him, he just looks at me like a friend. :(
Men give a high ranking to sex.....and why not, it feels mavalous!
It's right under Angelina's nose in the same house.
It's a black guy breaks in my house is it cool to say all black people are criminals?
Was I not pretty enough for him that night
Wear that sexy outfit he likes make his favorite dish and rock his world
Girls dig a guy who doesn't lie.
What he said, that shows what kind of person he is.
He never texted, he just rang, and she was like how do I answer this phone, and it was like weekly if he did contact her.
Girls love some lesbian action, but many deny it, espec as they get older.
not possible, cuz i'm not with a girrrl.
chicks... ever dig a dude you didn't know and hang wit him?
heckk yeah!!!!! If you want, give him 1.
Quickly accessable if you use it?
men care so much more about it then ladies.
just jazzed about the concept of experiencing love?
give em a toilet brush
Quit playing childish games, no reason for it.
That's not a normal thing for a dude.
I'd probably dump him if he pulled that.
I'm not a fan of fake boobs
You're caught in your web of lies
What don't you get? he just wanted to sleep with you
Don't waste your time giving him chances
Thanks I was just curious
If you two don't want to get together, no problem!!
Go wild .... get together in the wild!!!!
I think you'll see it happen; it's easy.
Or .... do you love that person known as me?
Umm ... you just answered your own ?
I don't think flirting is playing dumb.
You only live once so enjoy it.
I start with talking about what they're wearing.
He totally thought I was having fun.
Boys are definitely more sensitive but they aren't allowed to show it like girls are.
Dump her and move on with your life.
If you're meant to be together, love will make it happen.
You can't give him another shot at hurting you.
Of course you can but do you mean it?
Women want to make it challenging and not just have some easily controlled man.
Just watch his actions.
Once I break up with someone I won't date them again.
It's the Holy Grail of information.
Use condoms and be safe.
It's your choice, you only have to do what you want.
it isn't a negative item.
enjoy your life. Do not allow him to slow your progress.
forgive and forget as little as possible.
if a man does not care he would not care.
all men do it, even those who're married.
lately he avoids me, and will not talk to me.
divorce is not an action popular with children.
every day you should try to do one good deed.
begin searching for someone closer to your age with whom you have something in common.
No man has ever said I want to be friends with women.
Ya got it
It depends on you guys
You sound sorry good you should
It matters how thick it is as much as how long
i am in my mid twenties and still haven't had sex.
if its not improtant then why is she seeing another chick?
give him time to know your kids.
if they love each other, they will shack up.
yeah, you can, where were you during sex ed class?
You can't judge a book by it's cover, kiddo. Not everything is as it initially seems.
that feel when you need to hug him every time you see him.
That love song just makes you think about them.
do you think that he dosen't trust me?
don't worry about that, ok.
stuff changes when u get older
He'll move on and find someone else, but u lookin for something better, yeah?
stocks and bonds, just try investing in that stuff, you know
Seems your just clinging to a dream from what U said.  Dr.  Checko--it's a nickname
Toss it all out there and deal with the fallout
i believe unintelligent far exceeds foolish.
why does the color of someone's skin matter?
Tell her to hold on.
He still doesn't want to be more than friends.
Don't make it your circus and your monkeys.
Try to make him jealous by pretending your interested in his best friend.
Looks like they've become a better friend.
this is not something that should be accomplished through e-mail.
if I get broken up with over it, then I deserve it.
she will need to listen and find out what happens.
it is better to say 'Let's stop'.
Tell her to reconsider.
Nope, you girls are too scared
Inform him that it's your way, or you will not hear it.
When I first started dating Matt, I was in to John & did not know he felt the same.
same as why guys do it
dress right and nice guys will notice
if we do the deed she will figure it out eventually
That's just not smart at all....you r never gonna get it
Sure, you love him, but do you want to risk him bringing a disease home?
I need lots of answers so start talking.
Who cares what his rear end looks like if he treats you good.
They don't want to still be your friend?
they r a huge chunk of ur life
some dudes just dont want to be hitched just talk about it
lots of married dudes r happy
simply assure her that her parents lover her very much even though they no longer live together.
tell her you've been there, and he gave you a sexually transmitted infection.
you can start by saying hi, and having a casual conversation.
i inquired as to whether he continued to feel positively towards me and he responded negatively.
you need to do the things that you like doing.
in all likelihood the answer is 'no' because he does not really know her if they me online.
it is abnormal and not normal.
do not force it. You may make a mistake if you do.
if he doesn't like her, then it would be of her best interests to move on.
you will not receive a positive response.
You need someone there for you through it all good or bad.
You could wait to see if she sends you an email or just ask her in person.
Those flowers may be too strong.
The two of you should be getting it on all the time
I think you already know.
If you can just wait, youll get positive outcomes
Dont get hung up on the past, it's not a thing, if your girl love you.
All 3 together I'd say is cool, all good with me, but if not, I'd say no
It's typically the person who isn't best in bed.
Don't try too hard to impress, just let her know straight up that you dig her.
I got popped when I was 17, I don't understand what's a big deal is about losing virginity.
Do you have convos in Yahoo chat rooms?
You should tell him if you dig his buddy instead of him.
I don't dig skinny chics.
Why do men in relationships (married or not) cheat?
What is it that men want from women?
Why would someone risk everything for sex?
It's a shame how some people act.
Some girls think it strange if you wait too long.
are you having trouble with the one you got?
be direct ...are you gonna let me speak my peice, or what?
have a party with all you girlfriends, let her meet some new people.
you are 25 and he's 34, not a big difference.
men are simple so just remember 2 words - food and sex - and u will get your hubby's attention.
if you like brainy women don't bother looking at tall beautiful blondes.
to get a straight answer try asking a question
do u fall in love due to personality or hotness?
take my word for it, u will be sorry later in life.
Get over it and talk to him.
The #1 reason for divorce... Getting Married!!!
You know he's lying and you just let him.
You don't know how old he is?
Falling in love after 4 months is totally possible,it happened to me.
Say, "This isn't about you, it's about me."
I'm crushin on this chick at my learnin place.
Did you think about her when you were snoozin?
Get your bff and have a chat jam.
I am not a bro who talks with the other bros.
that's a good way to start your day off
I'd like to have a picnic lunch in a pretty, quiet, private setting.
Ask him where he works and how many hours he works.
you know we do that
i have been in this situation.
if in doubt, ask her permission.
i am searching for a woman who is a virgin, as I am one too.
Do not say more than you need to.
I guess a personality that isn't great but not terrible
When you get older, you will think differently.
they be addicted to estacy
I hope she don't die.
If you want to follow someone you can.
If you like the man say so and if not, say so.
The world has so may men.
Get someone else because you wouldn't have gotten hitched.
You will have to sign another with each other each day.
Hey man, come enjoy the party, my hot girlfriend is a great stripper.
Don't let the little things get you down.
But if it was just a dream, of course.
Being is love always leads to heartbreak.
It doesn't matter if I share their religion to go to the wedding
Its not worth the heartache find a guy that will treat you with respect
only one girl needs to like you.
did you think he wanted more because of the flirting?
if she doesn't give u her number, she doesn't want you
its just a girl actin older
dump his ass, he doesn't love you
that aint your business
Ya, I have my own ideas on that.
LOL is" Laughing  Out Loud"
So, should I have sex with my gal?
So, try flirting, see what happens. xoxoxo
don't allow a rival female to have an opportunity with the object of your affection.
just kidding he says, as he throws a banana at the screen and scratches head.
i would persue a intimate relationship with her even if she had just been intimate with him.
behave appropriately and heed your heart's desire!
ask her out on a casual date.
yeah can't get hitched in the slammer
gotta say hello!
um they are like you so don't be putting them down
I love my sister like crazy, but she keeps picking guys that are jerks.
Iraq is like a world away, but stay in touch anyway.
There are ways to get it done, chair, ladder, step stool, stilts...
It's simple, he just likes drifting from chick to chick.
You're the only one for me...always.
Peeps don't go there.
Anyone done it before they got hitched????
What's the prob with sex????
just go and surprise him already!!!!
yeah that story is like that tv show.
I feel their husbands aren’t good enough
anyway I don’t think it’s anything to worry about
love someone for who they are and not the color of their skin
I left and joined the REC team and I had a lot more fun.
the women with poor hygiene don’t think they stink and that’s the issue
we are not becoming younger, and that is the adventure of life.
i confront him when he looks at another woman, but he denies it.
youare correct but I nevertheless must do it or she will be angry.
just make sure that you do not get involved in their fights.
just in the event you two individuals are the closest of companions.
How should I act so I don't scare her off?
As long as yer 18+ is shouldn't matter.
Hook up with old friends and you'll prolly meet some new ones 2.
When a person is brainwashed, they ain't gonna understand your side of it.
Not really somethin that turns me on, KWIM?
I'm with you on that one, that's all I know.
uhhh, if you can't figure it out, I'm not telling you!!!
I'm a man, I'm always right.
Sex and Candy is my favorite song EVA!
maybe she feels the same way...
i'mma not of the opinion he doesn't find you trustworthy.
i am sorry to say but no, find employment.
you do not have to get married, as you could just become someone's partner.
do not do it if you are looking for advice.
Don't get used and be true to yourself.
Try to watch both straight and gay porn.
Anything's possible, like when a woman wed a dolphin.
Be yourself, honest, and confident...then it's all meant to be.
It boosts my ego when men hit on me.
behave yourself as I do not think your behavior now is appropriate.
it sounds like he has issues being faithful.
i do not let my girlfriend wait on me.
he loves me and would never be unfaithful towards me.
i frequently tell my man that I like him.
Would u like to sit in the driver's seat?
I like the cowgirl position with the lights on
She probably broke it off because you're an asshole.
OMG! He's talking to you!?
Most importantly, have a good time!
they don't play around with sex/NOT A GAME!!!!
who dont like sex i heart it
i need to talk with him, feel like crap if i dont
we all just cra cra
Awesome, I still gotta lot to go.
You’ll find someone better!!
Guys like some mistery in girls.
I’m so HAPPY she’s MY wife!!
but that's not bad, if your with a responible person and you like it.
marriage will come, when your ready.
just send him a little note.
never mind your age, just run !
tell him about the phone call.
i find that honesty is effective for me, and you should consider it.
he didn't take your feeling into account at all.
you will get over him, it is just hard right now.
i have been married three times and have two sons.
he is marrying a woman, correct?
politely ask why you haven't heard from her for some time.
the women you have been hanging around are not good for you.
If he's really hot what do you do about it?
Better 'fess up or she'll think you're hiding something.
Liar! If you're really in love your relationship will stay solid no matter what happens.
It doesn't matter where you are, you can always spread rumors about her.
It's on you if she does it again.
You're doing what's right. Just get a divorce and move on.
Then just ask her out
I cannot play with him for long because we have 3 small kids.
You shouldn't have them around babies they're diseased.
No one likes everything about their looks.
yr not really aksing anything tho
life's super, that the solution !
nothin' better to do, so i guess
where u live at
consider he dont even want to talk to you
having younger friends will help you feel younger.
Yes, surprise her with it, and then keep giving her little gifts during dinner!
They're friends but boyfriends too.
Tell him the kids need him.
You get what ya pay for in life.
But they still want sex with ya
don't sweat it, everyone's attracted to other ppl
my grandma is better at telling this story
yeah, men think about sex more than girls
just admit you were thinking about it
Check it out first and see where it goes from there.
You know that didn’t end well, right?
Well, what do you want to do now?
People don’t care about strangers these days.
No matter how you feel, go to the wedding anyway.

yeah love isnt found via the internets
Go ask her to be your date
You're smart and can do a lot of stuff
Girl go for it!
he's playing with his friend
are you sweaty?
If you're shy, just say it close to his eyes.
If he's such a jer, he's not worth your good loving.
You need to talk about it with him and ask him to quit.
Why would you ask something so stupid, common, and simple?
Your 3 year old kid already has a dad.
19, close to 20. Wbu?
A lady should be down for you and nothing else.
Go to Henderson, NC. There is a good amount of them here.
If your already fucking then its best just to keep having sex anyway
Were not able to read minds.
some peeps just need a push.
If that don't work I don't freakin know.
sorry to say but she was cheating on ya, man.
if she likes the beach think about a bahamas weekend
its a sure thing if you really love her

don't think you won't enjoy it lol
jon and i used to be best friends.
she may not be with you anymore and tell you that
Tell them you love em and move on.
Sorry, don't know where he is.
Dogs are like family, trust me.
What can i say to make her lose lbs?
They have lots of suggested items at that location.
Don't let anybody tell you different.
A man's booty is an important part of his body.
A simple way of saying he wants to hook up.
I could not hurt someone I care for.
I'm not sure, i may be mixed.
Some random guy sometimes asks why are all woman so slutty?
Don't run but make sure you tell him to slow down!
So what do I need to do for her?!
Yea I already said that earlier.
He doesn't care if he knows!
Take a cruise and push her off the ship.
It's up to you, the sitch is in your hands.
It's not great for the one holding the loot.
Possible, but I won't track him down.
My neighbor's messing with you.
I've never had sex with an unattractive man
please make her wear a bra because thats so gross not too
why not just call and ask?
Bisexual chicks are hot, I've date a lot of them.
Men like freedom, don't act like you own him.
I find Italian women hot.
I'll give you 100 points for that answer!
Don't give up if it doesn't work out, hold your head up and keep trying.
show him that you care by listening if he speaks about it.
people are rather unintelligent.
i only say this in a friendly way.
consider how problematic it would be for him to be in a relationship with a girl who is in junior high school.
were you wrong on that personal thing?
do not go out with a stranger. please be careful
when pigs fly
don't worry about it as long as you're fine with it
this isn't bad at all
if you're fine with it then whatever lol
if he's doing it on his own you should keep an eye on him
guys aren't afraid of the word love
they forced us apart, but i wont stop loving him
Follow your gut feelings even if it leads you down the wrong path.
I didn't enjoy sleeping with someone with small equipment.
What about the experience did you like so much?
Some clubs are best to have a good time.
Sometimes friends find out they were destined to be together when they date.
If you got boy questions, I got answers.
I really dig  dirty phone talk with my bf.
You gotta figure out how to know what people are all about, you feel me?
Go get something he'd wanna see you wearing.
you drew them in with your caring ways.
i'd like to be his friend, thats all.
i hope everything turns out alright for you.
men to not appreciate woman who proclaim what's necessary.
you do not have to feel bad or hurt if he tries to put you down, life is too short to let things worry you.
i am very much so, in my darling's eyes.
you already know a lot about each other.
i felt that way about a woman once. I am unable to explain why.
alternatively, simply pretend he is not present.
do not take him back if you are considering it.
you do not know what a threat you are.
Speak with your eyes, not your mouth.
I like a great kisser, but I LOVE GREAT SEX!
You're confused, and dont know what you want from life right now.
Depends on you. But do you want it to happen?
If he's gonna marry her, then she can't have been sleeping around a lot in her past.
It's gotta be something in the water!
What kind of buddy are you looking for?
Nope, he might want to talk to you before he falls asleep is all.
Probably it's the only thing that we value above good health in human terms.
You know they're just using you, right?
You'll own him when you have sex.
Sex is dirty and serious but making love is fun.
I get that way sometimes.
cuz some guys get tunnel vision when they're around beauties like me :P
women often talk about that when they get together.
maybe you just like bad boys?
you can probably do better
make sure you show your best side when she's around
i personally would want my daughter to be a homosexual. I comprehend how men are.
they are not worth your time and thoughts.
well, how do I tell him that I am now pregnant with his child, without him going ballistic?
begin with kissing then continue on to more advanced things.
well it just depends on the girl.. i'm a big liar and suckers believe me all the time
No need to worry about that embarrassment factor.
stick your nose into her privates.. I guess?!?
i know a girl who was married to a douche bag, who beats her kids.
you gotta find someone new if you're that upset
stick it out if he understands.
you may want to stay friends with him.
i do not know the person you met.
if your future husband cheated on you, how would you feel about that?
you're charming smiles doesn't cost a single cent.
someone will find you if not.
well, you can apologize, but, you will not get him back, you made your decision, so you have to live with it.
well, in this situation, I'm similar to your female friend, you're akin to my spouse!
they're in love, they believe they have hope.
i am not on the list.
hes your man, you know if hes all good or not
theres just no reason
Just cause hes big dont mean he aint a hottie!
Should I go back out or should I stay in??
Why is HE you’re boyfriend?!?
I’ve gained 2 pounds!!!
it could lead to love.
i try to find married men
and now I’m single at 28.
You get hitched cuz you wanna be with that dude forever!
there might be a tiny bit of her that don't wanna, but she probably really does.
That's excellent and we need to say thanx to him for the great sexy feelings!
It boils down to books about dream meanings, and if you believe that stuff or not.
let me guess, you'll relocate to New Zealand?
what will you be doing as I eat my chocolates and enjoy my roses?
when I saw that word for the first time, my friend told me what it meant.
this guy has not been in a relationship for a significant amount of time.
i'm unable to comprehend why I squandered a large portion of my lifetime in a relationship with a low-quality person such as yourself!
fine unless shes the boss
oh yeah for sure way out there people
cant wait to do the same to her1111
if someoneo ugly if they dont get asked out?
Marriage AINT NO JOKE
there is no point in being miserable because he does not accept you for you.
do a provocative dance for him.
iwould treat you with about the same degree of respect and consideration I do a store-bought dessert.
ubanyone lie about being 38?
you might loose them if you hide.
hey be patient.. it's been only 6 months
wanna have sex for more than 5 minutes?? Then don't have kids!
no way he cheated if he did it.
i'm pretty sure she still lives with her parents
why do u care??
Cant help what u dream & fantasy is fantasy, thats urs
watch out makes for more jealousy and stuff
no way would i post stuff like that
just BE YOU, can't please everyone, start w/u
You should follow your gut if you have doubts about him
like I'm gonna buy he doesn't have some reason not to like you?
now I wanna know too, what was that about?
you been through that before?
well if he likes you you'd better go with him
Get your friend to tell them guy you like him
It ain't done until it's done.
Uh no, u need to be smarter than that.
You're a better person now than before her.
Do just tell the man that you want to screw his sister.
Try being the WOMAN and you’ll probably find “the one”.
I’m almost 26 and I’ve been with my husband since I was 19.
get to know his personality by spending time together.
Actually, I like falling in love, until I am hit by the gravity of it.
I'm really busy right now so I can't reply.
They couldn't be apart from each other for very long
Why not give her a phone card, or send her a valentine in the mail?
Ask him where he thinks his life is going?
its all about the money
start to get to know her
I became drawn to someone whom until before now I wasn't into until they asked me out , thus just ask
I guess she dislikes me because of the flirting & all the talk between us
Don't want to cause problems!
Despite the fun that can be had it doesn't mean being a couple
All guys aint the same it justs depends on each guy.
You have to have a cents of humor.
REPEAT AFTER ME.. youre a crappy person!!
SHow everyone.
You gotta tell him you love him.
everybody wants to be loved
once you've moved on you won't care if he has
pains so much like pleasure that bleedings like coming!!!
the best way is to tell them.
may you be preserved with the help of God and your fellow soldiers.
then, you know what you have to do then, forgive them.
if you cheat once, you will most likely cheat again.
damn, you need tell that biatch "i hate you, back off".
I don't care about her PAST, I only care who she is now.
You have to understand that mom and dad are happy now that they have seperated.
Nah, your prettier at night because you're fathers sleeping, lmfao.
It's so sad, but you have to believe that it will happen when the time is right.
will u marry me?
Stay with both and see how it goes, trust me I’ve got experience v
if he wants to be friends, that’s fine.
You’re always sooo happy and glowing.
Marriage isn’t easy but it’s better.
The gay boys love to listen to that stuff!!
Check it out, kiss her and wait to see what happens next!
If she's not feeling you, you can forget it.
When you're in love you cannot be with other people.
Don't lose sight of you, it's not good to focus only on her.
What kind of restaurant does she like?
Now you get two of each of them.
I don't agree that it's the female's job to ask first.
perhaps you should both take s hot bath.
i suggest do not be serious about getting into a serious relationship.
perhaps it was an unwise thing for him to tell you, but in any event you should not worry about it.
If you really love him, you shouldn't want anything else.
If my hubby ever cheated, I'd probably cut off his penis and hang it from the mirror of my Mustang.
Love can be weird for guys.
Don't compromise your faith for anyone.
There is so many exciting things to live for.
Maybe open it and then ask her.
Tell him you love him no matter what.
Try to make her think you like her in a different way.
My man is always looking at other chicks when he's driving but he tries not to be notices.
You should treat him if you haven't seen a friend in forever.
Would you sleep with multiple people?
That dude is messing with you.
Once I thought about it, I realized I want them both/
Conjure me up in a dream and then float into my life.
What turns you on in a woman? Her voice, her looks? The way she treats other peopel?
ilike him, and he likes me too.
i adored this man, however, subsequent to my humiliation by him in front of a 40-person crowd, I'm unsure of my emotions!
you need to break up with him. Then he might realize he had someone good.
only if it feels kul to you.
have I told you recently that I like you?
I don't know how to let him go.
I want a friend to talk to.
We've been through a lot.
It's fine if you don't mind being her fallback.
Take a condom with you.
get a man for yoself
is this to far?
if you are naked and in bed with someone, you are gonna fuck
you will no, if you are into him.
stop trying to run her life.
my guy says it lets him tell me how great i look.
think about how that makes you look to his buddies.
it don't matter what she does for a living, she can tbe a stripper for all i care.
i feel that they should get married at this time.
the one you think is your boyfriend is not a real boyfriend.
i love only worrying about myself.
is there something wrong?
ooh, also were men aware of your comment, you'd be severely unpopular, for your edification.
Provide him with all the necessary info.
(Use caution if he's a non-comprehending caveman)
Yup, sharp sense of humor, great disposition and self-esteem!
I feel bad for guy number 7 if she's thinking about guy number 8.
He's so adorable, but listen to me, I find myself wondering about his thought process now and then. Ha ha.
You can pick me, but be clear on types or stereo because age is also a factor!
Why is she wanting to be nosy?
I don’t enjoi hurting people.
she deserves credit for sticking with it even when she finds it upsetting.
my boyfriend, who I have been dating for just over a year, has lied to me continuously throughout our entire relationship.
did he do it on purpose?
you can trust us, because you would know if we lie.
ask her about her feelings and why she is with u
its bc they like to make u feel bad
anwser men are not understandable
love my baby daddy aka my bf!
think u already made up ur mind about sleeping w/him
can't they show us some respect??
that, for sure really pissed me off!
umm r u supposed to sign that??
thinking that god doesn't care about sexual procliviites?? What a narrow mind!
a nice wedding in the yard was good enough for me.
although, I am glad that I had married him, people are freaking out about that.
just in the event your heart is desirous of it; if your instinct is to flee, proceed to behave thusly.
someone who is unfaithful once will be unfaithful again.
you should wait until you hear what she has to say.
He prolly thinks you got knocked up on purpose.
no offense to the good guys.
i love her!!!!
I don’t know about that.
Don’t try to get her to be a stripper!!!
My bffl had a date with a tiny guy, and they actually kissed!
If "sure" is his answer, he ain't screwing around on you.
She loves you like she'd love her brother.
If I did, then how come I'm going through his things?
he is not lonely.
no, that means that you are the girl of my dreams.
terminate your relationship with him.
i hear a coat vacuum will take care of it.
break up with him and do not listen to his excuses because he does not love you.
You're only noticing what she looks like.
If you don't reach out now, you'll never be in contact.
If you're good all the time, it's nice to step it up sometimes.
We also have hormones, for your information.
No unless you're not sure.
I love you so much baby!
I think you can find something better to do in life than trying to figure out men.
I think you should just chill out for a bit.
Sometimes I like to go across the country to my hometown, just to get away for a bit.
Try having sex right before you go to sleep
Say yes if you're down for him, say no if you're not.
I would choose Black dudes because white men aren't as hott.
it really depends. . . does he like war games, sports, etc.
I don't want him to be my boyfriend anymore.
I really think that they are loved because they wouldn't find it if they weren't
i got to play a lot more with the laid back caoch.
everyone has there own way of thinkin’.
It will help your love life too.
Keep going till you get to level 4!!
I’ll be able to help since I’m fluent in idiot, gruntinese and jabberwocky!
You can figure this out if you go to the UK yourself.
Most women on campus can't stand him.
Guys love staring at our breasts.
Dump the girlfriend and she'll be shocked!
Speak up and say something in your defense.
get her a gift then ask her
dont even know if u r a dude or a chick how can i anwser?
no worries love comes all the time
she really needs to get on it before she gets preggos
Kick his ass out if he's screwing around on you.
Start from the day you got married.
I have a ton of friends, both guys and chicks.
The future is not looking good.
Talk it out if your worried aobut it.
I hate wearin flats, i aint gunna wear em for a guy.
if he loves you it's gunna kill him, but he'll be fine eventually.
why did ya marry a quiet guy when you wanted someone to talk to.
it's online e'rwhere.
don't do the deed if you have't yet
what kinda dad does THAT make him?!
you need to be around a man that's rough around the collar for a while
problem is I can't tell if she likes me the same
I only like emotionally strong people though
the meaning is she is fond of you in a brotherly fashion.
that is only effective in bad teenager movies.
there was not enough feelings there for her that he would leave his wife.
stay with your sister if need be.
i haven't gone wrong yet going out with a friend
do you really think he's just playing with my feelings?
i can't stand being around those potty mouths
i have a problem saying no to a friend without causing problems
There are snugglers and non-snugglers in this world.
Yeah, she was invited, she came over to my room, and the door was closed.
Romantic love is so much fun.
You seen The Game?
Wait to say I love you
I'd rather die than work anymore.
Don't think about all the stupid times, think about the good stuff
Saw them last they and they were alright.
She's not in college? Do you want to go to jail?
Shoot him an email if you're stuck.
the more you think about her, the more you will want her.
sometimes sex is all i have on my mind.
go for it, do it loud and proud, then she will know how much you care.
that'll really make it worse!
maybe you werne't as in love as you thought you were when you got hitched.
when someone hurts you, then you will have someone else to fall back on.
tell her to try to ask him to go out with her or something.
i believe he is seeing a non-respectable woman.
if she will not remain faithful to you, she is not worth it.
if you like him, you should go on a date with him.
She can't stop you from seeing your child.
A man's man would never bribe you to kill your child.
Stop contacting him and see if he misses you
Correct your daughter for her foolishness.
It may be the same way you said it to us.
And I didn't have kids who depend on me I would die for my one true love.
Why are so many men into Asian girls.
Look I need help figuring out what I need to do.
Cheat on her with her best friend and treat her like a queen
Tell her to stop making bad choices with these Bad Boys.
a lot of my friends' girlfriends have asked me a similar question.
i am trying to solve that problem myself.
try to kiss him to see if you have any feelings for him?
my boyfriend truly enjoys my toes.
do it when u see him again or when before he goes
my adivce i a man take it slow there
can u hear yourself right now???
basically lead him by saying what you want.
he can not get a girl to share.
you become disinterested easily when you are with him or her.
you know what you have to do.
Even a daisy can answer "he loves me, he loves me not."
One day we were sitting on a bench and the park and I just told him how I felt
She was wondering if she hurt my feelings or something...she's always questioning me.
The answer would depend on how short or long of a time you've been together.
Knowing stuff ahead of time can cause us to change our behavior.
You are in deep shit.
When she gets free, she will if she wants to.
That's not gonna be a problem.
There's so many gowns and bridesmaid dresses, it could take moths to decide on your own!
The changes started later that month.
It's not fine and being a guy doesn't make it ok.
Jamookae has mental issues but I'd still choose him.
i was wondering about how to kiss her the next time.
i am just stating my opinion!
i am not one of them.
whaaaat? why kill a baby
she doesnt like u like that
be cool and let her know how u feel
might come to ya otherwise its just not 2b
Do step two if nothing changes after three weeks.
He doesn't like the outfits you pick for him most of them time.
What should I do? He messed up but I still love him.
Check it, Just because you have a man, does not mean a dude won't try to hollar.
Roses are red, but violets are blue
Do what you gotta, you are the right one here
Wifee isn't pushing for sex like she used to
I do care, but that's not a big deal
think nothing of it, he will understand.
you elope with the person you can't stand to live without.
yes, you should move on and attempt to find a new relationship. There are plenty of single people out there.
you basically have to overdose in order to feel anything.
If you don't like dildos, then it won't work for you.
Sorry, it will always be weird.
How do I get it outta there?
How can I help her if I don't know who she is?
My mother taught me to be an honorable man so say what you will, but I do my best to be honest and faithful.
I've never been a teach but I sure appreciate the job they do.
Lots of guys like girls in glasses, just ask me, I've had plenty of boyfriends.
i just need to meet the woman of my dreams then it'll be all good
It was after I caught him cheatin on me
Dont go after married men, it makes you look triflin'
i like to dream about other guys, I don't see a problem with it
tell him when you are in private at the right moment.
thirty is relatively young to be getting heavier.
stand ua ground, and let him know it is over.
your age is too low and an excess of negative events can result.
he is done with you because he got what he wanted.
Try pet stores and maybe barns!!
If you’ve found someone else let him do the same.
I’d be with you if I knew THAT!
We barely know each other, I can’t love you.
You waited TOO LONG and missed you’re chance.
She is probably distracted by other things and doesnt know when someone is into her.
It doesn't make sense if you're attacted to her but you aren't a lesbian.
We can discuss this later
Don't tell him, show him what you really like.
If you aren't married, other guys would be interested in you.
