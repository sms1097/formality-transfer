I prefer to let the guy ask me.
I suffer through verbal abuse from my wife.
You will have more friends than you want.
It's nice that you get to see pictures of who you are talking to.
I need to know what to do.
Love me, love me. Oh dear God love me!
It would not be a word. It would be a singing opera.
I like my life with the exception of her yelling and using swear words.
I know how it is.
Does he have a favorite sports team?
While you are away, he will do it again and again.
I suggest saying "Look, this is not working out for me anymore".
No sister, I do not think so.
Then kiss her, brother; that works every time.
Women mature faster than men and some men never mature.
After that I never bought her another gift.
You can attend you class with her if you would like.
It will happen when you choose to be wealthy and powerful.
Please don't beg for love, money or respect.
You will definitely know when you are in love.
Do not base your relationship on money or material items.
What if someone asked this question: "How can I get my boyfriend to notice me?"
I am unable to sign in at the chat room.
If you just live with a friend, I call that friend with rights.
It is hard to tell from this question, but it seems like you are trying to change yourself, and that is a bad idea.
I don't know what he is thinking, sometimes we just sit and watch.
Go France and see for yourself.
She was aware I was previously dating someone that was married.
You should not let what other people say bother you.
I wish you good fortune no matter what course you take.
The caveat is that you and I are not married, and this is acceptable to me.
I recommend that high school students do not date anyone who is still in middle school.
If this tactic is not successful with one person, then just keep trying with others.
You may want to inform this man that if he makes one more phone call to you, it will result in the loss of his job.
After that, a gentleman got involved who changed everything!
I am willing to do so, as long as the four of you are as well!
Contrary to what other say, they are not born that way.
I think you should try a different kind of female.
She and tend to cross paths every now and then.
You should say yes, if you love him.
It would be wise to separate from him as soon as possible.
I have learned to love myself which is something I was unable to do in the past.
I have trouble meeting girls because I attend a school with only boys.
Please talk and do not rush your words
You should go and play with your dolls
do you talk to that person often?
With no level of committment, is that concidered double dating?
It is not the size of the breast that is attractive, but how well one carries herself.
You simply have to do that which makes her happy.
Yes, though I suppose it depends on the vows.
Perhaps you should be asking where the sexually transmitted diseases are in Kay's.
That means you do not have to antagonize her any longer.
In that case, ask her to accompany you to the next school dance or to see a movie.
Is something happening with your friend, or with hers?
But, do not mistake my meaning, do not give way and become submissive. Find a compromise.
It may not succeed if you are truly cowardly, and therefore become more fearful than the woman is.
I believe that wound depend on whether her and her husband have an open marriage.
She wishes to enjoy herself, and that is why she has entered into an affair with you. Do not take this relationship too seriously.
Just say that for the moment you just want to be friends.
That is because they are just not doing their job!
It would be good to get out of there now while it is possible.
Yes, that is true if they are addicted sexually to it, but that would mean they need to see a sex therapist.
Personally, I think young men are sexy, as long as they are more than 25 years old.
It is because boys are not mature enough yet to know what they want or what they have.
Five feet tall and 135 pounds sounds very good to me.
Please seek mental help from a professional.
If that is true I would not be surprised if he is unfaithful again.
If he went after another womant he obviously did not care, it is not all her fault.
If she has yet to bring it up, then it does not need to be talked about.
Perhaps you could check there first.
If you are desiring one of your own, you should try Yahoo Personals. Don't you agree?
First, you need to be nice and wait on them.
Go on. Talk to him and do not hide anything.
The same qualities you look for in a gentleman.
Young women who ask young men out are ten times more successful than girls who do not.
So the simple man fell in love one time with his wife and claims it was real love.
Do not retaliate, you should not devalue yourself to her level.
Cafes, coffeehouses, malls are all places you could find a girl, depending on what type you are are interested in.
If he loves you, he'll appreciate whatever you give him.
Since I'm a prude, I'll say marriage.
I, for one, am nothing like that.
You should love them the way they are.
I married too many times for love before. Now it depends upon how much money we are speaking about!
Nicely done, I know she'll definitely love it.
His father, meanwhile, is obsessing over his new love interest.
Firstly, that's not a friend.
I hope you'll answer me.
My friends agree with me as well.
I say love who you love, race shouldn't be an issue.
You shouldn't go any further with this man, please?
Utilize terminology that reminds him of better times in the past.
Do you have any idea where I should go meet them?
If you really like her, go as a group at first.
"Closer" performed by Nine Inch Nails is the most sexually relevant song ever to exist.
They are committing the very actions they accuse you of.
Besides the previously mentioned advice, merely act as you normally would.
Be amusing and slightly arrogant.
Merely inform him of your feelings of not liking him in the manner he desires and tell him not to revisit the subject.
See it like that and forget about him or her.
Women want a man who will never cheat on them.
Something to look at or play with.
My dress was long wit ha fifteen foot train!
You will be happy when you communicate and be yourself.
You still got the wrong answer, even though you thought that you had the right answer.
Last time i was injured, so it's just me this time.
Call him and talk with him about the matter.
Most likely, you'll never find a significant other that likes you for your personality, or even if you like him.
Just explain to them that you love them very much.
It would have to be someone that I'm familiar with.
Do you even know her? She doesn't feel the same way about you. You should talk with her.
Now, do not let the other person read it.
Obviously, you should make sure that the best friend wouldn't have a problem with it.
I heard that it doesn't really matter. What does matter, however, is how you use it.
You should date for someone you find is attractive as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
It is not as bad as everyone makes it sound.
You will like each other better if you sleep together.
Also, you probably should not have a girlfriend.
Both, I am just guessing that it matters because of the levels of comfort and perhaps psychological reasons for men.
Maybe you can relive that, then make it even better.
Being in love never hurts, but losing love does.
My best friend had many reasons why she didn't approve of my boyfriend.
If I were in your shoes I would buy him something he enjoys, like a sweatshirt or something of the sort.
Get together with your friends and have a great time!
Yes, the reason why you proposed is because she would be worth the new thought.
If you need help ask just ask him for it. I think he would rather help than get yelled at and stuff.
The best way to handle something like this is to just say it.
We need someone who can take care of us in the long run. Men are big babies.
Girls like it when you compliment their breasts.
Guys just do not notice that girls have bowel movements.
I do not like the thought of something that untraditional, but, of course, it is okay.
I can only speak for myself, a fun-loving guy.
Think about what it is you want from a wife.
Maybe you should try it.
You can find people online or where you live.
Get it out in the open!
There are a lot of chat rooms for Seattle on craigslist.com.
She might be more shy than you know because that is nonthreatening.
I love Jesse, too, even though he is dating Katie Cassidy.
You can buy a nice blanket to keep you warm.
A good friend will be a good listener who will not hurt your feelings.
If he is a great person, his skin color should not matter.
On the other hand, it is possible to find a new best friend- there is an abundance out there.
I am unaware if it is possible.
There is no difference between ages if the intellect is similar.
Please come and assist me girls.
I do hope you enjoy my ideas!
Message me and if you have any trouble contacting me, try the number five.
If you are attracted to him, I think the best plan of action is to ask him out on a date and attempt to spend some more time with him.
Ultimately, it is important to trust yourself and plan your actions accordingly.
You might want to go over to her house and explain that you have more things to discuss with her.
Husbands can be just as quick to erection as men much younger than them.
God has all power, why not love him?
The age is not an issue, we are from different races.
Actions speak louder than words.
I have to follow my instinct.
You give me reason and power. Will you love me?
In addition to skin color difference, we have an age issue.
There is more to love than just saying "I love you".
What do you do if you are in love with a girl on the internet?
That is my personal opinion.
If she is happy, you shouldn't let your jealousy get in the way.
I always get stuck with someone who resembles a lumberjack!
They do it because they love each other.
It's too bad you aren't aware of how he ended his relationship with his daughter's mother.
You can meet another girl since there are so many available!
Do you believe I should believe this individual, or leave him?
For what reason would you purchase the cow if the milk itself is free?
Given the game is serious, however, do not get pregnant.
Nonetheless, you are a kind individual to be around.
Whether it is the first time or the hundredth time, please use protection.
As I have said before, finding that special person just happens; you cannot plan it.
If there is one think girls like, it is a man who smells nice.
Look at my question - I posted that I need help as well.
Mature men could not care less whether or not their girlfriend is a virgin.
It could be a trust thing as my mother is like that when my step dad goes away.
He has a family so allow him to reconcile with his lady.
All is well, God already has the right person for you.
I am undecided.
Some guys do not care about females.
He has a baby. Let him work things out with his girlfriend.
Your situation is fine. You are waiting for the right person or you tend not to trust people.
First, please explain how it is possible that he had no choice.
I am somewhat stuck in the middle.
The reason is that a man will lie, cheat, and steal to get you into bed.
That is if you still care about me.
I really enjoy Gotham City.
I question whether or not I should just cut girls out of my life.
You are not in love with me, you just needed a friend at the time.
If she tells you that you should know that she does then disregard her statement.
He had an extroverted personality, while I have an introverted personality.

You are in the right place at this moment.
I love derrieres, so please dance to your heart's content!
He is outgoing and I am quiet.
You still have a chance to get right with God as long as you have breath.
If it is God's will for you then He will bring you your soul mate.
Your present position is good.
I know that I'm crazy, but I have to leave you.
I'm assuming that you are referring to "American."
It may be that he/she just wants something.
A tear came out of his eye when he said that.
I guess that women are creative, however, I think that men are even more creative.
Ask him about that.
Simply ask him if he likes you
She doesn't prefer the "usual guys" and we can't keep her locked up in the house.
You will not be hurt in that amount of time.
Keep you eyes open, but love him anyway.
What is a heady coctail that girls find irresistible?
I love your questions, please give me more to answer.
Does she feel the same way?
That is when your underwear will get sucked up by your butt crack.
Just because they might say it back doesn't mean anything. They're only words.
I'm not sure that I want to date anybody else. Should I just be patient?
Is there signs? you should ask him. It's the best way.
I don't believe in chat lines. Just be yourself.
Listen to track 10 on the "XXX" soundtrack.
Why can't he just hear me out?
If you fail, then ask until you succeed.
He needs to love it and want to work on it.
Are you looking for bad or nice girls?
Because the destiny of human has been to ask until death!
Counseling could be a sensible option.
He would really like it if you kissed him.
You don't look your best.
She is probably taking advantage of you--end the relationship.
You will make someone happy, if only for a short while.
You would not like it at all and would probably be upset over it.
Tell her if you find something nice or pretty or if something upsets you.
Are you hesitant to talk to them.
You always want what you can not have
I am still in love with him.
Loosen her up and see what happens.
I made strange looks at the girls that I like in order to throw them off.
Balance and getting the rent paid are sexy.
It began in the days of the cavemen.
That is a stupid inquiry, what possible reason would Jesse have for desiring to date you?
Will a wink and small amount of flirting be of assistance?
Cut ever connection completely so it becomes out of both view and thought.
I met my husband through online channels and, to my knowledge, he is not a serial killer.
Spend time with her.
I am telling you it is true.
Cherish and love them forever.
I met my boyfriend, Ted Carter, and now i know what it means to be happy.
I hate to say this but I do not believe she will be faithful to you.
I do not understand why the house was in such disarray.
If a girl is not that into you, she will not even think about letting you kiss her goodbye.
This could take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple months to happen.
When your partner starts to complain that you are constantly worried about spending to much money, you know you have a problem.
It did take time to get over it. Going to the strip club helped me with that.
Certainly, but women don't make it out as a big issue like men do.
That would be either a marriage proposal, or a ring.
I hope things work out for you, best of luck!
I am curious what type of man women find irresistably attractive.
Stop criticizing your mother so much and allow her to have fun.
He is unable to choose the women he would like to have a relationship with, compared to well-endowed men.
Maybe she is not ready to make such a large commitment as marriage.
You should associate with girls similar to your own age.
You should ask her how her day is going.
Just continue searching and it will happen.
I do not understand why there is such a commotion.
Self-love is more important than money and does not cost anything.
You do not know the meaning of "full-figured woman"?
The intercourse may not be good, you can ask them.
This sounds like domestic violence to me.
I was wondering what you thought about it.
Thank you, but i do not want to hurt their feelings.
The Christmas card says Merry Christmas.
He needs to gain your trust and respect.
My final choice would be something like full length, thick, long pajamas.
People grow up at different ages, and some never do.
Don't just get a simple chick.
No problem if he is interested in you too!
Call her later on during the day and then kiss her.
Do you understand? Do not call me again!
Who is going to arrest you for asking a man on a date?
Do not talk about your work or anything that could be considered boring.
You become depressed sometimes and feel as though you cannot do anything. Let it go.
You should take her to a nice dinner or something of that nature.
You understand what I am saying. Observe, Learn, and Apply.
Is it goodbye when it does not feel worth it anymore?
Could it be that you are looking for someone to make it happen for you?
I do not know, however, in my opinion, you sound both desperate and as though you require physical intimacy.
I was not sure if I was.
Yes, there is an end, but you have to go through a couple of bad ones first.
You never listen to them at all.
You have a once in a lifetime chance, so you should enjoy it.
The best of luck to you as you look for love, if you have not found love already.
You should spend more time with girls.
If things don't work out between you two, come to an understanding.
Don't worry about anything, his sister is going too.
Please don't make it a cage.
It's like if a man were walking a toy poodle instead of a large dog.
I would say no, if he is really trying to find one.
The right person for you won't reject you, so just keep looking for that person.
And never make her feel guilty over whatever her answer is.
When you are talking to her, be genuinely interested in what she is talking about.
There is no reason to get angry, because it will not solve anything.
It's like Russian Roulette, in the end you always lose!
If so, don't damn her for the same thing that you would do.
What is he so angry about?
Do priests also perform inappropriate activities with altarboys?
The point being is don't get too much that you spoil your life.
If he does feel the same way about you, he will not ignore you. He will not ruin the friendship.
I like to hang out with friends every chance I get.
What are physical disabilities, like someone who uses a wheelcahir?
What is the rule for that?
You will have to read my other questions and then you will know how to answer this, ok?
Was he able to find a girl in time?
That would not be true. People are human, so they make mistakes all the time. It does not matter whether they are in love.
And of course, then doing the housework.
It would be perfectly fine, as long as you love children and you love him.
It could be that he's just not ready to say the words "I love you" yet.
So what if he isn't understanding of it, if he does that?
We guys do not care for lesbians at all.
Well I will share my story of my ex-husband.
If he is not smiling already just by gazing at you!
Wear short outfits only for him.
It is perfectly all right because many girls have asked me out.
If you cannot spend time with her and communicate there is no reason to pursue.
Most of the time it does not mean anything.
Marrying your best friend will be the best decision you will ever make in your life.
If you are then you like marrying both men and women.
Unfortunately, women tend to not think rationally sometimes. It's a shame for the men in their lives, but unavoidable.
I feel that you may be acting too persistant about it.
It does not bother me.
Without trying, you may have regrets later of what opportunities you may have missed.
Have you ever had sexual relations in a vehicle?
I support the ability for anyone to get married.
No, I do not mean dropping hints.
Older men are very nice, also.
He also started to smoke, which I do not like. That is not the sweet, loving guy I met years ago.
You should make sure he uses protection.
You should prevent him, by blocking all the pornographic websites.
Most likely you're not the only one who utilizes it.
You're a very funny woman.
Primarily, I will marry for love. If both things appear, I'll happily take them.
Men grovel for sex, woman love that.
And not only car doors but every door. It's everywhere we go!
I have seen this in a movie.
Everyone Fights. But you do no want to waste your life on one girl if you do no love her.
There is no excuse not to have a job, sir.
Who would want someone who treats them like trash.
Because some want to have children and some don't.
But love is the ability to feel it, and know you are in love with someone.
Try this website, it a fantastic search engine and might be useful.
My wife has huge breats.
Hello, I am from Iran and I want to get married to a great man who love me.
Do not flirt, do not talk, and do not dance with that person.
Let her be if she will not listen.
It has worked out really well so far.
Woman give lots of explanation for everything and they repeat it 10,000 times.
That is just too unreasonable.
Those types of people are not fun to be around!
I am not going to let one night of intercourse ruin my home and family.
Please list something that you would like for a belated Christmas gift.
Your husband gave you a ring.
Just be direct and ask her to be your girlfriend.
Only if you wish to, but deep in your mind you can't forget.
To be sure, if your mother found out, she would be quite upset.
There are many suspicious stalker types out there.
You can look her up in the house. It's your right as a parent.
Ethan Hawke. Beauty is not his best quality, but he is quite attractive and appealing.
Your best friend would be happy to help you.
American's are larger in size than other countries.
Congratulations, and don't give up!
Be careful in case something goes wrong.
I'm sorry, but I don't think she likes you.
When they say something dirty, it sounds very naughty.
Maybe an angel is not for you.
Do not listen to the young one.
What do guys enjoy during sex?
It depends on what you like?
Love is not a thing to be ashamed of.
Okay, so I really this guy at school alot since 3 years ago.
But don't give her or her family any reason to not like you.
Rouse Christina, you don't know what I mean by saying that?
First the forehead, down to my cheeks, then the lips.
Do not use pick up lines to start talking to them.
I have wanted to do something like this as well.
Did you masturbate in front of one another?
If you really love him, give him one more chance to change.
I do not even remember how our friendship started.
No, because that is the beginning of what is about to come.
I am a 20 year old liberal high school graduate.
It is because you know that he is having fun and that you are not.
They are just plain ignorant!
I would suggest that you take it easy if you think that he or she still loves you.
It is okay; he is probably with his family.
As I said before - if you trust him, I would not worry.
They do not even bother to talk to you.
I will love you forever, XBOX 360.
They feel as if they want to have those kinds of things.
Romance is definitely great: candles, rose petals, etc.
Why not watch the comet, doesn't occur that happen.
She's not content, because I work too hard.
To purchase the correct gift, think of her favorite thing, place, and person.
They're little love cards with sticky notes.
My daughter is 10. She thinks it is disgusting. She does not like the idea at all.
My choices would be: music by Usher, "Wine" by R Kelly, and anything that is soft R&B and has a good beat.
The most important thing is love, because love causes romance to grow.
Stop it before you try to start something serious.
Clearly my friend, being rejected would be the worst thing that could happen.
Such as a cd from a band that he likes.
They have not yet figured out that girls are people and not toys.
He says he has to cheat?
She probably thinks that you are weak now.
I really like him, but we are very good friends and I do not want to ruin that.
And listen, to see what she says.
There is no  debate for me, love all the way.
Tell her all the things you love about her, no matter where you are or what your doing.
If that doesn't work refer to line number 1.
They make vibrators, it's time you join in the fun!
Are you looking for a trophy boyfriend?
If you want to get together and are interested in her, then go for it.
There is always a secluded place to be found.
If you do not feel safe, then you probably are not.
I hope it works out for you!
It's very romantic, she'll enjoy it.
Act as if you feel comfortable with him.
You should talk about it with ythem, or your boss. Definitely not me!
Sit down on the couch, and watch it with him.
I'm stressing out so bad.
I am afraid of Zen Monkey wisdom while worshiping it at the same time.
No, of course I would never do that so soon after their relationship ended.
But he made a mistake and lied to me many times.
Simply hug her, tell her you love her, and take her for a walk.
"I can do more repeatedly. I am the master of coitus." That is what I will say.
I am one of them; what do you want?

Can you call a person a friend?
If we do not get affection, we feel unwanted and unloved by the man we crave it from.
Is your inner heart telling you that it is right?
Ladies love confidence, and the puppy dog eyes might also catch their attention!
A lot of people forget it is not about me.
Ladies please answer with a score value of one being no and ten being yes.
I think that drove her crazy because she could not tell how I felt about her.
The better question today would be where should you get it from?
Did you have virtual sex with him?
Tell her because if you choose not to then you will always regret it and wonder about what happened if you had.
I mean yes when I say yes and no when I say no.
Since he begged me to stay and said he would do anything to keep me.
So what if you live with your parents?!
When you are with him, do you ask him how he feels? And if so, does he tell you?
I dislike men who are awkward when they ask for a date.
If you would like to speak with me about this.
Tell him you do not wish to speak to him or have any other contact with him from this time forward.
If looks are what you're interested in, you're going to have to look your best at all times.
If you do, you could become wealthy.

I do not believe that being "thick" means that one is fat.
It is my sense that you do not want a romantic relationship, but only to have a man involved in your life.
What should I do to gain her confidence again?
Many younger men spend a good deal of time deciding whether they wish to have children at all.
In addition, we are on a fairly restrictive budget!
Because he is rude, and incidentally it seems that he should not be around you or your infant.
I really hope that isn't a serious question.

Mostly woman are attracted to sensitive men, but not all.

Women are not control freaks. They just want to have things done the way they want.
It is not gay if you like to have a girl to have sex with your butt.
I am very attracted to the look and accent of foreigners.

You can be nice but devilish in the bedroom with her, at the same time.

When their relationship begins to have problems, you should let him know that you are interested and would be grateful for a chance with him.
If you are, you might want to ask if they would mind.
No, I do not believe so - I still think love is great, but then I look at domestic violence situations.
Without love, there cannot be romance.
Have you never looked at pornography?
Try not to argue with him.
I know him. Call out to him.
Should I forgive him?
I am the first one to admit when I need help.
I do not have the space to type all the reasons.
Sometimes, it is hard just to ask.
Is this some sort of 'new age hocus pocus'?
I'm not sure. Soon, you'll start talking to each other.

Find that particular man, my dear, and you'll have a keeper.
Excuse the photograph, I just thought that it would be funny.
There are quite a few women that I find interest in, however, I don't think they're interested in me.
It's difficult to do this without knowing your wife, but that's just my general advice.
She may have had another guy there and couldn't answer.
Yes, if you really love her.
I know I love her more that this guy.
Has she been through a bad breakup?
Congratulations, that is a wonderful gift.
I'd like to enjoy an appetizer somewhere, get drinks elsewhere, have a fun 6-course dinner, and enjoy dessert at home.
There is too much drama with this person.
Just pretend to be hetersexual. That may turn her off and it would all go back to normal.
When you get married - two becomes one!
Get over it! Go outside and find a real one.

It is how the world works.
How do I keep my new boyfriend happy?

Sorry, but you have to do what your Mother or Father tells you to do.
I believe you just have to wait for him to provide more.

Do I feel different than the others?
Don't bother. Let him catch us together.

A person who is honest and creative.

I have the same issue with my mother at the moment, but we are trying to reach a resolution.
Marriage is a lifelong decision, my friend!
Yes, it does for a guy like me with a thick, 10-inch penis!
Trouble related to love and relationships.
Introducing the bride and the groom, cutting the cake, eating dinner, dancing, etc.
I have the same problem with my mom right now, but we are getting there.
Marriage is for life, my friend!
Yes it does, if it is a guy like me with a thick, ten inch penis.
If you think like that, you should definitely stay offline.
I never have a boyfriend, I fall in love quickly, and frighten them away.
I don't want to end up losing the only best friend I ever had!
The purpose is to let their emotions out, while you listen.
That's definitely because love is blind.
Let me assure you that this is not a joke.
A small number of tatoos are acceptable and certain piercings are very attractive.
I prefer that he never buy me flowers.
I suggest you stop attempting to line up a date online and refrain from using the computer.
Take out the trash, pick up your underwear, and state I love you at least twice per day.

It's to stop anybody from getting injured.
A girlfriend with a nice body and a great personality.
Try to get his schedule to find out if you like him.
Touching each other is very close to breaking the rules.
It is likely that he will go back.
Try not to be too harsh when you are reprimanding him.
Someone who is both smart and funny.
It is just going to make them angry.
You cannot get a guy to like you, and there is no need to.
Simply do not spend time with them.
If you slept with her mother or sister, you are not going to get her back.
I cannot speak for all women, but I am sure I do.

Your boyfriend will not let you have one.
He should think you are the sexy one.
Try to do things that will take your mind off him.

I am affectionate of him. I would do anything to make sure he is content.
If girls do not feel an emotional connection with their lover, the relationship will not go on.
Are you confused if you desire one?
He will be in trouble if he does not remain silent about the matter.
Others have told me that it is not usual in our society to have only one friend and for that friend to be female.
Loving him requires that you trust him implicitly.
I doubt that you will be able to cope with the disapproval of the others.
I believe in lust at first sight, but love?
It depends on the girl.
You should always be the person that you are.

It is up to the guy if he is interested.

Anywhere the two of you want to.
If so, he probably feels obligated.
How can I break up with someone like that and they turn around and spend $108 on a birthday gift for me?
You could always get married.  No, wait, do then you'll never get laid!
If you are not married, you should end the relationship.
I believe that if you wonder if you are in love, you are not in love.
I will be going to the first event.
You should spend more time with your wife.
Love is sometimes considered as the first step to having sex, but there is also pure love without sex.
I recommend that you not do it regardless of what she says.
You should stab at something in close proximity and then move in.
If you have seven setbacks in life then get up eight times.
So called good girls who want to try and live on the wild side for excitement are attracted to bad boys.
This is a normal reaction; even some women find sexy girls to be attractive.
It occurs only on days that end in the letter "y."
Apparently this person wants to have a family with me.
Do you get anxious if you don't see this person even for a short time?
That is not a good idea at any time.
He would find it unusual but that does not mean it would not have a positive outcome.
What type of party did you have?  Do you know if he even likes parties?
I think she is trying to indicate that she is ready for physical contact.
Every man has a different preference in woman; some like the Ginger type while others prefer the Marry Ann type.
I would not ask him where is is going.  He probably needs some space to thinks things over and questioning his need for this space will only harm the relationship more.
You will only get hurt in the end.
It is up to you, but if I had to do it over again, I would not.
I assume that you are trying to see if he would cheat on you.
I just do not think there is hope.
Perhaps intimacy over the phone with each other.
For example, if you are a shy male, it may be difficult to ask for a date.
You should inform her about how important she is to you.
My family was accepting of it, but I know there are some families that do not accept it.
Yes, I have and I benefited from it. I found a superior person that has more affection for me.
Whatever happens, do the best that you can do.
Otherwise, I agree with you entirely.
Try one with a special room, the empty side, or the outside.
I'm not being gross, do you understand what I'm indicating?
If it's warm enough, find a lake that rents paddleboats for a rate of 5 dollars per hour.
Why do I want him back?
So my advice to you is: get out there, have fun, mingle, discover new things, be authentic, and laugh.
If he loves you, then he'll wait for you.
that he's not ready for you, and you shouldn't be preoccupied with him.
He's transgender, and has since transitioned. He wouldn't be a good match for you.
If he's your boyfriend, then you should break up with your partner. Else, you should forget about it and move on.
I gave him a nice card for Christmas.
Think about the situation. A man does all of this for you, but you are still not happy?
If you love Jesus Christ first, he will bless you.
I am going to a place with a pool table.
You have never even seen a picture of her.
I just checked, and they have versions of the song.
Health or sickness; rich or poor; better or worse.
Just wait. You know the saying goes: "Boys only want one thing."
If he is nice, then maybe things will work out this time!
No, it's not bad at all.
Hello mate, your problem is the same as mine.
Only you can answer that question, but it is not legal in some places.
He also says it bothers him when guys leave me comments.
I'm a young teen and i definitely do like girls that speak their mind.
No, it is not bad at all.
Hello, friend, you and I have the same problem.
Only you can answer that question, but it is not legal in some places.
He says it bothers him, too, that men leave me comments.
Well, I'm a young teen and I definitely do like girls that speak their mind.
When you are 'in love' with someone it happens.
What is they wanted to wait until they got married?
My mother always said that actions speak louder than words.
If you are wondering whether it is love then it isn't as yet.
My girlfriend used to get jealous quite often.
If you don't want a child, you must use a condom.
I believe you should answer that question.
Say something different, similar to, "Hello. I am Joseph Blow. Nice to meet you.".
It helps sometimes, if you picture yourself telling them, that you love them.
If you recall, Her ex boyfriend was not a good man. He cheated on her.
You should inquire whether he likes men.
As far as I'm concerned, if a guy is shy about showing interest in a girl sending her a note would be a good way to start.
My boyfriend engages in many activities of which I do not approve.
You should tell then to let you know.
If she believes that he is mature then she will admit to being fond of him.
There is one man I like in a romantic way, I have yet to speak to him.
Males think on sexual things at all times.
This is the cause behind the divorce rate being so high.
Greetings, would you like to be my male romantic partner?
Love does not cost anything, and those things that do cost can not be true love.
I am interested in one man, but I never engage him in conversation.
All men think about sex constantly.
This is the reason why the divorce rate is so high.
Pardon me, but would you like to be my boyfriend?
Love is always free, and that which is not free cannot be true love.
Did he behave like this before you married him?
What will you do now with your free time?
It is dependent both on the weather and were you live.
When someone loves you, they watch out for you.
If you have been spending time with a man for over a month.
Any information that you can find would be much appreciated.
Does it matter if she loves you as well?
Regardless of what happens, she is too special for you to part ways.
Is it possible to have a free, or mostly free wedding, without having to do a television show?
If you are in love, your life is going to be difficult.
Do you intend to keep the promise you made?
Please speak to that person's best friend.
And it is not this man.
Would you love that person regardless of whether or not that happened?
I don't want to be noisy.
But it was oh so much fun getting there.
When you talk about other girls, she gets mad.
I do not want to pry.
But getting there was fun.
It is is my room, so I can watch.
She becomes angry when you talk about other girls.
Because it's a huge deal for me.
Once you guys get on the topic ask her if you might have a chance.
Because they enjoy having sex with someone new.
It cuts in both directions I believe.
When you are not a fan of something do you call it gay?
Be courted by an alternatively selected individual while neglecting to inform any individuals.
(Abbreviated response ... inquire from him directly as to his areas of enjoyment!)
I have knowledge that my male significant other exhibits a feeling of caring towards me.
I have the knowledge that the reference reads correctly as the pleasant elderly United States of America.
You males enjoy being flirtatious with one another (for instance, tickling sessions, mock fighting matches, pursuing one another) (7)
When you are unattractive, what is there to risk?
Why do people not fancy African girls?
You need to learn more about the situation.
I completely sympathize with you.
Men do not mess around like women.
However, he is a man with three children and married.
It is difficult, however that will cause you to sleep up and he will be aware of the deceit.
I am a female, but  I do not understand it.
Is it a good thing to remain a virgin, if a male, until marriage.
Tell him that you two can be friends, with the possibility of something happening later.
That will likely take all of the stress off of you.
The best place to find a date would be college. The best place to take someone on a date is definitely not a club.
Simply examine the size of his testicles. Clearly state to him that they are looking smaller and watch his response.
If you have a sense of style and hygiene, you will attract a guy.
You need to question her frequently about what she feels for you.
Show her, or tell her how much you love her.
If he truly loves you. He'll change his ways.
That's' what I see. I'm an average man.
I agree with them. Mother nature gives her the role of feeding and protecting.
If you are not willing to do it, someone should be.
Go to Google.com and type in "e-card", and then you can proceed from there.
What is the best way I can communicate that I am concerned for her feelings?
Men do not like to be with a weak woman.
It is possible you have too many Trixies in your life.
I know many men who are attracted to slender women; I think that it's just personal taste.
They can do so but it does not appear to be likely.
I suggest that you don't think of it as spying.
He was constantly on my mind at all times.

It simple means that when you do, that person will get the best of you.
If so, how much does the celebration warrant?

Using sex as a weapon is unacceptable.
However, that does not mean you do not have a chance with them.

Do not let anyone interupt your work duties and you should be fine.
the key is to practive and be confident so you will not fail with the one you have chosen.
there is not only one answer to the question
So I just avoid doing it.
Do you think the rhythm is right for you?
If it is not a good date then there is no reason to kiss.
You should ask him to marry you and see what happens!
You should trust yourself, demand reciprocity and seek what you desire.
Once a person cheats they will cheat again.
You don't have to be married to make a family for your kids, provided, of course, the dad will stick around.
Or, he might act like he loves your kids just to have sex with you and then go on his way.
Try to convince her that you are not intending to cheat her daughter.
So you need to put out better or improve your actions and he will like you better.
Discuss it with your doctor.
There is a side of your personality that your boys will never see.
Some surprises never seem to work out.
I like when a girl touches me.
It is actually good to do that.
Men should grow up to be rugged, strong, men.
Are you torn between two lovers? Do you feel foolish? Loving both people constitutes a breach of all the rules of love.
If you are really interested in her, first you may want to see what she looks like.
Well, if he cannot let her go, then you must break things off with him.
Because they have not decided yet.
They do not have sexual relations with every man.
ARE YOU TORN BETWEEN TWO LOVES AND FEEL LIKE A FOOL? BREAK ALL THE RULES AND LOVE THEM BOTH!
YOU MAY LIKE HER VERY MUCH BUT FIRST WISH TO CHECK HER LOOKS.
IF HE CANNOT LET YOU GO, THEN YOU MUST LET HIM GO.
THEY HAVE NOT MADE THEIR MINDS UP.
THEY DO NOT SLEEP WITH EVERY MAN.
I did not get a chance to say goodbye. Can anybody help me?
You are just another random person with some useful advice.
He probably wants to buy you out with his money.
Well, I can relate to that.
Go all the way, but do not blow your load on one girl.
Thank you for the advice you gave me in regards to my vacation question!
You are most definitely not asking for too much.
By December 16th, 2005, they should be awake.
With most men, they cannot tell when exactly they are about to come, anyway.
If you are my student, could you please call me?
You made a fatal mistake with this one.
Could it just be an argument between nations?
Another possibility would be if your mother asked during Christmas dinner.
If you are a lesbian.
Explain what your concerns are about her getting married to him.
Can you cook too?
This matter will depend on other factors.
I cannot relate, but three months have passed.
I feel like more love can be found from other black females.
Should I be patient or talk to him first?
If he hurt you that deeply twice, that is too much.
I just have to ask this, because I have to know.
Tell her that you like her more then a friend, that you love her and will she accept your proposal.
Do not let go of hope. Hope gives you strength to keep you going.
This a frequently asked question on Y! channel.
They will tell you after the fact.
Do not forget to consider your health.
I find a man at work attractive.
Sometimes she will try to remind you how the sex was, by bending over or flirting.
Refrain from relations with married people.
That should be a big clue to let you know that she's not the right girl for you.
Then you need to go back to giving her the attention she wants.
In my opinion, adolescents are more interested in sex than in the romance of love.
He is dating my friend now, but I still think there is a chance I can get him to like me.
Is it really necessary for you to ask this question?
Sexual relationships are only for married couples.
I don't know why, but women seem to love ears.
If you can really trust your boyfriend then you would not worry about him flirting with others.
It would be wrong to make us dance because we are not good dancers.
Please let him know as soon as possible.
Take your time. Gentlemen prefer a relaxed pace before eating.
Do not degrade yourself. He is attached to your friend. You may return for his remains later.
Please feel free to ask question. Please avoid mentioning religion, sex, or politics.
It is hard to maintain a false facade.
Every one finds you attractive.
Here is an age old male secret.
If you want to know something don't talk about it just ask.
Your children should always be first no matter what age.
Let the guy chase the girl.
Whenever I feel like showing love, I kiss her.
Are they driving you crazy not wanting sex?
People change girlfriends every week.
Good question. Now I know what to tell my girlfriend I want.
Has he ever had his hair cut short?  Maybe when your first met him?
What else can I do, I feel that I have tried everything!
I hate diseases because I don't like to see babies suffer.
Are you talking about the guys that your previously dated?
You should always put your feelings first, and his should be second.
It honestly depends on the particular girl.
They couldn't wait until they were all grown up.
You are already determined to see the faults and downfalls in people.
I am not even certain whether she would like me to ask her out or not.
That is the kind of thing that gets other good things started.
I feel like this street may only be one way.
May I ask her the details of this proposal?
Sometimes certain models like men who are average because they are down to earth with them.
Please just relax and take your time, you will find that you have a better time.
You must be patient, someday you will find someone that loves you for who you are.
I'm almost certain he is hiding something that he doesn't want you to know.
You should definitely take her to small claims court.
He said he was returning to his home state whether or not I agreed to go with him.
Just joking, but maybe you should hold your breath when you perform oral sex so you don't suffocate.
Have you ever tried talking to one to see if there was mutual attraction?
Just say what you mean and stop assuming people get the hint.
This guy could be a fake.
A friends mother gave herthis advice- be careful who you date because you just might fall in love with them.
The big question that I have is: do you work as well?
Although you know that means giving up your own; no matter how bad and long you hurt.
When she is around you she does things you don't like, maybe you shouldn't be friends with her.
Which are you referring to, a friend or your wife and her feelings?
Other do not see things as you do, so they don't understand.
I don't think so, I don't trust and I don't sleep!
Maybe because, there is no one there with them to tell them not to.
Is he more friendly and affectionate with you, or is he just that way with everyone?
What do you speculate her problem to be?
And honestly, why wouldn't a man desire a beautiful, young woman?
I met a girl on the phone, we become very good friends.
Afterwards, I purchased a loaf oa bread.
I mean, I am a man, and I am not judging. What would happen if you asked them the question?
All joking aside... there is no reason not to meet him, unless he is not who he says he is.
You might find out later, that you lost the perfect one.
Nice guys don't like nice girls.
The same things that not attractive women like.
I am 51 years old which make it hard, but I have to do it.
In my opinion it will happen if it is meant to be.
It is, and it is not a turn off if you have children.
If they are in love and there are no objections then they should.
In other words, she seems interested, so it would be a good time to propose.
Quickly lead her to the bedroom.
From the beginning, this has been the case, since we are both employed.
Masturbation is acceptable if necessary when remembering.
Have casual sex, but do not get committed since you are so young.
Attempt asking her what she enjoys.
You should simply proceed with being proud. She is a professional player.  Merry Christmas.
Do you two have a friendship?
Do not waste time thinking of your old one.
Go around the corner and have your fill of liquor or food. However, as you know, liquor is never good.
Then she saw that I did not care, so she went for it.
I just admire the woman's facial beauty and her good looks.
How do I make it special?
Did you ever give them a chance?
If you find that guy, you will be happy and it will last.
Ensure that you will be able to understand one another.
It may intimidate boys but never men.
My former boyfriend's sister and I were very close at one point.
Yes, it does for my girlfriend.
However, once upon the dance floor, they feel intimidated.
Take time to let your feelings develop and become clear.
That would be because he has made it clear he is interested in a girl who is very bad, a show off, and prettier than me.
In order to figure out that feeling, give them a little bit.
I would advise forgiving her, getting your man, and moving on.
What happened to prayer in school?
What's funny is I know all of these things, but I do not have a girlfriend.
You have not found the correct one.
First, your children should be your priority.
What do you enjoy?
The exact way you have before!
If he is still unpleasant deep down then it may work but is not worth the risk
I said I would resign my teaching job also.
It relies on who the guy is.
Great question but you did not provide information on your charactor.
IF DEEP DOWN IN HIS HEART HE IS COLD AND UNKIND, IT MAY WORK OUT BUT IT IS SELDOM WORTH IT.
I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD QUIT MY TEACHING JOB AND GO AS WELL.
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE MAN.
NICE QUESTION BUT YOU DID NOT TELL ME OF YOUR CHARACTER.
Why not just be friends with him and nothing more?
I have had a lot of trouble with girls in the past, so if you could help me out it would be nice.
He does not love you beyond your body.
Never stop smiling because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.
Am I going to get hurt?
You can start with a punch line.
There's a generation gap between you two.
Why haven't you asked her out?
When they have sexual relations with each other, they are considered lesbian.
The most important thing is not to give up!
In all reality, that would be like dating your mother.
What if the guy turns out to be a jerk?
It seems like he doesn't care. If I were in your shoes, I'd do the same.
How do I start?
My brother, we shall go into the breech, once more.
It is like having your cake and eating it, as well.
I will go with One's answer. Vote for One ! Vote for One !
However, it is not always true.
After you meet and have known him for some time, then, yes, it is possible to do that.
Well, it depends on how much you love her.
I am a decent girl but, I have to admit that bad men definitely can affect you.
Shower a woman with all of your attention then, after awhile, ignore her.
I am not able to ask her due to my sheer amount of shyness!
At times I felt as though I was having chest pains!
Don't act in a different way just to get attention. Simply be yourself.
One way to look at it would be to say that there is no such thing as an ugly woman, just one who is barely pretty.
It is equivalent to why men do not like women to have male friends.
I am a man, and yet I could not answer that with any degree of certainty. What would sexy mean?
One of men's unfavorable characteristics is how they always want to be considered right, even when they are wrong.
Are you asking how to get a boy to like you?
I never heard from him again, and then nearly two years later on Christmas Day, I found out he had passed away.
Just wear some clothing that makes you look sexy and turn on the charm.
Bring her a red rose, and take her somewhere she likes.
Some of them taste better than others.
ASK HER ON A DATE AND TAKE THAT RISK, YOUNG MAN.
IF YOU REALLY LOVE HER THAT MUCH, THEN ASK HER TO MARRY YOU FOREVER.
I HAVE MANY MEN FRIENDS THAT I HANG OUT WITH AS FRIENDS ONLY.
I WOULD SAY TO JUST GO WITH YOUR HEART, AND THAT IS THE BEST I CAN DO.
Dude, take the risk and ask her out.
If you really love her that much, maybe you should ask her to marry you.
I have plenty of male friends and we hang out.
I am watching Dead Fish Ollec the Fish Slayer
I would say, go flow with your heart. That is my best advice right now.
I can say beyond any doubt that I am emotionally ready.
I find my boyfriend's jealousy humorous.
My girlfriend and I have been together five and a half years.
He is not being fully forthcoming with you.
I wish things would change.
I need to get to know someone in order to have feelings for them.
It is impossible to know, so you should just take the risk as long as you want to.
I have a similar situation. I have been dating a man for two weeks.
One option would be to use Yahoo Search and type in his Yahoo name and look for him.
Take a deep breath once in awhile.
I don't like it when they act like they don't need to accept the truth.
It looks as though you both are in a difficult position.
You are not my student, but the answer it the same.
I felt the same way before.
It all depends on how the date went.
You now have to equality you desired.
If you need to know, you already do.
Go out with friends and talk.
Not unless you are together.
This website can make a variety: www.cheap-check.com
I would not do it myself, but is it wrong? In this era, no.
It is because they hate being wrong. That is how my boyfriend is.
If you like someone, you will have to help them with anything they might need.
If she desired you also, then it was wrong.
After many years, you become one with your partner by understanding each other.
So as to not regret anything.
I do not think that six is as common as that.
Not if you do not want her to be angry.
Support your daughter, no matter her decisions and actions.
Do you want to go see if it is Friday night?
I guess it comes down to your definition of love.
There is nothing wrong with that as long as he is being treated in an acceptable manner.
Friend, if you want certain girls to like you, you need to stop acting stupid around them.
I think you should wait to have sex until both of you are ready.
That is what the majority of men think about.
THAT WOULD SURPRISE ME.
WHEN HE HURTS BE THERE FOR HIM.
SMELL THIS ,D YOU THINK IT STINKS?
FROM THE LOOKS OF YOUR PICTURE, IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT.
IN THE MEANTIME JUST WORK ON BETTERING YOURSELF AND PREPARING FOR WHAT YOU WANT.
That would surprise me.
When he is in pain, be by his side.
In your opinion, does she smell bad?
From the appearance of your photograph, it would not be difficult.
In the meantime, work on improving yourself and preparing for what you want.
Some guys really dont care.
Start seeing other women. That should work for good.
All girls are at least not me. Contact me at holagurrl411@yahoo.com
Or, is that going to make things hurt more?
He is quite mature, isn't he?
There is no way to break up with a guy and not hurt him.
Fine, if you do not want me, let me know and I will bounce, it is not that deep.
Make it a bit more universal, like "No Fear" or something.
A great name for a punk band!
Be yourself with a little bit of spreading, being the best in you.
Please instant message me with the correct answer.
Ask yourself if you really love him.
Can you please tell me where they are as I cannot find them?
I like to wear briefs because I like how they fit.
I do not want to go back to the way things were, but I would like to be friends.
We have three children: a fifteen-year-old and a pair of three-year-old twins.
That remains to be seen. Outwardly, I have the attitude of a street punk, but deep down I am a nice person.
I do not know what a surrendered wife is.
All people love to talk about themselves—even those who pretend they do not.
If a gentleman is interested in a female, he should be the first to call her.
You may tell the woman what you would like to tell her.
Have love for yourself no matter what you go through. You will admire your hard honest work and accomplishments.
She turned her life around, gave up promiscuity and chose to follow a clean life.
Life is short, enjoy yourself while it lasts.
Do the best as a simple man.
After that day, you will find out that your relationship with Yahoo is over.
Be funny, talk about interesting things, and tape twenty dollar bills onto your body.
Do not worry whether or not you have a guy.
Sadly, you are the fourth person who has asked this question.
Am I just too paranoid?
Guys can never go wrong with a woman if they give her jewelry.
Women can not have it both ways.
They would still think about it for a moment before they say no.
You say that you are young. If that is the case, it is supposed to be like that.
You should start with heavy petting, then move on to cunnilingus.
I suppose that is the first step.
I love when a man wears boxer brief underwear.
That sounds very strange and silly. Can you define what you think an online relationship is?
Most women would not ask a man on a date.
You can check the Yellow Pages for more information
I did not mean to make you feel uncomfortable, and I am feeling slightly nervous
Immediately after the date or on the day itself
It's not in the immediate MI, Clare area.
Guys dislike it when they feel that others are nagging at them
No, if you really love someone, then monogamy is your only option.
Why would you want three girlfriends?
Yes, it is important to discuss that with your physician.
Also, please remember that your wife is infallible.
It is like losing a loved one.
Send a reply to the email when you can.
Let us make a list and disclose everything you want to.
He wants to watch football and have sex at the same time.
I am looking for the entire quote, but for now, I only have this part.
Your virginity is very special and, should be saved for someone you really care about.
You should try to go to parties and places where he may be.
There are many women out there that will be interested in you.
You should do it in a church.
Sex is not love, it is just lust.
When you are working on a task, take your time, do not rush.
Do you mean what you are telling me?
The card that I bought says that you complete the dozen.
Some people in relationships take their significant other for granted. They do not appreciate their partner, but would rather them not be with anyone else.
Are two dozen roses too many roses to give to someone?
Did that make you orgasm?
If I am with him he is okay with my staying at home and not working.
I do not think it will work if he is really a gentleman.
I was offered a position in another state that I am really not intereste din.
Do not tell her that you are planning to stay with your wife. She will simply be bitter.
Stop and ask her for directions or something else minor in order to start a conversation.
If your family likes your girlfriend and your girlfriend does not care for your family.
Her fate has already been determined.
Because men are disloyal to women and we know hoe that results.
That is an unfortunate sign, my friend.
You should love everybody the same way you love God.
Have her send you a picture first, and then send her your picture.
Judging by their response, their answer is most likely "no."
This holds especially when most people are not adept at that skill.
I think if the man is interested we ought to be able to call at least every other day.
What is a major cause of people being disloyal? Boredom with their partner.
No one does unless they are psychic or similar.
No, it frightens them but causes them to later become confident, if not arrogant.
If women desired it as much as men we, as a society, would not advance much.
I am never embarrassed or ashamed to be with him.
Do not be afraid. The color of her blood is the same as yours.
I do not want any conflict. I only want to get my dress back from you.
He agrees that I am an affable, close friend to him.
If that is so, tell her that reaching climax will not affect that.
That is how it goes, I guess.
I am free to do as I please.
I love this girl very much, but I have no idea how to start!
He sits around a lot playing Play Station 2.
You know when there is no real way to say something but it is something you know.
At the age of sixteen, I decided I wanted adventure in my life.
Make sure she does not read any beauty or celebrity magazines.
Does it matter if he is gay?
You should spend more time in sexually explicit positions.
You cannot force someone to harbor affection.
I am having trouble understanding your question. However, it seems you tend to attract younger men.
I find the ring that I am wearing to be sufficient.
I greeted C and asked what C was doing.
I have observed this occurrence on too many occasions so you must leave before the situation escalates beyond control.
I understand, therefore I have enough respect for him to refrain from doing it.
Who is concerned with physical appearance as personality is the meaningful attribute.
Perhaps another possibility is her possession of intimacy issues, however I suppose we will never know.
It is difficult to find that in these current times therefore it is more difficult to provide for a woman.
Could the ones you are attempting to be Hoosiers, by chance?
Offer small gifts now and then and tell her jokes.
My girlfriend did the same and then left when I told her to find a job.
If you do not already know then you should ask your mother.
Examine these facts and then ask yourself if you you are strange or very strange.
That outcome would be perverted, or perhaps reversed.
The result depends on how strongly you beleive in love.
Additionally, I've become aware that she does not often return calls.
Please proceed to the directory containing all yahoo members.
Have you considered using a dating website, such as, Yahoo Personals, etc.
Mostly we forget that and let the birds run away.
Because they love him and do not know how to get out of the marriage.
You are practically married, just no paperwork.
Rather through a note or email. Unless she likes it when you ask in person.
She was scared that I would not like it.
SINGLE MOTHERS CANNOT LEAVE THE HOME OR ARE TOO LAZY.
MOST MEN ARE INTERESTED IN YOUNGER WOMEN.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO?
REMEMBER TO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND DRESS WELL.
Either single mothers cannot leave the house, or they are just too lazy to leave the house.
Most men prefer younger women!
What do you have to do?
Remember to keep a look out and wear something nice.
Act as though she does not exist.
They are better than other people, and can get away with it.
No. I think it is a bad idea to sleep with people for whom you have no feelings.
My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years.
It just about drove my husband crazy.
I would agree with Nichole's statement.
They think about how attractive the women appear.
Be sure not to take it overly far.
They are both aware and he is always kind however she hates me.
I would like to emphasize that I am offended although I was not the person she said it to.
Do not change for the purpose of attracting a man.
In that case, you should call her and suggest that you talk.
Women, as well as men, are unfaithful.
If it was not true, the two of you would be simply friends.
This is not a site that directs you to sites that sell pornography.
The waterfall was a great experience but that was all we could hear.
We are not going to sit on our butts.
I was joking about the last choice.
Some are pleased with the decision; others not so much.
Chivalry is rare now.
If you call him he will want to talk.
What ever needs to be said, say it now.
That would be difficult I believe.
Your partner will have total faith in you.

A marriage takes work, but can be very satisfying.
You need to socialize more. You will have fun and meet some girls to talk with.
Can you give me a call please?
Please let me know if you ever find a perfect man.
Do not allow your enemy to discourage you.
I wish I could say honesty, but even that can backfire.
But now, she looks sad everyday.
But that is only for extroverted people.
I believe that it should not matter how many men you have been intimate with.
Just be patient, and pray to God. Ask him who the best husband for you is!
Believe me, you deserve so much better.
If you want your man to dress more nicely, buy his clothes you have picked.
She has to want it for herself.
You can chat with me at cold_dark_storm@yahoo.com
Do you remember where you got that nice dress?
I would get him two dozen roses because the more roses you buy him, the more he will love you.
Married men tend to be more mature because they have more experience when it comes to handling relationships.
When did you break up, and why were you so jealous?
I'm still trying to find out, so if you find out first, please let me know.
Do not let them get too close.
I always thought people were sure they wanted marriage when they got engaged.
I do not want a confrontation, but I am still upset with her after an incident four years ago.
Hello, it is good know you care for the girl.
If you find him attractive, try flirting and see how he reacts.
Love is a feeling, but feelings are not love.
Find a girl you want to go out with, and without thinking about it, ask her out.
you might find out that you have to stick with her the rest of the remaining year.
Love to see full big ones, pretty eyes, that are not butch looking.
Maybe he has never thought of you in that way.
In Ohio where I live, you do not see much chivalry there either.
If you have something in common, it would be wise to use it.
What in the world would she do if her son was to die in real life?
He does, however, always quit or gets fired, from one job to the next.
I am not even sure how he feels about me.
Leave your home in pursuit of other interests, as it pleases you.
Do you recall who was unfaithful? They were.
Have any of you found love with two sisters simultaneously?
As if speaking those words would change the depth of feeling I have for them.
Take care and be prepared for an audio disturbance on your video tape.
I love new getting new clothing.
Once you get married, you become one, you will have to give and take.
He want someone to feel sorry for him.
You are the one.
I am blind in one eye.
If both people do not make it worth their while, then it will not be.
You will know, because you will get a gut feeling.
Most the time when you fall for a great girl, it is just infatuation.
Spending time apart from your partner, will help you know if he likes you or not.
He is not interesed in you.
Excuse me, Kempie. Please explain the train analogy
A gentleman has a different mode of thought than a lady. Please give him time understand the situation better.
Please consider your feelings. Do not apply too much thought.
The situation would be far worse if I wasnt familair with the gentleman.
Just tell her that you really liked her, and she'll decide from there.
Anyways, don't burn your bridges, give them a chance to prove their worth.
The other user did not answer the question correctly.
I know quite a few beautiful girls who don't think they're beautiful.
Maybe he has a sister who uses the phone all the time.
It is easier because I am so attractive.
You know you should just do it.
I don't know the answer because I am not so sure that she got the message.
I am only 13 years old.  I am not sure.
I will not sleep well if I have any doubt in our relationship.
ON THE EAST SIDE OF PITTSBURGH IS BETO'S PIZZA, THE BEST PIZZA!
YOU DO NOT WANT EVERYONE IN YOUR WEDDING.
THERE IS SO MUCH PORN, AND YOU WANT TO PAY FOR IT?
IF YOU EVER GAVE THIS LINE TO A WOMAN, TELL ME WHY YOU DID.
What fancies her, what Baby Girl likes.
On the East Side (Pittsburgh), we eat at Beto's, it is the best pizza you will ever eat.
Dude, you do not want most of the people at your wedding to say that I had her.
Man, there is so much porn out there, must you pay?
If you ever used this line with a girl, please tell me why.
Show her, tell her, and draw her a diagram.
They are the ones who helped you come all the way here.
It matters more than it does for a guy.
She was accidentally bumped into.
He is going to be a young man.
Say that you are sorry and ask for forgiveness.
What do you do when you can not think of anything other than spending the rest of your life with her?
If you are not having sex it is because it is her choice.
Sometimes you need to play the game if you want to say ahead.
I do not understand, you are supposed to be wrong?  Right?
I keep expecting her to return.
Forget about him and enjoy the love you have.
One avenue to attempt is a Yahoo email search.
People like and desire the unattainable.
I purchase some flowers for my wife every few weeks.
When you meet the right mature man to settle down with, you will be happy.
When others ignore you, it does not mean that they do not like you.
I went out with someone and I kissed them on the first date.
I would prefer to get to know someone before I decide to go on a date with them.
I have a crush on a female who is older than me.
It isn't love if you have to question it.
There are still some nice gentlemen left out there!
Asking a girl out in a message is rude.
You have to take risks if you want to achieve things.
No, I am not talking about intercourse.
Well, you could try asking your wife.
Think of things you know he enjoys doing.
Why will she not ask me out?
Disease, because innocent people get that too.
Sorry, I just want to know how many girls have received this line or how many guys have given it.
OH, LEAVE THEM ALONE, PEOPLE WILL LEARN FROM GETTING BIT. - HONDA LANE
AND WHAT IT DOES NOT WORK ITS WAY OUT?
I DO NOT MEAN WITH WAR EITHER WAY.
IF YOU ARE A WOMAN THEN IT IS WONDERFUL TO DO.
WHAT IF YOU LOVE THIS PERSON COMPLETELY?
"You should leave him alone.  People learn by getting Bit."  Hondo Lane.
What if it does not work out?
I do not mean with war, either.
If you are a girl, then it is awesome to do.
What if you like this person?
Tell her that you are in love, but not to whom, and then guage her reaction.
Which is more important in the grand scheme, a temporary infatuation, or your abiding friendship with her?
That situation would be far from ideal, correct?
Women never express displeasure of the fact that I am posession of merely five.
I am non-caucasian, and stand six feet tall at the age of twenty-seven.

IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO IT IF IT
If you can get over that, then you are straight.
Let me know if it works.
Did you tell him? You were really serious then.
It is because you want to get back together with him.
You could just email me the money.  I could give you my email address if you want it.
IF YOU CAN GET OVER THAT, YOU ARE STRONG.
PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF IT WORKS WELL.
ARE YOU REALLY SERIOUS?
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET BACK WITH HIM AS HIS GIRLFRIEND, YOU WOULD DO THAT?
YOU COULD JUST EMAIL THE MONEY THROUGH PAYPAL. WOULD YOU LIKE MY ADDRESS?
If you do not like it, just move on to the next category.
I am afraid that she might get angry or that she well not like me.
Do not pull away too quickly. You know he likes you if he pulls you back in.
It depends on who it is and how the date went.
I have noticed that I get annoyed with men who, for reasons I don't know, want to have sexual relations.
Love seems more sweet in the beginning of a relationship.
I would love a card that offered me a free back scratch, massage, or free kiss.
I feel that this situation is not good at all.
Look around and you should be able to find what you are looking for.
If your family is similar to my family, what you are telling me may be true.
What do you suggest I do for her?
Take things day by day, as love may frighten him.
Keep dating until you find the right person for you.
Do not ruin a good friendship.
I do not think that is romantic at all, but I do think flatulence is comical.
WHAT IS THAT PERSON DI NOT LIKE YOU BECAUSE YOU HAD SHORT HAIR, ETC?
THIS WILL BE AN INVESTMENT FOR YOUR FUTURE.
YOU JUST THINK OF ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE SITUATION.
SHOWING YOUR LOVE IS ABOUT ALL THE LITTLE THINGS YOU DO FOR SOMEONE YOU LOVE.
You should not judge people because what if someone did not like you because your hair was short?
If you continue to do this, it will pay off for your financial future.
If someone says Koigokoro temae, that is Chinese for I love you.
Make sure you think about all the positives and negatives.
Part of caring about someone is showing your love for them.
He manipulating you to make you feel that you are indebted to him.
You should simply enjoy living your life and love others.
The situation is not ideal.
If you are attracted to a person, then why not?
Ask yourself if she is worth waiting for, and are you willing to wait?
Shart checking out the other guys and let him know how it feels.
You shoudl not have had an affair. The damage is already done.
If the relationship is only sexual you should be sure to use protection.
Some people know the possibility of divorce even when they are getting married.
You should not let him know that you are thinking about leaving him.
He always buys me whatever I want, but he does not want anything from me.
You should first make sure that she is available.
I think women see things differently than we men do.
Simply walk up and ask him if he would like to go out with you.
That would be Britney Spears behind, or Carmen Electra's mouth.
I would have instantly said yes if I'd had the choice.
However, if she is just being polite, and is not actually interested in you.
I am acquainted with a man who met his wife in the same manner.
I have been unfaithful and had others be unfaithful to me.
Direct your attention to this statement that men expel and women retain.
In the event of another man arriving at your home to take her, would you not be slightly envious?
They could possibly be sexual addicts.
It impresses me when a man does not try to hard.
She has to date a lot more guys to find one that she really likes.
Honestly, it is not a big deal.
If there is hate around, it is easily noticeable.
I asked you how many drinks?
As for me, it is a feeling I can never put into words.
It is so intense not to notice; you will certianly know if it happens.
If he looks at other women when you are not around then, it is alright.
Unless, perhaps, you do not mind other men having intercourse with your woman.
It depends on if he really cares for you or not.
Do you have a good figure or are you extremley beautiful
Cool chick with hot ass is what I like
If you find a good girl you wont want to marry some one else
My feelings are you are more lonely than in love
If he gave you something what would happen
I would like to be with the brunette.
If you would like to have an American girlfriend, you should go to the United States.
I would say no since you even asked that question.
That is because they are simply bored, with nothing better to do.
If you are unsure but thinking of asking someone, then just go ahead and do it.
If he stalks you, call the police.
You have to marry him to know what kind of husband he will be. Family life changes everybody. Merry Christmas!
Many women and men prefer an uncut guy.
You have to enter his full name.
Why would you want to see her toes?
I think you should be forward and ask him.
This is the first time that I have heard of this.
You have no legal recourse.
I love him; however, he is married and I need assistance in ending our relationship and dealing with a feeling of depression.
Everyone has an unconventional side.
I believe the majority of women are high maintenance and difficult to deal with.
I do not believe you will be able to live up to a life-long commitment.
Please stop pestering him and give him a beer to drink.
You may want to pay attention to her.
GOOD LUCK FINDING THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR IT!
IF YOU REALLY DO WANT HELP ON THIS MAIL ME AT ACRIYAZ@GMAIL.COM.  GOODBYE!

If she turns you down, take some time and do not go on to the next girl.
Just look into her eyes :)
It is in the people search section.
Yes it indeed does, to a certain extent.
She refused you one already; I assume that intels that you two were not truly together?
Is she or the man you are infatuated with more important to you?
I only speak of this from experience!
If you trust him, meet his family and hope for the best.
She expects a boy to do the things about which she is thinking- do you understand?
You missed him or her when he or she was gone.
Secondly, he might respect you, unlike most men, and not want to cause problems with you.
Gentlemen are sometimes too attainable.
You should be unfaithful while she is being unfaithful.
He is trying to find an opportunity to be unfaithful.
I do not think that it is wrong.
I did not realize I am so sick.
You should show her what a nice and caring guy you are.
I like to french kiss and make out.
If you can prove that they have it, you should take them to small claims court.
The answer is no, there is no chance with him.
Aside from a tree, some men would probably like some polo boots for the wonder. It really depends on the age.
They have kept a friendship since her divorce.
Did you try to turn around?
To ask a girl out that you like, do not sweat it and practice it in the mirror.
These kind of women usually end up with a man who does not accept drama.
Give your friend the space to follow their own desires.
In addition, it feels more painful when the other person does not seem to be bothered by the break up.
Yes. If you ask nicely, you may get something even more from him.
I would suggest you ask them. I have not heard anything.
What is she is realy mean or crazy?
Go to the arcade, go cart riding, bowling, or play pool.
Perhaps she is thinking the same thing, about how to tell if he still loves me.
Anywhere, I prefer somewhere nice.
I say no, because if he has done that to you once, it will probably happen again.
you will always come back to him.
Or, you could just talk to him.
If she likes you she will uunderstand.
It might be that your wife only had cybersex, but that is still sex.
I need one for a guy I like.
The whole saying about guys mature a few years.
So flirt with one of them and you will be in love.
A gravitational force which pulls you.
Girls never go for sensitive guys.
I would take her with me, then go hang at the mall, but I like Rich's answer best.
If you have an unresolved issue, write a formal compalint and forward it to the appropriate group of people.
I would not exhibit that behavior in front of all individuals.
It is unclear why unmarried individuals with no intention of marriage engage in casual sex.
After celebrating Christmas for five years, my husband gifted me a leather jacket.
IF YOU STILL HAVE TROUBLE, FILE A COMPLAINT AND REVERSE TO THEM.
I WOULD NOT DO THAT TO JUST ANYONE.
WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SEX WITH PEOPLE THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF MARRYING?
MY HUSBAND RECEIVED A LEATHER JACKET FOR OUR FIFTH CHRISTMAS.
JUST HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH A MARRIED MAN.
Why are you looking for free? Do you have some money problem?
And finally, ask him why--what does she mean to him? Will it happen again?
No, she might reject you because she will think you want a relationship with her and her mom.
Or if you meet her at home, she will need to look for a vase to put it in.
I just will not waste my time.
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FREE THINGS, ARE YOU HAVING MONEY ISSUES?
ASK HIM WHAT SHE MEANS TO HIM OR WILL IT HAPPEN AGAIN.
SHE MAY BREAK UP WITH YOU BECAUSE SHE MAY NOT TRUST YOU WITH HER AND HER MOTHER.
IF YOU MEEET HER AT HOME SHE MAY NEED A VASE.
I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME.
You could just stay back and see how she handles it.
He is definitley a lowlife who sucks.
Does the penis size really matter?
Actually I know more women them men sexually.
Most of the guys that like big girls are really skinny.
This is tough because you said you are still in love with him, how long were you two together?
You can ignore the ones who said "alcohol."
You never know your luck, there could be a big percentage or a little one, good luck.
They only want one thing and it is not the responsibility of a family.
It would be foolish to believe that he would prefer to wait until marriage when that is clearly not the case.
It would best if you avoided places he frequents.
If you are confused about your sexuality, and you think you might be a homosexual male, then you will enjoy sleeping with men.
It is a pleasure to answer these questions!
Are you certain that you love him for who he is at this time?
It's the same as some women do, while some women do not.
I'm not putting anyone's ideas down. I am simply trying to think constructively.
Preferences for a woman include: long hair, nice legs and behind, and small breasts.
As I stated, allowing time would be the best advice.
He will not care.
YOU HAVE MY CONFIDENCE, I WISH YOU MUCH LUCK.
HOW DO I DO THIS?
I AM A WOMAN, AND I AM NOT A WOMAN.
MEN ARE MEN AND THEY TEND TO JUMP FROM ONE TOPIC TO ANOTHER.
I wish you the best of luck, I am confident in you.
Watch over the whole situation carefully.
I wonder how will I take care of this situation?
I am a girl, and personally I am not.
Guys usually just switch from one topic to another fairly fast.
I had sex on the internet with a random guy.
Also remember flowers. Flowers are a must.
I was really scared of one guy who was creepy.
Another option would be to use the personal ads on Yahoo. I am also looking for a part time lover.
However they are lacking in commitment, such as wanting marriage or children with you.
It is just having fun and pleasing one another.
First off, ask him if he is.
You will just know if you like someone.
i like redheads with a fine, sexy body.
If she does not set this guy straight, then maybe you should say something to her.
I really have feelings for this girl, but I am too shy to let her know.
Most girls do that because they have a strong feelings for them and you might want to impress them.
Just remember, a life-long commitment is just as it implies.
I REALLY LIKE THIS WOMAN, BUT I AM TOO SHY TO SPEAK TO HER.
MOST WOMEN DO BECASUE THEY HAVE A CRUSH, AND YOU WANT TO IMPRESS THEM.
JUST REMEMBER A LIFE LONG COMMITMENT IS JUST THAT, LIFE LONG.
CAN YOU HEAD IT OFF AT THAT PASS OR NOT?
GIVE HER A LINK LIKE A BLOG SITE YAHOO 360 OR MYSPACES.
I agree with catnip. My mother never cares about any of my boyfriends business.
The smaller something is, and the lower your self confidence, the worse your performance will be.
Wake up and smell the coffee.
Go out with friends, not necessarily males but females.
You are too high class to ask such a thing- keep your personality high and do not do it.
You could always point out people you see kissing.
Family In General Division. No thank you.
Follow along with whatever the best you have had would think.
In addition, he did not push for sex.
We have been together for 26 days, and I am hoping to have more days together.
I would say "good, keep looking."
How can I get her to love me?
Just do not go overboard with it.
Just the fact that you even put yourself in the position to watch her makes you a cheater.
If he likes older women, he probably likes mature women.
Please be sure to listen with your ears.
Whether or not they are attractive or not.
If he is jealous, he may not trust you and neither would I.
I began to date at the age of 14.
Actually, my girlfriend does it on occasion.
I have never actually used them, however my relationship is so exceptional it can not improve.
She may be a friend, family or a person you are already aware of.
When did I cease to do that?
Men hunt while women care for a nest.
My friends and family give me a hard time about the same issue.
Please let me know once you find out.
Let them know that you like them.
Remember that any man can sweep a lady off of her feet; he just needs the correct broom.
What personality attributes do you ladies look for in a man?
It will not work out. If he cheated on you once, he is sure to do so again.
It is because she does not think anyone would like to meet her in person.
** the first half of this sentence this is not in english!
Spend time with friends or alone, but not cheating.
Sorry to say it, but you still act like a child.
Going out. Do you still say that expression these days? Please, do me a favor. Do not act so desperate.
On that day, did he at least spend time with you?
Hello, do you have a little (insert ethnicity or race) in you?
It is the the same reason that men do.
Of course that is a good idea. Do not be too extravagant though. Something under twenty dollars should be fine.
That may introduce many more problems.
Excuse me, I find you very attractive.
I hope you receive a kick with adequate force to dislocate your jaw. I wish you good luck!
Gentlemen are strange in that they are simutaneously simple and complex. I believe every man engages in this activity atleast once.
I have surgically altered neither my breasts or my eyes.
Usually the way that you acquire a girlfriend is the same way that you will lose them.
The fact that I want her back is not going away.
I agree but only if he invites you to go along with the friends.
Soldier, is she in love with you?
I witnessed it myself.
Most people these days look only at the physical stuff.
Women can be as equally as guilty as men.
That way, she can get whatever she wants.
He said that if I died, he would kill himself. I humored him and said, ok.
Look for signs that she likes you.
Other people are drawn to that, and you will have more friends then you ever dreamed.
Only they are marture enough, though.
Smile, peck him, and give him a big hug.
Get a big piece of paper and write 'I love you."
Most girls only look for the waller, and they are idiots for doing so.
That is the only solution to your problem until you are capable of moving on.
As a matter of fact, I would not go on a date with him.
Perhaps you both could have a very strong relationship.
Do not bother another woman's partner.
Goodness, I became very tired writing that last sentence.
You can have one without the other one.
This your best friend and lover, and the one with whom you dream of growing old.
She is eighteen years old and big and girly.
From parenting Q & A: Question. Is it acceptable to discuss sex with my twelve year old ?
These past two weeks me and my best friend weren't as together as we used to be.
If you have been dating a short time, she might not be interested in you anymore.
If they are the one, you will know it.
It is not the end of the world if it goes wrong.
Break it to her gently that you do not wish her to be in your wedding.
Ok then; do you have a job?
KNOWING YOU, I THINK YOU CAN DEVOTE YOURSELF TO ONE PERSON.
I HEARD RAZ B SAY THAT TO SISTER TO SISTER MAGAZINE.
I AM SO CONFUSED , PLEASE ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.
DO NOT BE AFRAID, YOU MIGHT GET INVITED AND HAVE A BLAST.
FOR SEVERAL REASONS, ARE YOU LIEK EVERY OTHER MAN THAT DOES NOTHING BUT NORMAL THINGS?
I heard Raz B said that to "Sister to Sister" magazine.
I am very confused. Please help me resolve this.
Do not be frightened, you may be invited and enjoy yourself.
There are several reasons for this. Are you similar to every other man, doing nothing but eating, sleeping, defecating and watching television?
I can confirm that it does work from personal experience.
Personally speaking, I enjoy art.
Durex is a condom that will not break, regardless of its use.
I recommend Always Jewelry, although Chance by Channel is also good.
As a last resort, you could try a more risque Christmas gift.
You may kiss him.
Families are established in this way. I hope the two of you are happy.

Have you ever had a girlfriend you don't like, and teased and made fun of, and she suddenly become crazy about you ?
It is worth waiting for true love. He says that he is making an effort, so give him a chance.
But loving with eyes shut.
It is advisable to get tested with one's future spouse before marrying one another.
There is no way to keep a woman in a relationship if she no longer wants to be there.
This is because men make this sort of decision without fully thinking it through.
True love is not painful or harmful to the people in the relationship.
There are also significant cultural and religious differences involved.
Why did God set my mind when I cannot get him.
Well, it depends, especially for me.
I say this because once you cheat, you cannot stop.
The more she treats me like poop, the better.
Men see that as criticism, even though you so do not mean for it to be!
I like a girl that's in two of my classes.
He wanted to use it to kill her.
I don't care if you kissed her.
We played that game as kids.
Always trust your gut feeling.
I LIKE THIS GIRL I ONLY HAVE TWO CLASSES WITH HER.
HE TOLD ME HE TRIED TO KILL HER WITH THAT.
WHO CARES IF YOU KISSED SOMEONE?
WHEN WE WERE KIDS WE PLAYED THAT GAME.
YOUR GUT FEELING IS USUALLY CORRECT.
That does not apply to all guys, but most of them.
Please specify if it is a girlfriend, wife, stranger, friend, etc.
I think you must give more time for your relationship.
I went crazy and bought my boyfriend all kinds of things for our first Christmas.

In my opinion you are taking a chance either way.
If he says "yes", then you know it is over.
After how many hours would you say sex is too long?
Would you consider yourself a homosexual?
Be very genuine with the recommendation given to you.
If she does not break up with him...
Usually during the first date, the guy tries to impress you and somethign goes terribly wrong.
You just do not know about it.
Could it be that she is shy? Why not give it another chance and talk to her again?
Some men are sexier without hair.
When he gets along with his girlfriend.
You ought to ask a friend to do it.
I could discuss this forever, but in the end the answer is definitely no !
No, men just think that this is how women answer questions.
When I was eighteen I had a great relationship with a thirty seven year old.
TRY TO KNOW DETAILS ABOUT HER.
IF LOVE IS RESPECTFUL AND MUTUAL, IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.
YOU ARE FIFTEEN AND THAT IS TOO OLD FOR SPANKING IN MY OPINION.
THEY WANT TO IMPRESS THEM.
DO NOT GIVE HER TOO MUCH SPACE, OR IT WILL TURN UP BAD.
Do you have any details about her?
It's a wonderful thing, provided it is respectful and mutual.
I think 15 is a bit too old for spanking.
Because they think it's impressive.
Since he responded by saying no, he lacks instincts of women.
There is a saying- "You never forget your first love."
We did not succeed.
Therefore I said that we should just remain friends.
Explain to him that you did not mean to appear forward, but just wanted to say hello.
Did she give you something?
Explain to me men's reasons for doing that.
It would seem that men get found out more often.
However, it is a unique thought.
I must inform you that calla lillies are very good and are available in a myriad of colors.
DID SHE GIVE YOU ANYTHING?
TELL ME WHY MEN DO THAT?
I GUESS MEN JUST GET CAUGHT DOING THAT MORE.
IT IS A UNIQUE THOUGHT.

Porn is a creative activity- writing, picture, films, etc.
We are just waiting for the catch.
I have the same problem!
He has been a disrespectful bastard that likes to get smacked in the face.
I feel you need to move on and still remember your kid.
You should not have premarital sex if it is against your religious beliefs.
Yes. Make it a coupon for oral sex, or something similar.
Love happens sometimes when you weren't thinking about it.
If not, there are plenty of other people to choose from to have a relationship with.
Preferably someone who is not afraid to show emotion.
I doubt the relationships last long with a bad boy image that some girls like.
I am not that kind of guy and I think that guys are cowards.
You are too young to date or be in love.
They might be feeling the same way and want more as well.
I hope you find the right one.
Dress really sexy before he goes out, so that he can not go out with the boys.
How does this make you feel?
It had been 37 years now and well, whatever.
It seems hard if she fell in love.
You are not engaged yet, so there is no reason to worry as of yet.
It is wrong to cheat.
There are two ways of cheating in modern day.
Try to get a girl then take her picture.
If you want to have sex with him too, then talk to him all you want.
If you want extravagant, then it will cost $20,000.
I would ask the people you care about whether or not they felt cheated on.
If you are meant to be together reducing your stress will help to get her.
I send my best wishes and please forgive me; my comments were not meant to hurt the lay person.
I believe that all males only need physical love.
In my opinion, he is not a man if he waits until you are married.
Should I consider getting married in another location?
If you do not wish to be cheated on, you want to make sure you don't cheat yourself.
Someone recommended that I do it myself and that it should only take three seconds.
If you try to kiss her and she does not pull away, she wants you to kiss her.
The probability of cheating increases if the person owns a cellular telephone.
That would depend on how tight it is.
What amount you spend depends on other things.
Now everyone is happy except him.
I would say, is it in yet?
Would you not have what is considered grounds for a divorce?
Is it that you want to be the female version of 'The One?'
Wait untill you get to know him better before you tell him about the kids.
Just do not get them mad by getting them drunk.
Is there a heart to listen to or is it just teenage puppy love.
If someone did it to you and you did not like it, then why ruin someone elses marraige?
My former girlfriend and her sister are very beautiful women.
I recommend that you purchase a bass boat instead so that you can fish next summer.
Use any technique you have to get him to ask the other woman to leave.
If his behavior does not change, I recommend that you call the police.
When I date a guy I like to kiss and then I am open to going further with him.
It takes two people to love.
Be careful not to be caught by security.
Ask him to choose between you and her.
I think he likes me because he flirts with me and holds my hand.
You should try dating.  And remember that it is always better to take it slow and be on your best behavior.
In the end both of you will be happy.
Do you want your family and friends to attend?
Whether or not you are with this young lady, he is going to be upset.
Don't fear the unknown.  Give it your best shot!
Not only is he poor but he also displays a bad attitude in life.
In addition, you married him, and you were the one who proposed.
I call her Baby or Hunni. She calls me: Pooh Bear, Boo Boo, her slave, etc.
If you love her, then I would advise you go for it.
Try making an advance. If she does not resist, then you have consent.
You need to stop and really think about if you truly love him.
If that is not an option, there are other sources available.
It relys on what he is lieing about.
That would depend on what you are talking about; days, years, do you love her; if yes, then, why not?
Let her know that you think about her.
I have found a woman that I love; I love her for who she is.
It is a small gesture but it means a lot!
What are some things I can do to get revenge against her?
Love is just something that everyone does. We get stuck falling in love.
I have a good time when I am dating him, but I quickly become bored with the relationship.
Don't try to end the relationship too quickly, but if you do and he keeps pursuing you, then you know that he cares about you!
First of all, do not marry him.
She said he is just a friend and even refers to him as her "homeboy".
They do not need an extra reason to kiss, haha! Happy Holidays!
Ask yourself: Would you want another guy to try to take YOUR girlfriend away from YOU?
She did not cherish your love as you cherished hers.
Is it to make love with somebody?
I am pretty sure they would not do that for you, due to all the pain you would be in.
They prefer them with back hair instead.
If you are ok with women liberation, girl power, and stuff like that, then yes.
YOUR GIRLFRIEND HAS NOT ACCEPTED NO.
MY BOYFRIEND WANTED TO HAVE A BABY AND BE MARRIED BUT CHANGED HIS MIND. IT IS TOO LATE.
MAYBE HE THINKS YOU CAN GET BACK TOGETHER ONE DAY.
IT PROBABLY WILL NOT FOR YOU IF RELIGION IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN ONE OF YOUR LIVES.
I THINK YOU MEAN RELATIONSHIPS FOR WOMEN THAT ARE SEXUAL, WITH THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS.
Your girlfriend did not accept it.
My boyfriend wanted to get married and have children, but he changed his mind, it is too late now.
Maybe he think that the two of you can get back together.
It probably is for you if religion is very important to one of you.
I think you mean a relationship with girls with love or sex from their partner.
I have many women calling my home all day, every day.  I ask them not to call to dissuade them from continuing.
That does not seem to be advantageous if you plan to have children.
Listing them all would result in a very long list.
Sometimes that is not always the case. And you are the best judge.
Dear Katherine, Please be careful when dealing with this person.
I think men and women cheat for various reasons.
If you are not married and really mean it, why not say it?
Your questions do not make any sence.
Go to the courthouse and ask for the paperwork. Usually it is about 200 dollars.
Do exactly what your heart is telling you.
If you did not have intercourse with him
Be brave and talk to her.
Men do not care about birthdays in the same way women do.
If he is already in love with someone else, do not pursue him.  Instead, search for another man.
A woman will stay with a man, no matter what anyone says, if she loves him.
I want a baby badly also. But why make myself miserable and poor by having one now?
Guys rarely take girls back; but girls seem to take guys back.
Make me feel happy and free!
I do nto think you ever stopped loving your ex.
It is kind of like a caveman gene.
As long as the two of you are willing to work at keeping it that way.
I think that it is a turn off because I do not like the way it feels on my face.
I have that problem but I try. It helps some.
If you are wondering why lesbians hate you, then you have already answered your own questions.
This does nothing but tempt fate.
I call her my meali'i and she calls me her po'okela.
Would you like to go to my apartment, order a pizza, and have sex?
Ask yourself: Did he have the money?
And if it does not, then be satisfied with being happy.
If you like more thing about them, then go for it.
That is cold, not giving you something for your birthday.
I will create one and give it up.
And just like that, you will have your love back.
If it works out, great; it not, no loss.
Is that because they're friends and family?
That depends on what you look like.
Most people at my school know I am gay.
Did it work, even for just a laugh? Why?
I think he finished elementary school with F's in every class!
I feel as though I should do something.
A lot of things to think about if you are looking for life!
I am seventeen and I believe she has been with me since I was eight years old.
It is illegal; the 20 year-old should be put away.
You should try it with the lights on!
Conversations among men rarely contain lies.
A majority of men become timid around women.
They are someone that I never connected with.
I hope you find this pleasing and useful. I think it is very sweet.
You deserve someone who sees the potential in you.
Show and do not tell her that you can fulfill her needs and wants.
I really couldnt tell you what it was but I know it was fun and feels good.
Do not grab her arm or step on her to be rejected.

I would like to become a master at sex. Then I would like to get married and teach my wife all I knew.
Then, they had sex, and she left him.
Dancing and movies.
Do you really think he is blowing you off?
I do not know what is wrong with him.
Some people are attracted to big girls.
You can observe the actions of someone you happen to see and like.
He is sitting behind me and answering questions right now.
Magic like that can only exist in fairy tales.
Why is it that they seem content just conversing among themselves with no need for anything else?
I come across women of this variety often.
If that is not the case it is unfortunate. However, now you know and she will be happy.
Everything considered, it is time to do something different.
Some women wonder why more men do not remain faithful.
If he loves it, then you must respect him.
Wear something flattering but not too revealing.
It is a way of showing love that is unlike any other.
I do not mean what you implied but you could go on a blind date through Yahoo or Google Personals.
I still wanted to send it to him, but I never got a response.
Pretend that she does not exist.
Try asking him for a reason.
Just go for it. Although, I think that you should start from the eighth grade and beyond.
Once there, stay in the center of the action.  Do not hide out in the kitchen.
It was a stainless steel set. This is very practical for everyday use.
Should I be honest and admit I do not want her in it?
You do not. You each need to move on.
It seems as if girls pick other girls best friends.
To begin with, many men are attracted to larger women. It comes down to personal preferences.
What he does is his thing.
I can not go back to someone like that now, can I?
He will probably cheat on you again.
Now she is talking to this new guy and I found out that is is also hanging out with him.
There is so much more that both of you have. Take the time to find it.
I do not trust these online companies that search for people.
I have been told that I should not look because she will find me.
I saw him naked with her.
Let us kiss and find out what we need to know.
When you are looking for love you never find it.
I have something private I would like to share with you.
If you need additional answers, please be sure to telephone me at 307-351-2765.
Would you be comfortable with my hugging your friends when you greet them?
If you take this opportunity right now, I believe you will achieve your goal.
You can either search the directory for her contact information or just head out to find her in person.
Continue and occupy your time better.
Additionally, next time do not be so lacking in intelligence as to say things you will later regret.
God reserves the best for last.
(Afterwards ask him if you could still discuss it in person to formalize the agreement.
That girl is my friend in some ways.
A turn off from the start is that "I love you" stuff- have confidence!
I do not think there is anything wrong as long as you love that person.
Talk to her lovingly, but do not be pushy.
Do what your heart tells you to.
I can not stop thinking about the girls that I know. Is it ok for me to have sex?
What if I am not able to have children?
Young adults lack the attention to know what they want.
Should I ask the girl at my school out on a date?
I have not planned many, however, my input is 7000-10000.
Pass to him the hints which you prefer.
Merry Christmas! This gift comes from my heart. I hope she will always love it.
If your love for this gentleman is strong, then the situation is moot.
You will understand your feelings when you have matured,
Affirmative, the gentleman has entered into an adulterous affair.
I am familair with the subject matter on which I am speaking.
Tell him, then start making a list.
No, but I would be-friend them.
And that your friends are only friends.
I do not like short hair for girls.
The hand belonging to you, or your sock?
Why are men unable to remain in their homes while watching sports on television without their friends?
I do not believe men should ever strike women.
Why not remain at home and speak?
If you hurt someone like that then you do not love them.
It is as if you can not tell your girlfriend/wife about it.
Not all girls like rich boys; some like fat boys. I hate the rich type personally.
There are websites for that with plenty of single women.
Who knows, he might be doing something nice for you?
For success in life do your school work.
Some find shy girls attractive when they imitate a blush with red powder.
There is not need to get upset.
Do you plan on meeting?
The words are differentiated by the words note and word.
Come on, everybody has at least once insane one.
And make it very clear that is what you want once you have him hooked.
It is not that guys do not want to help.
Let him know what you feel.
Chance are he will be back.
The wallet is not necessary, but preferential.
Speaking to yourself seems peculiar, but it does assist.
Bring the children with your spouse.
Is there anything else?
I am aware that you would not like to pay.
Am I the only one that can do this?
When I stop talking and then do it in front of him loudly, he gets the message.
That is not bad, but pracital.
If you are too shy to flirt, do not do it.
Think of it as a breast trifecta.
Or, perhaps, it is just a thing to you.
Women do not want a man that can be easily ran over.
I am thick and I have never had a problem.
Boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but your true friends will always be there for you.
You have a lot of growing to do; 23 is very young.
You cannot go wrong with a single rose.
Did you have intercourse with the man or not?
My parents do not care for it; my mother says, "Well, if they make you happy." All while my dad despises it.
Now, I have a man who I am courting that would never fathom to think of another woman.
Realize the truth of the matter.
In the recent past, I would have responded like you.
Share this with your girlfriend, and I predict she will agree.
Would that not mean things like trust, care, and respect for someone?
He is a past romantic partner because he belongs in the past.
What if I were to cheat on my boyfriend since we do not have any relations?
He may have feelings for you but has reasons for holding back
I hope you found that useful. Be sure to treat her to a memorable time.
Those who do not have missed a great opportunity.
It is primarily him.
If you are asking that question, then I cannot respect you.
Because, they may not like you, and wouldn't want you to know things.
Does anyone know what I should do?
They also do not like men of other races or color, but, do you know what?
People at school think that I am nerd.
Second of all, none of my lesbian friends do not hate me; they do not find men attractive.
Until one comes along and they start begging and pleading.
If you do not feel hurt, that just proves that you do not care about him or her.
Tell him that you do not want him to do that any longer.
Is this the kind of relationship you want from a partner?
No, as long as they have an orgasm, weight doesn't matter.
You don't have to move to Africa.
Choose one to pick up and try.
I really like him. He asked me out last year. Before we did anything, I told him no.
Raising kids as gay is immoral.
Good luck with the boyfriend and Happy Holidays!
Why not? He might just be Mr. Right.
Why bother in the first place?
I guess the only concolation to that situation is honesty.
I know that is how my friends are, but do not lie, I am already good.
Us women are not so complex creatures.
If he says no and you believe him, there you go.
How can I forget it in my mind?
Why not just ask her adn go from there?
Sounds like an excuse, but you can always kick the kids out sometime.
She will love a nice, simple gift received from you.
If your love is causing emotional pain you must end the relationship.
Repeat this sentiment: "We men are insecure."
Do not dwell on the relationship as she would have found you if she so desired.
You must simply be charming and sweet as girls enjoy these characteristics.
He will tell her what you said if they are just friends.
If it is his, he will know.
First, consider getting a dictionary. So that way you are able to spell the work anniversary.
What is so funny; he is only 20 years old.
A guy who really cares for you will make the time to call and say hello.
Do you forgive him and stay, or do you figure it as a love-crime and leave?
Try writing it better.
He just wants to use you anytime.
I like to think they will understand and protect you.
Please take the right step and do some deep thinking before making any decision.
Did you not promice to love, honor, etc?
If you do not mean it, do not say it.
Tell me how things go.
If you have to ask, he probably is.
There is nothing wrong with flirting with a guy.
I did not like kissing or having sex with men.
I am a guy and I really enjoy limerick poems.
I pick it up and stare at it.
Then, even if she has a drink already, hand her another one.
Never go to a movie on a first date.
(That is even more modern thinking.)
Let her know that you would rather leave than cheat because that is how much you care about her.
One day they want you to give them space and the next day they want a relationship!
To identify it would be a completely different task.
I would prefer to have no contact with her is she cannot be around weapons.
Before the words "I love you" can be spoken it has to be felt.
Do not be hasty to quit as these things tend to take time. If you are interested in them try it again.
Take your pick from a neighbor's house to enjoy a holiday with her.
Most women prefer it to be just them two.
Do not waste your life over one girl.
I would date them both.
First of all, what kind of guy says he would never ---- as you put it in?
Smile please and think about it.
Look around, take what you want and have a good time.
You are going to end up with one thousand cats and rats if you do not stop.
It is because they think that there is something that they are missing.
You do need to love getting older.
You deserve someone who will only look at and want you.
If not, you should probably talk to a grandparent or close friend.
I would like to be your friend.
Now I'm with a girl I totally trust; she and I are both very happy.
Do not give away that you are interested in him.
Try giving him a test first, and then you can more easily make the decision on whether to end things.
Do not give into pressure to do things you would rather not do.
I would be willing to date someone of a different race. All people need love.
I would like a woman who is fat, hairy, obese, and belittles me in public.
Do you hang out with your friends?
The question should be, "Am I in love with him?" not "Do I love him?"
Do the household chores she hates the most!
Do not let him and he will not.
Say, "Hey momacta, let me hit that!"
You probably have not been looking in the right places but do not worry, there is someone for everyone.
Take what you will from it.
You may not realize, but men are just as confusing as women.
Until then, hang in there.
This is just something your mind has made up.
Dating the sibling of an ex-partner is never a good idea.
That would be dependent on whether she likes you too.
If you are both agreeable to having religious differences, then there is no reason not to marry.
I would recommend EE Cummings. There is plenty of poetry men enjoy.
I am not this way, but my husband is.
Some men are just stupid like that.
It is doable.
If I was her, I would want to go to a movie and then go out to eat.
Just spend some time hanging out.
Accept and be friends with him.
He tends to purchase items which he desires, so he has no need for anything.
I dislike him. He is not good for you, you can do better than that.
Yes, do what you want, it is your life.
It is alright to be afraid, but do not allow that to stop you.
TRY TO ACCEPT HIM AND JUST BE FRIENDS.
HE USUALLY BUYS THINGS IF HE WANTS THEM, SO HE MAY NOT NEED ANYTHING.
I DO NOT LIKE HIM, HE IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU, YOU CAN DO BETTER.
DO WHAT YOU WANT IT IS YOUR LIFE.
IT IS OK TO BE AFRAID BUT DO NOT LET THAT STOP YOU.
It all depends if you love him or not.
Now think, whether it could happen with your ex or not.
Be a friend and dont let your feeling for her get you further away from your goal.
Feed that person. That should keep them quiet for awhile.
That should shut them up.
I love sleeping with my wife.
It is possible if you have to ask yourself that question.
I love him so much I don't want our relationship to end.
There is nothing wrong with having sex after marriage.
They had previously had it with someone else.
Just remember, it does matter.
Tell me if you found an answer.
I think that age is nothing but a number.
As for me, I am not sure if I want to get married any time soon; I am young with little experience.
I have a feeling she is seeing another man but, I am not sure.
This is just my opinion.
Therefore, every night he has to lie in the bed where his girlfriend and best friend made love together.
I want to see what keeps her motivated everyday.
Before you confess your attraction to them, give them a hint or flirt a bit.
You are not a terrible person just because you have needs.
I wish I was that lucky!
You need to set a budget.
It is a good thing I like the Twilight Zone music.
He is not worth it.
Se said you are all about spending money when I told him about movies, carnivals, eating out, and a concert.
And he will not already have a wife, correct?
Unintelligent person, that was an unintelligent question!
Due to the fact that men tell lies simply for the sake of thinking they can do so with no repercussions.
The best suggestion is to not ask men out on dates.
I do not believe that it is a true statement that lesbians hate men.
I concur, there's good and bad... just familiarize yourself with them.
This is a simplified overview of a more detailed whole.
If you're not sure how to operate it, hand it to me.
A friend of mine would like to know.
I'm in one at the moment, and I love it.
If you simply want to play but are not the serious type then tell her that as well.
Then I became a bit less aggressive.
No, that is very attractive. What has been happening, darling?
A person has only one soul mate and true love.
Coincidentally, my boyfriend and and I will meet you there because we are getting married as well.
Just tell him or her how you feel honestly or don't let him or her near you anymore.
There is no one good enough for a truly nice guy.
Choose pink. Feminine girls love pink and butterflies.
Sue her for libel.
I think you got the question wrong.
WHAT ARE YOU SPEAKING OF?
WE ARE NOT THE SAME EVEN AS A FEW GENERATIONS BACK.
DO NOT WASTE TONS OF TIME DOING SO.
COMMUNICATE WITH HER AND IF SHE LOVES YOU, SHE WILL BRUSH THIS MAN OFF.
THEY ARE FROM TWO DIFFERENT PLANETS.
what in the world are you referring to
our generation is not alike from the older generation
do not lose alot of time completing this
maintain proper communication with her and she will no longer be interested in another
reason is that they are from two different planets!
If I hurt my best friend I would admit and offer an apology.
What is playing at the Fox Theater on New Years Day 2006?
I would follow her suggestion and just be friends moving forward.
If you are interested in the gentleman you should ask him out on a date.
You risk losing both if you do not follow through.
You should buy her underwear.
When I am asked why I do not get married, I just say, "what for"?
That is too bad you do not have an Avatar.
If he believes you are cheating, break up with him.
Do not worry, there are people who never cheat.
NO OFFENSE BUT SHE DOES NOT SOUND VERY INTERESTING.
THERE IS ALSO THIS THAT MEN DO NOT LIKE UNKEPT WOMEN.
I HOPE KAELY LYKINS LOVES ME AS I LOVE HER.
YES I HAVE TWO GIRLFRIENDS AND WE ARE CLOSE.
No offense, but she does not sound very interested.
There is also this statement:  guys do not like bushy privates.
Like the mouth, or just the lips, or just the tongue, etc.
I will Kaely Lykins likes me!
Yes, because I have two girlfriends and we are very close.
It depends on how she feels; if she has stayed for that long, I bet it is good to get married.
Have fun but do not date again untill you are sure you can not get him back.
It is a guy thing, do not fall into that trap- take control and you call the shots.
If they are single they probably want to stay that way.
I do not understand why some girls like those guys at all.
Some things you could do would be to get a new young canine companion, or watch movies like the American Pie movies.
My advice would be to flirt with him and ask him if he was looking at you.
However, my friend, if you were caught playing around, it could get messy.
(That is how I would describe the sound.)
Therefore, why should we just love one person?
Try to get everyone concerned to care.
I cannot tell you anything because I do not have a boyfriend.
But they were still going out secretly and I did not know.
Please leave comments as this was my most embarrassing moment.
If that does not work, then just ask her about it.
There is no price on love.
We danced together and kissed; we did not talk much but we feel as though we have talked so much already.
Why so quick to end another marriage?
A kiss is something else I would add.
After the date is set, you can move on from there.
SHE IS A SICK WOMAN AND SHAME ON HER.
I HOPE THAT ONE DAY THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO ASK A QUESTION LIKE THAT.
HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT?
NO, HE SHOULD BREAK UP WITH YOU FOR BEING SHALLOW.
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I GET SO TIRED OF ASKING AND I GET ANNOYED.
She is a disgusting woman, and she should be ashamed of herself.
My hope is that one day, this is a question that no one will have to ask.
I am very surprised you were not already aware of that.
Certainly not. He should end his relationship with you, since you are so shallow.
I become annoyed because I am tired of having to ask about certain things so very often.
I do not think all mean cheat.
Take an ice cube, crush it with your feet, and say "now I have broken the ice."
If he is cheating on you with other girls, tell him that the problem is and leave.
I think that you could go to the movies.
Go out and buy somethign sexy to wear, even if it is just around the house.
So explain if you want advice, please. ;)
If you would not marry them, do not date them.
Because it is very easy to say, but difficult to say in words.
So there is only the girl who wants things differently.
Yeah, love can be at first sight.
If it were up to me, you would be packing your bags and hitting the road.
How are you treating and trusting your girlfriend?
You call her, but she does not answer the phone.
If he did not find women attractive, he would not have much interest in you!
Guess what? I have lost my incentive to do these things.
It is also about playing with gadgets.
Do not act like a stereotypical floozy.
You should determine how much money you will have.
If they say no, that is the final answer.
I have a friend whose father passed away last year. In that situation, you must first calm down.
Nothing can get a girl going like horsepower. At least it works for me!
Who don't women like short guys over tall ones?
I do not know what to do.
It is online dating, not line dating.
If a casual friend is asking, they are just making conversation.
If she is willing to go this far what will she be willing to do next?
Yes, and there isn't anything there. It is only an empty space between your ears.
It does not take much to arouse a male. We are always ready to be aroused.
I think that the point of the drug is just that; to stay erect and to have endurance.
I know of many people who use it, and at least some of them are looking for relationships.
Do not let your relationship go bad.
The reason is, I can see myself in them.
It means they do not want to hurt your feelings, because you obviously care more than they do.
You see, I do believe in love at first sight, though, it happens rarely.
He would not like it if you gawked at other men; tell him that and attempt to work it out.
If they ask, I would say Oh, you!"
If you have crushes on guys and can not imagine being with a girl, that is gay.
She should just leave and not mess around on you.
If you like this guy you should go out with him.
Stop sweating and start laughing, because I can be funny at times.
Sweet talk and have some drinks with them.
I knew I liked women from a young age.
Don't try to ruin someone else's life for you own gain.
The same situation happened to me, he cheated on my with my best friend.
I would really like some advice.
JUST USE SWEET TALK AND GET THEM DRUNK.
I KNEW I LVOED WOMEN AT A YOUNG AGE.
DO NOT RUIN SOMEONE'S LIFE FOR YOUR OWN GAIN.
THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME, HE WAS UNFAITHFUL TO ME WITH MY BEST FRIEND.
I COULD USE SOME ADVISE.
Make yourself look good but still dress conservativly.
How can emotions create pain?
It is because they watch too much MTV.
He should trust you enough that you love only him.
Can you send me your answers to my email- timitimika@yahoo.com?
I have found that Yahoo personals and the site match.com work well.
I am interested in finding full figure women and attractive women with wonderful personalities.
Sometimes you can love one person and love another equally.
Sometimes people do not have good morals, but there are still people out there who do have good morals.
It is up to the both of you, if that is something that works for you two, than it is fine.
If you have to take a break so he can go on with you life, then do just that.
She obviously does not care if you get sick or not.
Just because she asked for the moon does not mean she will get it.
When I was first married, I was almost 31.
Being a virgin is not as bad as many people think it is.
to be cheap linens and things have great gifts!
i call this a dumb ass!!
Once a cheater always a cheater
when she is home she doesnt really hang out with family
it is in the blood it will happen
Remain vigilant if you find it hard to distance yourself from someone.
Oh, dear! You kiss in the same way as your mother.
If the man is a good person, he'll accept your children as well as yourself.
My younger brother has just turned 21, so I hope this has been helpful.
No, I think you just need a new beau.
I believe in lust and yearning at first sight.
What is there to not like about him?
If you two hang out after that, it means he likes you.
Internet, street corners, house of ill repute, high school/college, mall.
Go to a sports bar during any major event.
Never give appearances of being nice just to try and win her affections again.
Not only is it all right, it is also recommended.
My personal feeling is that my man treats me bad, and it needs to stop.
Of course. If you are in a relationship, why shouldn't you?
They are simply toys. You can play with them on your own.
That is what it is like to be in love.
You are considered bisexual if you have a sexual desire for both males and females.
I think that pythons are gross and the girl is not in her right mind for letting it go.
It depends on what the kiss is like.
If you are too much of a gentleman, she may feel you aren't interested.
Do not give up hope, she will be there.
It becomes a part of you. So when it is taken away, it truly hurts.
Choose the food and flowers that you want. It's your day. Do not concern yourself with what other people think.
Who cares about what they are doing?
Maybe, do you own a toothbrush?
It seems that online, you all have good chemistry.
West Coast Swing is my favorite.
Open your eyes and heart he may be there already; if you have faith.
Is it asking too much to seek a woman who is around 38, educated, honest, attractive, interested in serious men, and faithful?
You need to put your foot down and be firm about not accepting that kind of behavior.
There are some mind games centering around pipe dreams.
If you have any advice for improvement, please inform me.
Would that not also mean some men are promiscuous?
It feels like he is flirting.
Please help me tell my mom that I want to go out with him.
Open your eyes and you see a beautiful world is out there for you.
Get over her. Sorry, but you can not make someone love you.
It had to have dropped by at least 50 points.
If you want to get back together with him, you should try to call him on the phone.
You should take a trip to Australia.
I think your name says it all.
Please give me credit for trying. I did my best.
I know someone who enjoys making other people cry.
They are out there, just have to find them, just like I am wondering where all the faithful men are at?
Sometimes you have to be a jerk in life to get what you want.
It came with a price, my broken heart!
I used to be that way because I did not trust my partner.
Sit down and have a nice heart to heart.
What do women really want in a man?
If that seems too impersonal, then ask.
You can search for everything you need to know when you click on the below links.
I was there a year ago, but I live in Brazil and that is a fun place too!
She has hand bags, cosmetics, shoes, or anything else that she has been dreaming about.
There are many men out there who are wonderful.
This moment in time is not yours, someday you will have your time to shine.
Sometimes we have love, but we do not accept the love that we have.
You should have your family help you and look for you.
You only live once, having regrets and being upset is time lost.
If he has a nice smile, I cannot resist the urge to gaze at it.
I prefer big beautiful women over skinny girls.
It is how you use it and not how big it is.
Eventually, your dad will get over it.
Tell him that he is a disgrace to men.
MEND DO THAT ALL THE TIME, MY FRIEND.
OTHER MEN DO NOT LOOK GOOD NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO TO THEIR HAIR.
I AM GUESSING YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE TOO WILD.
THAT IS JUST MY IDEAS.
HOW DO YOU WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE? IF YOU DO, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ASK.
Men do it all the time, girl.
Other men, well, they just do not look good no matter what they do to their hair!
But I assume you mean that you do not want to get too wild.
But that is just my two cents!
How do you really know when you love someone?
If you know the girl you could ask any questions you like.
You have to love and respect the person you are going to make love to.
Nothing is wrong with shaving, but the snake thing has to hurt!
Also, sex is not always penetration.
Doing it sideways is also good because the penis really gets in there.
Anywhere, you do not have to specify that you are a Xtian.
Just have to love all those walking contradictions out there.
We are best friends and love every minute that we spend together.
Hey, did you not know? A man grades his manhood according to the number of girls he has conquered.
You deserve better, do you not think so?
It is all about who you fall in love with.
There are many ways to find out, but the easiest is to ask her.
I would suggest you give her a rose, some chocolates, and tell her how much you love her.
You can let him talk to you when you are in the mood.
I enjoy doing that, too, and I do not feel it is wrong.  I feel it is very sexy and a turn-on.
Just be best friends with her father.
if she is truly using him he'll find it out if you give it time.
It is a hard thing to do but if you love the person then it is so worth it.
Tell your new girls about her before anything goes beyond a first date.
So just take this advice, that at least one of you should use a condom.
You said that you are shy. You should use that trait to your advantage.
Would he not get mad at you?
Do this out in a nice, public restaurant. Do not become desperate ever.
How rude. Buy him cheap socks and underwear.
If you are not ready, then do not do it, even if that means ending the relationship.
Nothing, he was there before you and he will be there after you.
I have never in my life felt the way I do now.
Make you stronger, or destroy you?
My ex had very crooked teeth, but I was him that I liked so the teeth did not bother me.
Go on, you know that you want to.
Plus, he may be doing the blushing.
Then, you can go for it.
They say it, but they don't mean it.
Geocities through Yahoo lets you, or used to let you make a website for free.
What kind of sick lover do you have?
Moreover, she will not discontinue her advances toward me.
If you are not sincere in your actions we will be able to tell.
You can meet women in many places, such as online dating sites, personal ads, church, libraries, bookstores, coffee shops, concerts, gyms or supermarkets.
One sure sign of lying is when a person fidgets or looks down or away.
If you love him you will learn to deal with him.
What might work is calling her to talk about your day.
That means it is very important for you to be comfortable with yourself.
No, I think that love died with the souls of the meek.
Saying you made a mistake is not an excuse.
Just approach them, because we are nice when you treat us correctly!
I am a shy guy too and noisy rooms do not help when you are trying to socialize.
Ignorance is bliss if you really want to be happy.
If you are worried about hurting their feelings by not saying it, then you care, so tell them that.
If you like her then, yes.
Ask him to do something sometime, if he likes you he will say yes.
That would be dependent on the two of you.
It may not always work, but you have to deal with both the negative and positive aspects.
P.S. I am a single, normal looking guy.
By being honest with both of them, you all get to make a choice.
While it is not disgusting, it is very messy.
It depends on both of you!
This will not always work, but you have to take the good with the bad.
P.S., I'm a single, normal looking guy.
If you tell both of them about the other, all of you have choices, don't you?
It's not nasty, but it can be messy!
This is without a doubt the most ridiculous thing I've ever posted.
You may also want to get to know him on a personal level.
It is messy, and it's possible she could contract a terrible infection from it.
Just smile, and do not do anything you will regret.
In my experience, there are also a lot of unattractive and cruel homosexual men as well.
I do like her a lot, so what should I do?
Tell him that you like him.
Ignore people who only want to have sex with you.
Because that is what it is.

Because, the left hand goes to your heart.
Then, make love, and once more say, "I love you."
Love always hurts, and it never makes itself easy to understand!
Because, many guys don't have feelings to cover up?
Get one good looking one, and you'll be rolling in phone numbers.
Because they have figured out how easy we are.
I do not do much making eye contact or simply flirting.
No, what if she finds out that you are cheating?
Guys try to be like their fathers.
Because a real man does not need sex; he need a friend.
They never will until they lose you.
You can always try again once you decide he is done with his games.
Tell her you already have a girlfriend.
There is not anything we do for fun.
I guess you have your answer.
I didn't choose not to be gay, I am not, and I would not want to be.
I agree, he is too old for you.
It sounds like you are thinking with your libido.
If that is difficult, go and return to him later.
Begin with, "How was your day at work?"

How can I add people I meet in Yahoo to my Yahoo buddy list?

I have large breast and have seen the upside.

I AM UNSURE ABOUT IT, BUT MINE WAS LOST WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD.
IT SOUNDS AS IF YOU COULD USE SOME COMPANY.
WHERE DO YOU LIVE AND WHAT IS YOUR AGE?
I WOULD ADVISE YOU SIMPLY BE YOURSELF, NOT ASK THE INTERNET FOR THEIR OPINIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
IF YOU ARE THE ONE WHO ASKS HIM OUT, YOU WILL BE PAYING FOR YOUR OWN DATE.
I'm not sure. Truthfully, I lost mine when I was ten.
It seems to me that you are extremely lonely.
How old are you? Where do you live?
First of all, by not seeking answers and advice from the internet at two a.m. Secondly, just act like yourself.
And remember, if you ask him out, you should then pay for the date.
If you love her, she'll love you back.
I've been more busy at work lately,and I'm enjoying life.
When she stated that you have changed, what did she mean?
As difficult as it can be, give her another opportunity. Attempt to work things out for one last time.
If you go to Yahoo Personals, it will tell you.
Why would she want to be with someone so boring?

It depends, it would be earlier if their parents won't disown them for it.
SHE IS THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS, THE WOMAN I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO SPEND MY TIME WITH.

I AM NOT POSITIVE, BUT DUE TO IT BEING ILLEGAL, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY YES.
IF HE IS A TRUE GENTLEMEN, HE WOULD MAKE SURE THE WOMAN WENT FIRST.
IT ISN'T FOR CERTAIN, IT DOES DEPEND ON HOW THEIR PARENTS FEEL ABOUT IT.
White with the bow already on top would cost approximately 10 to 15 dollars.

A man could give me flowers and that would mean more to me than giving me a ring would any day.
That is too manly, but only because some men try to conform.
But it sounds like it is better to move forward.
14 or 15 or above is best.
I'm just wondering if he falls for it.
The attractive man is quite rude when he is into you.
Where should I go to get to know him.
Do you have any suggestions on gifts that might be suitable for her?
I consider age to be just a number unless the person is under-age and therefore it is a crime.
I happen to be working on the same problem.
What should I discuss with them - the weather?
The first step is to let her know that you like her and await a response.
I know from experience that sometimes men do not know a good thing until it is gone.
That, and getting on with your life...
Mine did it behind my back a lot... it just started a lot of fights.
I told her that I didn't approve of it, so she said she didn't want to see me anymore.
Somehow, though, they always end up thinking you really like them.
FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE, MEN ARE UNAWARE THEY HAVE SOMETHING WORTH KEEPING UNTIL THEY HAVE LOST IT.
WHILE THAT IS IMPORTANT, SO IS GETTING ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
MINE OFTEN DID THIS WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE, IT CAUSED MUCH CONFLICT.
I INFORMED HER THAT I DIDN'T APPROVE OF IT, AND SHE INFORMED ME THAT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS ENDING.
IT ALWAYS ENDS THE SAME, WITH THEM BELIEVING YOU REALLY LIKE THEM.

While he goes out with his friends, she stays home instead of seeing hers.
What is she doing?
She may be speechless but she will say yes.

She called to say she misses you?
Masturbation is a form of sex with someone that I love.

It is not worth the risk of getting an STD, AIDS or pregnant.
They are the same age but they are not close.
Hello, again.  Please wear less clothing.
As with other girls, she is stupid.

I mean that's virtually up to you to decifer. And, your parents.
Try going to the local church.
You should stay true to your current boyfriend.
It would be great to see what is attractive to these women.

You need to punch him in the face.
Most likely because they don't want a relationship.
I had the same thought but don't believe that Spring PCS is capable of doing that.
I feel normal and believe that it's okay that I am gay.
I hate them and wish they had all perished.

Which do you think is worse?
In addition, the first one is going to be the fastest.

I BELIEVE THAT WOMEN FIND SHY MEN ATTRACTIVE.

RELIGION HAS CAUSED MORE FIGHTING AND KILLING THROUGHOUT HISTORY.
IF IT IS FOR MY FAMILY, I CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.

You've been speaking on the phone for quite a while now.
I believe that someone can help.
If I understand correctly, if you're great at sex, you can't be trusted?
What should I do so that I can have his attention?
I am having sex with a thirty to thirty-eight year old attractive mother.
Anyway, I hope that things will go well for you.
My advice is that she is going to say no, or she is only trying to get you wrapped up.
I prefer my woman to be nice in the real world, but exceptional in bed.
The decision is mostly up to your parents.
You must trust and respect her.
Men don't typically care.

1. What do you look for in a relationship?
Maybe you need to spice it up.
I know from experience that I become stupid when I talk with girls I like.

Is it only me, or is her answer telling you that it is alright?
Remember what is good about you; Keep yourself busy and give yourself time and stay strong.
It is both a film and a story.

I am sorry, but they are all homosexual.
Women do not want to die, but men only care about having sex.
Well she did, which is not my problem because he does not like her anymore.
It does not matter if you are homosexual, just as long as you have someone to love and someone that loves you.
Yes sir, you are mistaken.
Someone persistently asking you to have intercourse with them is not a vaild reason to do so, especially if you are in a committed relationship.
I am apprehensive about this type of relationship because you need to meet someone to truly know who they are.
Ask him what kind of things he enjoys doing and pick something together that you both would enjoy.
Boy, boy, or girl, girl, whatever. Just someone to love, and to love you and "circle the wagons" with.
Yes sir, your're barking on the wrong tree.

Begin slowly and passionately, then do it hard but gently.
Couple's Therapy, though it sounds strange, it does help.
DURING TEENAGE YEARS, MEN BELIEVE THEY ARE BAD BOYS FOR HAVING SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE.
THEY SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IS IN THEIR NATURE.
IF IT TURNS OUT TO NOT BE TRUE, THEN YOU HAVE WASTED NOTHING BUT A BIT OF TIME.
THE FIRST TIME SHOULD BE SLOW AND FULL OF PASSION, FOLLOW THAT UP WITH SOMETHING A BIT MORE ACTIVE BUT STILL CAREFUL.

HOW CAN I ASK OUT A WOMAN I WORK WITH?
KEEP ME INFORMED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS.
WHILE NOT ALL MEN ARE THE SAME, SOME DO REQUIRE IT.
YOU SHOULD INFORM THE PROPER AUTHORITIES BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.
I WENT THROUGH THE SAME THING WITH MY WIFE, HE WON'T CHANGE.
Heck, I like a guy with good teeth.
Just don't go solo, it makes the girls mad.
Why would he stay in just because you got mad?
I did, and I've been deliriously happy for over five years now. Just follow your heart.
I married someone I met online.
Goodness, I like a guy that has nice teeth.
Please do not go by yourself, as it upsets the grrrs.
Then why would he stay home because you were angry?
I did and I have been deliriously happy for more than five years.  Simply follow your heart.
I married a person I met online.
Most likely you're attracted to your choir director.

Think about of having a child of your own one day.

Josie, no matter how hard you try to make things right, he will never change; my boyfriend is just as difficult.
HIGH SCHOOL IS A CONFUSING TIME, OFTEN TIMES STUDENTS ARE CRUEL TO EACH OTHER.

YOU SHOULD FOLLOW WHAT YOUR HEART SAYS.
JOSIE, I EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING IN A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP, HE WILL NEVER CHANGE.
Sometimes women act loud, to get attention from the male they're attracted to.
I believe with homosexual sex, it wouldn't work.

That was the ex girlfriend I found in bed with another woman.
It depends upon the character of the girl.
In my opinion, my friend has a horrible boyfriend.
That should not stop you from enjoying it.

Life is what you make of it, regardless of age.
The only thing cheating solves is lust, temporarily.
Its time could come any moment, so I am waiting.
Take a break from both of them; who will you miss more?
I don't think of anyone else when I am out with my date.
I suppose I could be falsifying it.
I am not convinced you are in love with either of them.
You should trust your intuition.  It is obvious that you are having second thoughts.
It is too bad that he is not considerate and respectful of that matter.
You get a feeling in your heart.
Converse and discuss problems with your significant male other about every thing.
Responses from females and women would be beneficial.
IF YOU ARE HAVING DOUBTS, YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM.
IF HE CANNOT FIND A WAY TO RESPECT THE WISHES, THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM.
YOU WILL FEEL IT WITH YOUR HEART.
YOU SHOULD COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR PARTNER ABOUT EVERYTHING.
INPUT FROM WOMEN WOULD BE HELPFUL.

EITHER WAY, I WISH YOU ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD.
i WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT BOTH ARE IMPORTANT, WOMEN LIKE TO BE HAPPY AND THE SIZE IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT.

What does not kill you make you stronger.
Best of luck to you.
Silence does not always indicated that the person is bored.
That does not mean I can say what is going on with your husband.

Here is a clue about what your next step needs to be!
That is not true if you really love him.
I am heterosexual but some of my friends are not.

Start by telling her your name and letting her know that you think she is lovely.
Yes, he is far too old for you.
I feel it is to everyone's own preference.
I AM HETEROSEXUAL BUT I DO HAVE HOMOSEXUAL FRIENDS.
CURRENTLY, I A DO NOT WANT ANY CHILDREN.

Wait for the guy.
I am going to be honest and forthright.
It seems like neither you nor your partner are quite ready for marriage yet.
If you question him about his behavior, he may not even realize there is something inappropriate about it.
I would do so, because this might halt his undesirable behavior.
My grandfather was the last good man I knew.
I don't understand what you meant by, "Will I get him?".
It doesn't mean it will be easy.
Question him about his objectives.

It is all about the mind, and if you do not connect that way first then all you are having is sex.

What makes them unique is their tactics.
Act properly, enjoy the moment.
You might have already tried, but Switchboard.com has worked for myself in the past.
Say hello, then introduce yourself, then attempt to make conversation.
Just be yourself. The first thing that you need to realize is that you are a special person.
Okay, well a good thing to do to turn him on is to rub his ear.
In my opinion, if you are attracted to her, then try to get her attention.
It is obvious that he only wants to have sexual relations with you.
I do not at all the majority of the time.
Not all guys are only after having sex; there are some really nice men as well.
I only want to be friends with you, and nothing more than that.
So if that is what you prefer then you should do that.
Basically, one way to tell is if you are flirting with this guy and do not realize it.
Some women do, and some men enjoy it, as well.
Well married women should not have a boyfriend's body to make remarks about.
IN THE FUTURE, HE MAY SHOW SIGNS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE.
ONE SURE CLUE IS WHEN YOU DISCOVER YOU HAVE BEEN FLIRTING WITH A MAN AND YOU WEREN'T EVEN AWARE YOU WERE DOING IT.
WOMEN OFTEN DO, AND SOMETIMES MEN ENJOY IT AS WELL.
IF A WOMAN IS MARRIED, SHE SHOULD NOT MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT A BOYFRIENDS BODY.

Don't make any plans, just be punctual on the wedding day. Best of luck to you!
Don't let other people determine who you friends are, or aren't.
This is not having sex, but your boyfriend may enjoy it enough to stay.
And how can one be obtained?
Because they want their date to get to know their siblings.

No, because once you get married, you do not have sex anymore.
You must do what feels right to you.
It will probably ruin your friendship, but at least she is experienced.
I would like some thoughts on how best to propose to her.
Since I am a lesbian, I often socialize with gay men. I can tell you honestly, they are not all attractive.
She should know it is seen as homosexual and annoying.
Older women prefer nice men, and younger women are drawn to obnoxious men.
Keep looking for new and interesting opportunities!
If you are considering cheating, check that you care as much as you feel you do.
Then maybe you will find a sex partner.
Do you have homosexual chat rooms for teenagers?
And do not lead her on afterward.
She is going to feel very down on her self, like a worthless thing.
I conveyed everything to her, clearly, her reply was that she would "think", on it.
This is due to the fact most people make the mistake of speaking quickly before they think, just blurting things out.
I would like to know when men will stop acting as such...
All this said, have fun looking for the right kind of woman you seek out.

It's not as if he going to leave anywhere soon.
My husband and I watch adult movies together.
Men are a bit less than respectable.
After three months, is he serious?
If you hear these unfortunate words, immediately back off.
He came and spoke to me in both of my dreams.
We sometimes do and sometimes don't have feelings for them. Most of our friends are men.
I am a man and I can say honestly that I find pornography disgusting.
I believe this is true. For me it is, and I believe it is for many women.
If you love them, then talk about it, and ask. However, don't expect too much.
Take your time and do not do the pornographic tongue flick.
He is basically saying that it is tough being me.
Perhaps your best friend found a very insecure girl hoping for a jell-o pitted cat fight!

Her sentences are starting to sound she uses the word "ahhness" as every other word she says.
Do not worry, she will understand and if she is she will open up to you.
They will follow your wife and find out if she is cheating on you or not.
Yes, if they really have true love.
Didn't I tell you I took them all and turned them into lesbians>
Yes, but it will hurt you, so pick one.
Once I knew for certain, I told him and he proposed.
If you had so much fun, I do not think he lost interest, especially since he is still calling you.
Would you say that you are still attracted to him and like him?
Keep the policy of "do not ask/do not tell".
The best thing would be to ask about what is wrong.
Perhaps what you desire most is what you do not have.
Christmas is not about giving and receiving gifts.
If that does not work then he is immature.
He wants to marry me even though he does not even notice me and I wonder why.

You need to decide who is more important. Is it your boyfriend or your friend/roommate?
Men either do or they do not.
She is not telling you something that might harm you.
One day I will leave you.
If they do not mind, why should you?
I think it is ugly and disgusting.
She did not catch it until recently because her disreputable partner has been having unprotected sex.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The best way a man invited me to go on a date was so innocent; he just asked.

The brain is a woman's most erogenous zone.
She is the only one who knows what is going on, so you need to talk to her.

Intelligence matters because laughter can only get you so far.
However, do not kill her; that is not a good idea.
Find out how old he/she is.
She acts proper, but she gives good sex.
Do you want to date this girl?

But she just broke up with me this past year, and I do not understand why.
Ask her on a date.
How do I deal with this?
By the way, I am not saying art students are not decent.
Before I was 19, I lost my virginity to my wife.
You need to ask yourself, "Can I deal with this for the rest of my life?"
Yes, it would depend on who the man and them woman are.
Do not start the conversation by saying that you want a divorce, that word can be considered to be hostile.
If one of the men did not work out for me, then I always had the other one to fall back on.
So, you need to wait on another one who has the same dream as you do.

Pay her, and then return to your home with your wife.
Does he have drool dripping out of his mouth when he stares?
A dinner at her favorite place.
Try acting like you are sexy, and then you will be sexy.

You could ask her, or catch her in the crime.
It was a very funny dream.
Perhaps he wants you to ask him on a date.
Barbie would accept it.
You can question her or wait until she breaks the law.
The dream was hilarious.
I could have gone the rest of my life without seeing her again.
I think it will work if you get him a box of condoms and say, "Let's do it sexy."

Bring a case against him in small claims court.

I hope your wife will read this online.
If she refuses to put her signature on it, then tell her to leave.
I would just break up with her because what she did was wrong.
But, does not know that I am dating someone else.
It would be better if swingers were the only one to respond to this question.
It is difficult to find the perfect person, male or female.
You have to let things go every so often.
Begging for female companions on the internet makes you look pathetic.
If you knew this man you would not let him move in with you.
Sounds to me that you are in a casual relationship.
Good looking people can have ugly personalities.
You might enjoy it as well if you give it a chance.
Do women use this to enlarge their breasts?
We are in a strong and dedicated relationship, but we participate in swinging as well.
They shot you down.
I have never kissed a man.

I can not stand to look at my reflection.
I believe you meant a long term relationship, and if so, then when your casual relationship matures into a full relationship, then you should know.
Women: Do you, or would you, and why or why not?
If she enjoyed it or wanted it as much as you do, then yes, it will only help you.
Ask him, and then come onto him first.
That is my opinion anyway.
I promise you that they are out there.
How about saying, "Hey, I need more sex!"
You have to turn them on first, then everything will be turned on.
If anything is wrong, you can always turn it into a joke.
To find out what a guy is thinking, look in his eyes to try and read them, or his heart if you know him well.
If not, then your first time should not be bad.
Best of luck, Sincerely, Ice Princess. PS:

Or just ask him to be up front with you.
There must be a reason that you broke up in the first place, right?
If she has feelings for you, then what are you waiting for?
Women do not see 38 year old me as old.
If they want to see you, then do it.
It is not a big deal.
Maybe she likes you a little too much?
It'll be difficult, but leave.
It's not a good way to find love, with other men's girlfriends.
He would call me next, and so forth.
I love him, I want to marry him. I don't want my family to disown me.
Stay off that terrible drug!
Be confident, but not self absorbed.
It sounds as if they're busy with their own lives.

The majority of us are quite similar.
Your wife will be speechless.
If you are bad at conversating then you don't have to talk much with others.
My wife did the same thing.

I have a male friend, with a girlfriend with issues.
You shouldn't force her to do anything.
We both have careers, she's in her twenties, I'm in my thirties.
If you do not look for him, he will come to you.
Do not take this literally because this is only my opinion.
Move on with your life, be friends, and do not push him for anything more serious.
Sometimes you are so big that it hurts and other times it's the opposite situation.
How it works is if you are very good looking, she will be the one to chase you.
She is probably playing hard to get.
That's because people are quite dense and in love.

If you two have been together for that period of time mother probably knows.
There are plenty of fish in the sea.
Homosexual men are similar to women, in that they both are attracted to men. No offense meant.

Hello, I am a forty-six-year-old male who is five feet and eight inches tall.
That is the most stupid question I have ever heard.
It is only because of the thinking, nothing else.
Because your friend is smarter than you.
It sounds to me like he is trying to control you bit too much.
IF you do not want to do it, then don't bother.
I am used to it by now.
It turns them on, as they are human beings.
You never know if the guy may be lying.
I cannot believe that girls can be this skeptical.
Sir, it might be two things.
For a girl, it is natural.
What a coincidence, I just dealt with that !
Resisting temptation is hard. Why fight it ? People say that the best way to resist temptation is to give in to it.
I replied that I was not dating anyone, when he questioned me.
I believe no strings attached is the best policy. You may do as you like.
Perhaps she's viewed you ogling at women?
Otherwise, you might have already known he had been with her at the same time as with you.
As long as you continue to gather numbers, you're doing well.
How can he not have time to see you, if he's not currently working?
I work with men mainly.
In addition to being extremely wealthy.
Whether she is clothed or not, always reassure her she is beautiful.
Similar to school with tv's to watch games.
Thank you for your responses.
Yes, we love it, especially if it is the person whim we have affections for who rubs us.
I am positive that she will love it.
We will have been dating each other for at least six months on Christmas day.
I am married and I have had this problem before.

Do not always dress like a guy.
It is good that you have high self-esteem.
You must demonstate to her that you care.
I estimate that i found him a minimum of five times.
In the first instance, what do you assess your probability of success.
There are many available men with good qualities, and you need not tolerate this sort of behavior.
I will you a speedy recovery, C. Fluellen.
You have got to show her that you care.
I would bet that I found him at least five times.
Well, first of all, what are your chances?
There a lot of great guys out there; You do not need to put up with this type of behavior.
I pray that you get well C. Fluellen.
Discipline them. Take privilages away. Don't let them walk all over you.
It feels so great, but sometimes it hurts a lot.
He won't kiss me, even though it's been almost a year since we started dating.
With her favorite flowers waiting. Or, a friendship ring with something personal engraved in it.
The best adjective you could come up with would be "adulterer."
Disicpline.  Remove their privileges.  Do not let them take advantage of you.
It feels wonderful but occasionally it can be quite painful.
He refuses to kiss me, although it has been a year since we began our courtship.
With her favorite flowers in wait, or a friendship ring with a personal note engraved upon it.
The best you could think up would be "adulterer".
If you were my girlfriend, I would be worried!
Your father doesn't like him so there will be not future with him.
It is good if you appreciate it, bad if you enjoy the earthly smelly look.
Quite honorable, but one would have to wonder when the red flag would pop up.
What has been done cannot be undone, it is better to not play with fire.
Should I notify her or leave it in the past?
Unfortunately, I had either become too attached or slept with them, it's been unpleasant.
Some people have it coming to them.
Do men consider sexual realtions that much more often than women do?
I would inform her as soon as possible.
To ease your mind, you need to speak with her.
She may be receptive if you try speaking with her.
I apologize in advance for being so straight forward, but do women not like that?
Even more so if she is out with her peers having a good time.
I apologize for our cultural differences, I didn't mean to offend you.
What if he were to leave his wife and family for you?
When he asks you to marry him like you were saying, ask him where the ring is.
If not, and they are not going to marry you, then no.
Perhaps you should just let him smoke weed.
I can not find my puppy; could you help me find him?
They are a hot geek, but a nerd has no confidence, therefore, no can do!
He is not only a creep, but he is stupid too.
He really loves his girlfriend, so I don't want to mess that up. But, what am I to do?
If it's "A," then forget it, she's psychotic once again.
A diamond ring will make a girl appreciate you after you made her mad.
He's attractive for a geek but that type lacks confidence so I'm not interested.
He's not only a creep but he isn't very smart as well.
He really loves his girlfriend so I don't want to interfere but what can I do?
If you have made a girl angry giving her a diamond ring will make her appreciate you.
The place you need to reach, is one where flaws no longer concern you.
You should know, that you have a friend in the United States.
He was not aware it was me, until I told him it was.
You need to move on with your life, unless there is no where for your children and you to go, save being out on the streets.
It is funny, it actually used to be public, but is no longer.
It's nice when they wear them on their rear-end only, not on their head.
Do not be in a hurry to settle down.
Thank God for brave women like us.
Carry her books, compliment her shoes (girls love that), and be sensitive.
Comfort them instead of anoying them or driving them crazy like last time.
You will risk your friendship with her, your relationship with your boyfriend, and your friend's relationship.
Austin, Texas should be a good place.
To be honest, it is somewhat depressing; Thank you, I feel pretty bad now.
I am weird in this, but I think "Hey, it is my two cents".
I see no problem with braces; They do not turn me off at all.
Of course, it depends on the girl.
This question is for men; does your girlfriend or wife watch adult movies? Do you want this to happen?  Why do you want this to happen?
They start at about 10 dollars.
a) Flirting, proving to himself that he is still desirable.
I am a Gothy/punk girl, so I personally would not be caught like that.
First, go on-line in chat rooms, then you can meet her in person.
He wants to raise the baby as it was his own child.
You really love this person, but you live with your parents and do not want to anger them.
As her why she behaves as she does.
Please give me advice on how I can move on from him.
But, I know someone back in my country.
It's been miserable, but I stayed because I thought I had to.
Tell your parents that he's a friend.
If you wouldn't do it, then she shouldn't do it.
Then, think for what it is?
But, I know a person who still lives in my home country.
It has been miserable, but I stayed because I thought I had to.
Tell your parents he is a friend.
If you would not do it, then she should not do it either.
Then what do you think it is?
I prefer well built, nice biceps.
Girls love that, and more. Appreciate the directness.
I wear thongs, and I was wondering if a lot of guys like ladies wearing them?
If she flirts with you, she likes you. If she gets mad at you for anything, she does not.
So, your opening chat should be about people; You and yours, her and hers, them and theirs.
I like a well-developed body with nice biceps.
Women like men who are more direct.
I wonder if guys like women who wear thongs because I wear them.
If she flirts with you, she likes you, but if she gets angry for nothing, she doesn't.
Because, that is what women are for.
She found herself someone gullible and he will soon be unable to meet her needs, even if ten years go by.
Next time you see him, perhaps wear a very short skirt with no underwear.
This leads me to the main problem I have seen with my Sci-Fi male friends, they do not actually talk to women.
Hetfield said, "It does not feel good until it hurts. Carpe' Deim".
If it is someone who already loves you, however, I don't think that it will matter to him.
You should run, don't walk, and don't look back.
I learned as a result of instruction from you over many years.
The measurements 36-24-26 used to be considered ideal so you are not far off.
Being direct may be difficult but it gets the message out.
They are all my friends since I do not have an enemy.
I need a woman who is open to having sex.
But, i have very strong feelings for both of them.
A weird person in bed.
I like my friend who is a guy and I wish he would ask me out on a date.
You should let the guy say it to you first.
Leave it alone; do not rush things.
When she has sex with you and then does not want to leave.
Try passing gas loudly next to her while she ties her shoe; women love that.
You know you can not see yourself with anyone else but him or her.
I think it would be on a black man.
You know that is true, girls.
Describe your time in bed and see what you are doing.
I think at first I would be a little jealous.
When she acts nervouse tell her a lot of lies about how much you know.
I had always insisted that we were only friends.
Then wait to see what he says.
Learn to not talk like a guy.
It does not matter how hard to try to get away from it, everyone wants someone to love.
A lot of adults say "Oh, kids do not know what love is".
It is alright if you are fifteen and he is seventeen.
You can fantasize about her while masturbating the next time you are in the shower.
You will be able to move on if you really want to; it is your choice.
Do not beat yourself up over that.
I do not know, but it is fine with me.
I was married to a Puerto Rican-Dominican. It was my personal experience that she was the most captivating woman.
I cannot think about another girl.
Give someone a second chance, but never give them a third.
Take as much time as you need to decide if you really love him/her.
In the beginning I liked my girlfriend as a friend, even though she loved me.
It just turns them on.
Isn't your boyfriend, your boyfriend, for a reason?
Tell the first one that something has come up, and you will not be able to go.
You can either lend them money or date them.
See if you can keep pace with us!
Females enjoy emotional men, not homosexual men, there is a difference.
That is a dumb question.
That stresses me further!
No, if you're unattractive. Yes, if you're attractive.
A little sex, but that's all.
Listen to what type of excuse he invents.
The hard truth is that you can't.
Messenger's old version: click on "add friend," and search by name, location, or Yahoo ID.
No, you might be letting the man or woman of your life go.
If it was me you were having dreams about.
If you love her, then get some assistance.
Because, that is what it consists of.
Ususally, they will tell on themselves.
Ask her to go out for a coffee or something.
If you stay every once in awhile, one to two times per week, that should not be a problem.
What if I had married him, and then moved in with him?
If you have to ask, do not ask.
I think that it would depend on what the girl likes.
However, if you want to try to get her to admit it, tease her.
Again, I am in high school and I do not associate with very many mean girls who always say mean things.
I would say do not do it.
So either way, take the time to learn about yourself; it can be fun.
I don't want to lose him.
Woman have suicidal thoughts when they can not get past a relationship.
Be a gentleman, talk about nice subjects.
How can I get him to stop?
He either feels the same way, or he does not.
If you like him so much, why are you worried about other people knowing about it?
Sit down and tell her you need to talk, and no yelling, Mom, and explain it to her!
I am a sci-fi/anime nerd, so now you know why I ask.
Can I get some mens' perspectives too?
What kind of flowers do you like?
If they ask you the reason why then tell them the truth.
Take him to your local church building.
So, I told him that maybe he needed to think about what he was saying, because "love" is a very strong word.
Why did you even inquire about this?
Speak to your mother and father.
Good luck in looking for the best answer!
Good luck in looking for the correct answer, Ice Princess P.S.
If you do, there is a large probability that she does, unless you are just conceited.
Don't give up, you will find them.
How does one act as if he is in love?
Do not flirt because it only causes problems and makes you look bad.
Tell her in your own natural words.
Attempt to spice things up.
I feel that people today will say say that they will do something even though they end up not doing it.
Because it is just flirting, do not have expectations.
Knock him out by punching him in the face.
The poem is nice; but, saying it straight to her face is manlier.
Can you suggest any websites that may have that information?
The movies are quite impressive.
I wish you much success.
You should call that person.
She will stay if she loves you.
It will feel similar to butterfly wings fluttering in your stomach.
If you decide to date others in the meantime, it's okay as well.
No, you're not supposed to search for him.
You need to ask yourself, if you ever been like this before?
No need to keep searching, that's actually normal.
I have one that I love, does that count.
I do not really think that you can.
There are many reasons that are no good for a person that gets hurt.
It was only something that you ate.
I am confining this argument to being between two people, not the bigger love.  It really matters.
Yes, they are  attractive though.
She/He comes up with nothing, even though he/she has two accounts with them.
Now you have to decide.  How would you fall in love, as a girl or a woman?
Fiance is a man or woman engaged to be married.
Anyways, one way or another, you will come to regret your decision.
And then deny me the opportunity to experience that talent?
This sounds like one person likes the other to me.
So, talk to her. If she is okay with your plan, then you should ask him.
I was shy, and could not do it at least half of the time.
You still have time to enter into a relationship.
It is preferrable for you to end it immediately.
If he will not respond, you should step and spy.
Simply tell her that she will always be a good friend, and continue.
If you love someone and are old enough to wed, you should propose.
Do not become involved in a relationship immediately after you end one.
Why am I asking this many questions?
When he is offline, she constantly says she misses him.
Do not try to be someone who you are not.
It feels fantastic to be in love. It can also hurt sometimes.
If he's your ex boyfriend, then do what you want. You don't owe anybody.
Yes, all women are sexy, some in different ways.
He only had to give you pillow talk.
Perhaps he did not enjoy the kiss, or maybe he is too young for a mature girl like you.
(At least, a daily phone call.)
She said that she would like to be friends.
It seems like you may not perform as well as the men out there.
Make a decision, he may surprise you.
I have never cheated, it is beyond my character to do so.
Boys are about one year behind of girls on maturity levels
They think I behave like an angel.
Is she near enough that she could help you in any situation that might occur?
Your preference should be a woman, not a girl.
I do not know how a person could develop a disgusting fetish like that.
I believe in being honest while not being accusatory.
If he loves you, you should take care of him sexually.
I am an American man with white colored skin.
Attempt to do what you both used to do together before you fell in love and got married.
Stop typing and go get his attention.
You cannot because they are all taken.
Do not tell him you love him.
You but, but if you are obsessed about him you should seek therapy.
I do believe in love at first sight.
Stop typing, and go yell at him!
You can't, they are all taken.
Don't tell him that you love him.
You could, but if you are obsessed over him, you should go seek therapy.
Yeah, I do believe in love at first sight.
My answer is no.
They have been married for thirty-eight years.
You deserve someone trustworthy and faithful.
We would prefer someone more mature.
It is wise to keep your personal life separate from work.
You should talk to her, the two of you both like each other, go ahead before someone else gets to her first. Good luck.
I would say that if both of you are happy, do not worry about it, but be careful.
You should marry and start a family right away.
Then he would call me only to talk, he never asked me out.
He is probably a dirty pervert anyway. Any one with self respect would not allow such an age difference.
The next step is to slowly take his hand while you are in church; you'll get the idea.
My boyfriend gets angry with me because I don't call him.
When you really want to be with someone you will find him quickly.
If you are interested, just ask him.
It may be better if they just think you are crazy but it sometimes does not work.
Yes, and you will need counciling.
You should question weather it is possible for you to do.
This is similar to the differences between democrats and republicans.
You should inform him that it is ending, but continue having sex.
This is the polar opposite of what men do.
Yes, you guys are going to need to have some counseling.
So, ask yourself, "Can I do this?".
Sort of like the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans.
Tell him that it is over, but still do not stop the sex.
It is exactly the opposite of what men can give.
Move on, and do not take her with you.
I believe that it is more of a commitment opportunity.
It is because men do not have the pain tolerance that most women do.
It is me, if you like him too.
A woman that I attended high school with had one.
Why are you asking him to marry you?
The two of you are not doing yourselves any favors.
An attractive outfit of jeans and a shirt will be great.
I am returning your question to you.
Check to see if it is in your address book.
Why are you asking him to marry you?
You're not doing yourself any favors. You aren't doing her any favors either.
But, a nice outfit with jeans and a shirt is nice.
I'm giving you back your question.
See if it is in your address book.
I have heard that some have the ability to be nine inches in diameter.
Girls are more attractive if they have long hair.
Homosexual people are not the only people who can be shallow.
You should not have a exclusive relationship yet; you should be dating multiple women and having fun.
Unfortunately women mature faster that men do, because they do not have the same maturity level.
Enjoy the icecream while you are able.
There are men waiting for you.
Women would like their boyfriends to be romantic and fun.
He is likely just irritated because you always ask.
Search Google for cruzy and you will see my point.
Enjoy icecream while you can.
There are guys waiting for you.
Women like their boyfriends to be fun and romantic.
He's probably just annoyed because you always ask.
Google the keyword "cruzy," and see what I mean.
I am sure she won't mind if you wait.
If you always say yes to her, she will be satisfied.
I just want to know how other couples are doing.
Let him have your body for 45 minutes for nothing.
My only problem is that I didn't do it sooner.
The shorter they are the better they look.
You will get the response now.
She had always wanted to accomplish it but never had the opportunity to do so.
You may go to your friend’s house instead.
Perhaps, there is an emptiness in your life.
Simply keep going until you are finished.
No. You get a nasal drip if you snort it.
Slipknot is no good. Korn is original and good.
I am eager, as well, to see the answers.
Force him to flirt first so that you are not the one to make the first move. Then everything will go smoothly.
Try to pick your game up a little bit if it is costing you.
Well, in a perfect world, three to four times a day.  I cannot get enough.
It is impolite to cut anyone off, period.  It is rude.
If you are eight, it is not okay.
You are twenty-one years of age; therefore, you are wise enough to explain how to attract a guy.
I have been with my girlfriend for four going on five years and I have had a lot of others during this time.
Do you think you are good looking?
Are all the male counterparts here this way?
All my male peers like them also.
As long as you know what you are doing, it is okay.
When girls fall in love, it is the same as playing with a doll.
I say do not even think about his best friend.  It is easier to hate you than to miss you.
I still want to be treated as an equal.
I guess that is in the past.  What is really important is your life right now.
If this suits you, that which other people say doesn't matter! I have found my perfect match and I married him!
If it so happens that they have been engaging in combat often, perhaps you should ask mother about it.
You should do it girl. I did it and it was the best thing I have ever done.
I do not understand how that is a question; it is a statement.
Well if the police are involved then she does not like you!
I would like to sleep with him now.
It could be because they are stupid, or it could be because of their self-esteem.
Consider doing this with your conversation.
Even though it may annoy you, let it go.  Be a friend and listen.
It will not work if you do not.
You will have to first tell us what exactly it is you want.
I apologize, girl, I truly wish I knew the answer as well.
Many women find themselves attracted to men who are unpleasant, also those that convey them self as "bad tough guys".
"Who need a heart when a heart can be broken?", as the song lyrics state.
This would depend on the age of the girl.
Ask a women whom you are close to such as a friend or sister, and see what they think about the situation.
No, you should not do this, it is bad.
Coming from a mans perspective, I would say no.
You cannot control it or search for it.
If he winks at you, talks to you, or asks where you are then he does.
I think you should live on and let her live on as well.
Was she really your sister or was she your best friend.
I can guarantee that he speaks poorly of you when talking to hims roommat.
Please answer all of these questions: 1) does she flirt?
I would like to attempt it again this week but I'm concerned because I was very embarrassed when it did not fit.
Some states do not do this, but some counties within the state may do so.
You should confess to her that you feel that way.
I understand that I am a man, but it works in the other way, too.
I would say flowers - normally roses - and a box of candy.
By the way, mine is green!
Some states to not, but the county within the state does.
So confess to her that you feel this way.
I know, I know I am a guy, however it also works the other way around.
Flowers, normally roses, and a box of candy.
By the way, mine is green.
I wait until I feel like I can understand my woman.
It should have been obvious to you that she had implants, so it is your fault.
I still am in love and I always will be.
Then again, sometimes men do not always know what they have until they do not have it anymore.
I wear thongs as well, and I know that men like them.
If you both enjoy it equally, then why stop?
Why are you involving yourself?
Try something different, perhaps that will spark the attraction again.
Perhaps you should concentrate on picturing her as a pet?
With that awful type of thinking, I don't believe you deserve anybody.
It is also important that you always be on the lookout for things happening around you.
Start with a nice lunch then head out for a romantic walk.
If you want to keep believing that, you are fooling yourself because she isn't that type of person.
Why do you feel that way? Was your first one lost as well?
That may end up being a very positive developemnt.
Your girlfriend should also keep her eyes wide open.
Lunch, and then go for a walk.
She is just tripping because she doesn't have it like that.
Why, did you lose your first one?
Which may be a good thing.
Men who cheat on you are likely to do it again.
I believe that sad people stay in relationships.
Does he love you? If not, do not go after him.
Do you flirt with women or look at women?
That is true, but it is up to you.
You can do anything that you would like without receiving criticism from others.
If my boyfriend was not 700 miles away right now, it would not.
Or else she has mental health issues and should see a therapist.
Ask them, and if they are, it is no fault of your own.
And you should apologize for being absent that day.
This is the only experience that is close to what heaven feels like.
If you are grounded about the situation, then everything should be fine.
Talk to them about the weather.
If doesn't ask you, then he isn't interested.
If you just showered it shouldn't be a big deal.
It is the only experience that is closest to Heaven, I guess.
As long as you are level headed about this, it should work out fine.
Talk about the weather, ha ha ha.
If he isn't asking, he doesn't want it!
If all you did was shower, it is not a big deal.
You should suggest something subtle to begin with, such as having lunch or a beer.
If you do not, there is a reason why you do no.
If there is a chance she will date you, why would you not take that chance?
If he is incarcerated, maybe you should reconsider your relationship.
Otherwise, he may have ulterior motives behind the love he proclaims.
Introduce yourself, small talk, then ask if they'd like to out.
I can't get a date ever.
I continue to be in love with her.
After fighting, love will end up being much deeper.
I've seen him during gym.
He was on his knees when he said he would attend therapy sessions, but he never did.
Learn how to dance, but not only how to dance provocatively.
If so, then give the man a chance.
Love, passion, heat, and fire are needed in the bedroom.
Good luck to the both of us.
Get a copy of both Playboy and Playgirl magazines.
No judgment of either good or bad can be made.
Her friends also approve of me and even adore me.
You should move on and find someone else.
She says she does not love me anymore and does not give me a reason.
I have the same ideology as you.
Be accompanied by plenty of females, but do not stick to them.
If you do not like him now, you will most likely not like him in the future.
Do not spend it because you are either depressed or hiding.
I wonder if she likes you.
If you do not know anything then jokes get boring quickly.
If you want a long term relationship, I am not interested.
You love this person, however your parents do not.
I like Naughty girls who are good as well as naughty girls who are just naughty.
If you don't know anything, jokes get boring really quickly.
If you want a longterm relationship, no way.
You love this person in a way your parents don't.
I prefer a naughty, good girl, and a good, naughty girl as well.
If you want to die, no matter how you slice it.
It depends on if he was good and if he is a good friend now.
For me personally, it releases a lot of stress.
He would have gotten a divorce if he really cared about you.
You would call the Psychic Friends Network.
Tell them that you are going to be at your friends house, and then meet him somewhere else.
You shouldn't stop just because you're frightened.
If you both agreed to take time off, it wasn't cheating.
It's unusual, I believe. I believe it couldn't hurt to try.
If he's popular, most likely he already has a girlfriend.
You need to get over your fear, discipline your pet.
Do not let fear overtake you.
You broke up with him when it happened.
He may or may not have a girlfriend.
If you want him to join in.
Or, is it true that what comes around, goes around?
If they say that they do mind, then, you can fix it.
Saves loads of trouble, which could come later!
Because, my place is a dump!
If you would like him to join in, then . . .
Could it be true that karma does exist?
If they are upset, then you can make amends.
This could help to avoid future problems.
My place is substandard.
But that does not mean that you can't still be nice.
Try saying to her, "Hey Hot Pants, how about a date with the Stud-Miester!"
Plan a place to go and be fun.
If you do not love him, leave him and he will be fine in time.
It is just like any other request, it's your decision!
If you are a guy, maybe you are just curious, or your self esteem is not high.
You should read the book called "He's Just Not That Into You."
You need to run quickly away from him and his family.
On the other hand, popular guys don't have many attributes that last.
You aren't, if you even have to ask.
If you're a guy, you could be curious, or maybe you aren't confident enough.
You should read the book "He's Just Not That Into You."
You need to get away from him and his family.
On the other hand, popular guys aren't always popular.
You probably aren't if you have to ask.
The letters TSGF stand for 'Transsexual Gay Female', while TSGM stand for 'Transsexual Gay Male'.
I believe women will appreciate that.
I wasn't very intelligent at that time.
Ask yourself a question: Would you like to have that knowledge?
Afterwards, we should go dancing and then go back home for some dessert.
He says he still loves me. Should I leave him alone, and hope he misses me?
I am in love with a wonderful man and I love my beautiful children.
Oh, the pornography; it was just hidden from me, so when I found it, I disposed of it.
Your world and everything you have done has been distorted because of this girl; you are in love.
Most men dream of being with an attractive 24 year old virgin. You are fortunate.
He doesn't seem to care about you enough.
Sex addiction is similar to any other addiction.
If he truly loves you, he'd act like it.
Quickly. I need some suggestions.
You have a wife, and you cheated on her with a man?
Smile at her but not so much that you frighten her.
The bottom line is that both of you should have fun.
The only answer is that they have found something better.
Bullhockey, if you want to yell at her or strike her, then you don't love her.
I wouldn't advise a relationship with him, as those with many insecurities can eventually turn dangerous.
Are you cleaning up after two untidy people?
Deep down inside, do women, think like men?
If not, try to move on.
If you don't care for that woman, why did you have a relationship with her?
Relationships are always stronger when you have a strong friendship before dating.
You should attempt to talk with other people.
You must first decide what your budget is, what she enjoys, and if you are serious about having a long term relationship with her.
In a sense, obsessively following you at your work and other places.
Many men are praying for you.
If they don't end up fighting, don't concern yourself.
If you receive no kisses, or no hugs, how will it become love?
You did it for the free kimchi, correct?
Have you ever considered if she felt the same?
You shouldn't try, let it occur naturally.
I like vibrators more than men currently, they don't speak about.
You should stop seeing him immediately.
You should take her to lay on a picnic blanket in a park, and gaze at the stars.
You should ask yourself, why do you love him?
Most likely it means he likes you.
Oh well, I do not think so.
I would like to have sex with you.
She might think it's cute that he is shy.
Sour punch straws, Hershey's chocolate, Reese's, and dairy milk
This is the day the Lord made for you!
Shouldn't he have room for his girlfriend?
If you do find out, please let me know!

Then, you could go on television and confront her, and her lover, in front of millions of people.
Can I refer to him as a good friend when I speak about him?
People fear what they do not understand, as you know.
If he is handsome, then go for it. Handsome men usually are not single for long.
Invite him to lunch soon.
Try to make your mother believe you broke up.
I would ask her, then explain why.
How well do you know the man you are in a relationship with?
Why yes, there is, and he is me.
There is nothing that disgusts me more than looking at my reflection/
Sometimes I only have sex with women to have fun and I do not even plan on returning their calls.
I only told her about one situation, but I know more that he has done than just that.
Money and nice items are wonderful, but they could not care less about you.
Maybe he would like for you to ask him.
I take women out there and they seem to enjoy themselves.
Try to figure out what it is that she really prefers to do in her spare time.
Be around your friends, because it helps to surround yourself with people who care about you.
I know guys have had this problem with girlfriends. However, I've never heard to girls having the problem with boyfriends.
It makes no matter how adult you are about it.
I don't believe he takes me seriously.
That would be wonderful if you've decided not to marry.
Perhaps you should pray about it?
I assumed I had this understood an here I am now!
Try to spell it out with your tongue.
If it makes you feel good do it!
Nothing is comparable to living on your own.
One word, Viagra, slip him some.
"Yes" and "No" have clear meanings, correct?
She and her sister received whatever they wanted due to their parents being wealthy.
Walk away and wish him well if he tells you no.
I wish I did not get tired on the weekends.
Politeness does not really work, so you should playfully tease her now and again. This is what gets my attention.
You do not have to control him as much as you do.
Do people not take there vows seriously anymore?
Just do what will make you happy.
Go back to your parents, and then start looking for a relationship so that you can marry again.
I've been with my husband for 13 years.
I think flowers are really nice. It's not that often a girl gets flowers nowadays.
You can make this work. Good luck!
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, anymore.
Like, is it ok if it's innocent?
I have been married to my husband for 13 years.
I think flowers are very nice, but flowers are not given to women very often these days.
You are able to make this successful.   Good luck!
Baby, do not hurt me, do not hurt me, any longer.
Is it okay, if it is meant innocently?
I despise feeling that way. However, I can not help feeling lustful towards young women in their twenties.
I miss her a lot as well.
Young lady, you should leave him and find someone more worthy.
You could let your husband discover you having inappropriate relations with your girlfriend.
Would you be willing to take steps to see if we could have a lasting relationship?
I hate feeling that way, but I just have this total lust for youthful girls in their early 20's.
I miss her a lot too.
Move on girl, and go find a real man.
Allow your husband to walk in on you and your girlfriend have oral sex.
Would you take the first step to see if we will make it forever?
Maybe he has past problems with trust; try to talk to him about it and give it time.
Make out with a man in front of him and I'm sure he'll leave you alone.
I prefer a good girl when we go out, with spurts of naughty during the day.
Yes, they are together and will probably be that way for a while.
If you love him work it out.
Let her go and move on.
Never look back on things like that unless it is to learn from mistakes.
I like fat women, I do not like anorexic skinny women!
Then it will kick over to another site that does not have information on the person.
I love to run, swim, and eat chocolate!
Get to know the ones you like.
Does he know the girl very well, or not?
Also, pick something you both like.
Go by, it will fall apart.
Could you help me by providing tips to obtain this girl.
I did not put to much thought into it. I was just having casual conversations with people for fun.
It would seem as though he may have been involved in some dangerous activity. So why waste you time on someone of that quality?
Be wary and brave and eventually you will obtain all that you need to have.
Do you believe that your boyfriend is unfaithful to you?
She waited a year and then told her about our relationship.
If you are a so-called "nice guy" in high school some students will take advantage of you.
Please leave them alone because they will be offended by your ego.
If you listen to your hear, you will always wonder what might have happened.
That is the best thing that guys notice about girls.
Sometimes the guys forget that I am still a girl.
Friends stand by each other no matter what happens.
You are a convenience to him and nothing more than that.
Women love being told that they are pretty!
I am not saying with other women but definitely with you.
In some cases, if you wait too long you lose out.
My assessment is that you should try to help them make it legitimate because you care as well.
The reason is that it's easier to obtain a correction.
I don't know whether he if fond of me, however.
Tell him that it makes you excited.
Ninety percent of my best friends are male.
Guys like girls that do not play games or leave them guessing.
Hold hands, kiss, deeper kiss, and there you are.
Please note that this has to take less than ten seconds.
I hope it does not rule us out.
If you continue doing what you are doing, you will get anything you want.
Trust me, I am an expert on this.
I do not think those shoes go with that outfit; I am gay.
It may be a while if you cannot fart around him.
If he attempts to say he's just kidding, tell him that you are not.
Do you any idea why my boyfriend watches pornography?
The solution is to keep asking him until he opens up and talks.
God definitely has to come first.
It's not a good idea to have a reputation for switching guys like gloves.
Most women can only please one man at one time.
Men are able to provide women an aspect of life that they cannot provide themselves, the same way women provide an aspect of life men cannot provide themselves.
I am speaking with you currently.
Most males would state that it is not fun and you should disreguard yourself if you ask.
She do it with everyone.
Be careful but tell her.
Do not sweat it, my mom is nice.
Tell your kids to pick up their stuff.
Here's a good hint!
Is it hot in here or are you just hot?
Even if they are not thinking, it does gel.
Sappy version at one, and geek version at two.
Not if you just met this guy.
A kind that only you can know and love.
If not, then it probably means nothing.
Get on your knees and take care of him.
Soppy version at one and geek version at two.
Not if you have just met this man.
If not, then it probably means nothing.
Get on your knees and pleasure him.
If you are only speaking about normal, everyday things, than he probably likes you.
I used a time-out chair for all four of my boys and after a few times it got better.
Or, just bend over a lot in front of him.
You can not win the lottery if you do not buy a ticket, right?
I met a guy online and he handcuffed me to the steering wheel in his van, so I guess I did!
Mostly all the people I know aren't genuine!
I do. I think it's cute.
She is obsessed, and that is a big problem.
Why in the freaking hell would you do that?
Make the one that is right for you.
A majority of the people I know are fake in some way.
I do think it is cute.
It is a problem that she has an overwhelming infatuation and obsession.
Please explain to me why you would ever believe doing that is a good idea.
Create something that fits your interests.
Why does he feel the need to cheat if he loves you?
It is most likely something you need to accept since once a watcher of pornography, always a watcher of pornography.
Just be yourself and have a good sense of humor!
Yes, I believe in love at first sight and I will never compromise!
Using "people talk" is probably the very best way to start a conversation with a woman.
When you feel weak in the knees, you will know...trust me!
I would like my girl to be petite, sociable, witty and sweet.
It really depends on if you want to maintain a good relationship with your ex.
Why would a girl stop loving a guy who loves her more than anything else?
No matter what age the two of you are, it's always a BIG step.
You should personally connect with her to let her know you want to continue your friendship.
I disagree with the thought that you greet her at a later point.
You have damaged the relationship with me and with our children.
I am of the view that it depends on the woman.
If you are getting too upset, pause the conversation.
Girls and nerds alike are cute and look honest.
Cheating on you once is a mistake but twice?
My parents still do not know that I have had boyfriends.
Two people want my attention.
Well, first, take a deep breath.
She may want you to leave.
Sometimes I see us walking on the beach.
Your ex doesn't care about you, so you need to carry on with your life.
I do not agree because there are blind people that feel in love without seeing the other person.
Take a deep breath, walk up to her, and say, "Hello, would you like to go somewhere?
If you think more about it, you may decide you are less certain that you initially thought you were.
Your current situation is good.
First, you did not say how old you are.
Many people who do not do drugs are nonethess unpleasant individuals.
Acting that way does not display empathy.
I can not as her directly since we do not talk anymore.
You should only get married if you love someone, not just because you are having a child together.
I dislike it with a passion.
Let him know if was just a fling.

Try your hardest to win her affections back.
Just do not try to talk to her.
It is more enjoyable this way, but it is not required.
Are you sure you love her?
I think they do. The situation is similar when white women are attracted to black men.
In addition, we are both in our late twenties.
You are a good friend, but my feelings go beyond friendship.
They are sexually attractive and a turn-on!
Your heart is telling you to go and confess to her!

Don't date losers an cons.
Stay at home cook a good meal and grab a dvd.
I'm lucky to find a woman with both.

If you do, can I ask why ?
He is not worth it if he is willing to ruin a good thing for a fling.

Consider this before you decide to give yourself to him.
No matter the outcome, he'll need you to be there for him.
Is this the same you you were previously telling me about?
I have hope that you will get married.
After investing so much into the relationship, it was extremely hard to get through the separation.
Just tell your man that you have had enough, and it is either you or her.
Usually, men who are insecure want you to do this to boost their egos.
I think it is a good practice to wait until you are married to have sexual relations.
We cannot simply live together as man and wife anymore.

I don't see anything wrong with a little bit of physical affection.
Ask him what is going on with that other girl.
Why are you asking this question I wonder?
Hello @chillin, I agree with @superman, you should cast your vote for him!

You may see it as a date, but I do not.

If he feels the same way I do, is that true love?
What do you mean by this question?
She introduced me to a nurse she knows.

Some people do not take marriage seriously.
They no longer care.

Does all this mean he likes me?
If you like him, do not exaggerate it.
Treat her differently than you would other girls.
If I were in your position, I would tell her.
You don't know how the other person will react.
People who cheat on their partners likely don't care much about them.
My husband and I are both 28 years old.
That means that she loves you for you.
You were his friend, and is know with their mom, so be careful what you wish for.
Why won't he let me go?

I was 22 years old when we met.
I suspect that you gave him your heart and body long ago.

He is waiting until marriage.
Why are you refusing to call him?
If a man cheats once he will cheat again.
Who couldn't use another good friend?

It is due to the men you are choosing, because not all men act that way.
Ask his friends for assistance in entering into a relationship.

Yes, to my little cousin, but not to someone special.
Tell them it's over I don't want you, you're a jerk.

Before you do this, consider how it will affect everyone else around you.

You can be the best friend in her life.
Best wishes in your future relationship.
He can doubt that we notice his actions, but we assuredly do.

No, I do believe some ladies are very cute, but I never could do anything with them.
Why are you being a jerk to your friend? If she is bugging you just tell her.

This statement is neither wrong or right.

If they do enough things, then you won't be in love with them any more.
Just like with all men, they have some that are sweet and some that are jacka**es.
It should not be important to him.
It is time to live the life of a married person!

Inquire and see if he is responsive.
Increased proximity of time will result in a lower emotional burden.
Are you inquiring as to how to incite arousal?
Being in a committed relationship is not required to have a satisfying life.
You just seem irresponsible at the point.
Yes, this is the 2nd new girlfriend, she is two years older.
She has to be at least a 7.5-9.5 unless I really like her.
If your parents don't like your boyfriend, they probably have a good reason for it.
We both agreed that she wouldn't see or hangout with her friends until the first of March.

Oh that's my cousin, her nick name is Her.
I mean you are really into him!
I like to make friend with her.
First a question for you. How old are you?
Send him a query first, then decide to advance to a further rank.
If otherwise, it is rather unreasonable for you to ask her to refuse refreshment.
Perhaps a massage would be of use in the calming of her nerves, prior to her participation in the act of procreation.
If it is necessary to inquire, then love is not present.

If you are seeking attention and he is not giving it to you, then you might need to seek out a new man.
Shee is still very young and there will be time for her.
What happened was, I encountered the person she was dating and proceeded to physically register my displeasure.
a locale where scantily-clad females perform
They were introduced via the internet.
You would not want him to die before your children go to college.
My boyfriend just ended our relationship.
And to forget about ever being with him at all.
I said it wrong and that is the understatement of the year. You are very hot and attractive.

I just enrolled into this new high school, and I am really shy.
Honey, aren't you a little young to be getting married now?
Many will try to tell you it isn't a big deal, most likely because they are no longer virgins.
I think she certainly summed it up right there.

He is a year older than me.
I am not sure, but, it may be 18.

If she was a real friend, she should understand.
If nothing is downloaded, it is probably her realizing that fart does stink.
He seems like he is a bit disturbed,  run away fast!
Why are you trying to changes someone?  This is not your responsibility.
The best thing a husband can hope for from his wife is that she does not do a lot of shopping.
You should give a plant in a container that he likes such as a car or a beer can.
Guys also do it, it is not limited to being only women that do.
Tell him to close his eyes and describe you!
What was a really cool way in which you met someone special?
Ask him if he loves you or that gold digger; tell your niece that.
And in the end, just say, "hope to see you again."

How long after the first date should I contact them?
I stared at her and sometimes she would catch me.

You'll need to do some serious soul-searching.
I suggest telling her she needs to wait a few years.
Say "I care about my boyfriend".
Avoid self-help books at all costs.
I despise the fact that people are attempting to tell me what to do.
Either all of the good ones are taken or I can not locate one.
I believe we all have bad days, but you have to persevere not to let the negative days bring you down.
I hope women with that mindset will not lose hope.
Thank him for his concern, but he can not tell me what to do.
Don't be afraid to express to him your true feelings.
Do you want to be with him? You should tell him and his friends that he doesn't have control over you.

If he is being unfaithful to you then you should separate from him.
If you simply flirt with her then she will realize your intentions.
But, if he does notice, tell him the way you feel about him and the way you feel about pool.
I like the actress, Jessica Alba. However, I would never be unfaithful to the girl I love.

Dump him, and then take care of yourself.
Women can chase after me all they want.
I hope that it all works out for you!
God was up in heaven smoking weed when he created them, please forgive me God.
You ask her do unreasonable things and then become upset when she refuses to do them.
Not a chance, sir, none at all.
(I am aware that my mother died.)
The best option is to avoid prolonging the matter and giving her the impression that you are interested.
Yes, never allow anyone to hold you hostage in such a manner.
You're not going to have a good time if he's always angry.
It sounds to me that all he wants is sex and all you want is love.
I am not a doctor! You should go and find somebody that is and get that checked out!
It's something everybody does and you shouldn't worry about it.

Not all women are decent human beings.
Although the relationship eventually dissolved, I was very fond of all four of the women.
If you see a kind woman, that is a good location, you can meet her there. I wish you the best.
Sorry, that is just the ways that things worked out.

Girls are like flowers: treat them nicely, and you get it in return.
I stopped looking at her Myspace page. (I do not want to stalk her.)
I like facial hair on a man.
Ask him if he is interested in you.
What women do not have that men most likely do have.
Yes, I would date her.
I would like to go to bed with you.
You will survive, but if you love this person enough you should try to fix your relationship with him or her.
This person is eighteen years old, works at a liquor store, and has a strict grandmother whose wishes must be respected.
Tell her not to be afraid to do it, but the truth hurts.
Outside the door or outside the window?
If he has not asked you yet, then he is probably not ready.
The girl above us just said exactly what I planned to say!
I believe if something is done once it can be done again!
What makes a girl appealing is large breasts and a large amount of cash!

God is always with you and will always provide an answer.
You should not care what they thing, just show them your true beauty.
No, I do not know what you mean.
I just had to get to know him more before I could accept my own feelings.
If I could, I would do it 2-3 times a day.
How can I find her?
Should I go out with her?
He will pursue you, it isn't the other way around.
Second, only seven? That isn't a lot these days.
How many times will this question be addressed?
As they say, once a cheater, always a cheater.
You should talk to him.
Some women act strangely after you say you love her.
Do not ask him for a list of things to do.

We are both redheads so I'm going to need some help.
I do like that idea.
Be assertive with him and tell him what you are going to do. You do not need to ask his permission.
I told the first person that I knew.
If that doesn't work in a mont or two, leave him, he isn't worth it.
Why are you going out with this girl if you don't actually like her?
As they always say, once a cheater, always a cheater!
Have some drinks with him and then ask him bluntly, most men won't remember what embarrassing things they said when they sober up.
Always do what your parents tell you!
She should have good manners.
Try and find a single girl.

My best friend and I have been friends since 9th grade, we are out of school now so anything is possible.
They are very hard to find.
Don't automatically assume that is what people think of you.
I don't know anyone, I'm sorry.
Yes I would like to be friends with you and you are welcome to send me messages in my inbox.
Apparantly these things frustrats guys.
We are such a match that she would be the lock and I would be the key.
We both have to work on things.
We think we are very good at it.
Teach me about men. They are so complex
I'm not sure, he may have just gotten bored.
You should try to understand the meaning behind what he did. Also, be more open with him.
My reasoning is that we do not need them to be trained to disagree with us.
You should wait until he is ready to ask you.
No, it is not wrong at all!
Take a chance.  All she can say is no.
If it is his only one, you are out of luck.
Can I buy you a drink or do you prefer money?
I would not worry about it yet.
Date other people, and work on yourself, you're your top priority.
Love is an emotion not an attraction, at the end of the day you love who is best for you.
Don't let what they said get on your nerves.
Take a chance, you only live once!
Yes I do, and I am forever grateful that he did.
They will realize later that falling in love is not easy
I am a person that truly loves with all my heart
I love my boyfriend so much
I don't think i have ever been in love
That is not right, the answer master has the correct answer
Go get a rubber ball and let's get this game started!
You're a little young to be dating, don't you think?
I have to ask, why date someone at your age?
Twelve is far too young to be dating.
If you think he is cheating, he probably is.
He called 24/7, and visit everyday.
Laugh it off and say, whoever the guy is . Hes lucky.
If you just be yourself and have a good personality, then finding a decent girl will be no problem.
Anything is possible in love and war
Im 18 and addicted. I lost it in march when i turned 18.
To start, ask her if she likes you.
Time is forever. And you want to spend forever with him, right?
Remember that Jesus was a virgin.
But here is some great advice to help you find your purpose. I am sure it will help.
Certainly not. Obviously you do not care for or love her, so why cheat?
However, be sure he is a nice person and you love him.
Additionally, stop going for walks in her company.
I can emphasize with the difficulty in moving on from that type of situation.
If I am able to provide advice to you.
I am not being serious as that has never been successful for me, actually only time and affection from another person will heal a broken heart.
Date, if you really want to learn.
Make that two hundred boys.
No matter what Rachel,we will always be friends.
Beforehand, my guy mentioned that it was embarrassing to him.
I have thrown up in class.
I plan on getting some cologne or silk boxers for my boyfriend.
Yes. That is correct, so let it happen.
I do not want to hurt your feelings or make you feel like I am against you, but it would be beneficial for you to stop engaging in activities like that.
First you need to engage her in flirty conversation, and then you need to ask for her email.  Once you have the email, you can tell her your thoughts.
I am thinking about ending my relationship with him and would appreciate your help.
My boyfriend has called my "baby", and "honey", for the past 6 years.
Are you not going to go out with me?
Get a fishing pool, and a ticket for a great fishing spot.
It is on the internet and on the radio.
Of course, you aren
Go to a disco, and you will find a lot of them that will want to have sex with you.
You might be allergic to latex condoms or the spermicide.
You can't force her to forgive you if she is upset.
Just don't give up, and try to remain strong.
He's really shy, I've known him for almost 3 years.
Am I overreacting or something?
Certainly not, I go out with many friends, but I don't consider myself as one who dates an excessive number of men.
With a sexy tone, "Good luck".
He obviously does not love if you if he is having infidelities.
Enjoy it as often as you can.
What will I do if it happens again?
There are only two times that I want to be with you and they are now and forever.
I noticed that girls also "Check out", just like guys do.
What sort of things does she like?
You are on the wrong site.
If you give it some time, you will find her.
I have been participating in cultural interaction and now I want this in my marriage.
Perhaps visit the gym and gain some muscle mass.
You could tell her that you are not interested in ruining your marriage, life, family, kids, and reputation.
I said No, as in I do not love you.
Always; which is why it does not matter how bad it gets, keep in mind that, "this too shall pass!"
Who says brainy women are not pretty?
Other than that, maybe they just really do not feel loved.
His voice gets softer whenever you two talk.
As for me, I like chatting with any guy on the internet; what is your email?
It is nice to believe that appearance does not matter, but it most certainly does.
Why you do not stop talking and be silent.
We have tried counseling, but the counseling did not work because, for one, we did not finish it.
It all depends on the situation, but I guess I would say that honesty is always the best policy!
Smile and allow her to talk first.
When you do find her, do not mess things up!
I may be a little overprotective, but God, if she is already acting that way at the age of five I will go ballistic.
But sometimes men can be foolish and shy.
I need one, too, but it will not come from sitting down. Go out and have fun!
Fat people make me nauseous. I would never date a fat person.
I have no idea if I should stop being more than a friend to her or fight for her.
Let him make the first move because it is more romantic and you are not too young to kiss.
I found some lip stick in the vehicle.
The best way to propose to your girlfriend is to ask her to marry you.
I finally gave in because I was tired of him.
I've heard that there is someone for each of us.
I believe that you should follow your heart.
I prefer 18 and up, but you will know when you are ready.
Thin is the fashion, so choose the skinny one.
Although there are no rules in bed, you should give each other the freedom each deserves and keep very good communication.
Yes, I did enjoy an evening with him.
I am a black woman who loves my black man very much.
Or, performing sexual relations with a person but only one of them achieves orgasm. I do not consider this sex, I consider this making out.
So, you should ask your own friends how to find woman who are available to date.
I suggest you tell him. You will never know, it is possible he might want you to.
I was curious as to how old her boyfriend is, is he the same age?
It would take too long, most likely two mounts, so try your best!
That means 1 in 4 men will not cheat on their partners.
Would you like some meat?
Maybe you should ask her?
However, a decent guy would not mind.
If you are asking this question, maybe you are a bit too young to know the answer.
Because men are swine, performance and physical attractiveness are the only words in their dating rule book.
Get out of the house.
If she says no, then respect her reasons and do not push.
If she does, do you really want that kind of woman in your life?
Yes, some of the best tricks out there.
I'm not saying other races are not, I'm saying from my experience I find them that way.
Why would he believe that of you and his best friend.
I am more interested in the relationship and getting to know my girl.
It is because many of you women allowed them to do so.
You need to tell your friend that you have feelings for her or stop having feelings for her.
No, because if they are in relationships then they must possess a noticeably attractive quality, do you understand?
They kissed for fifteen to twenty-five seconds, since it was New Year's Day. Then they had coitus for close to an hour.
Attempt to be single for some time. It will do you some good if you succeed.
Is it possible to have sex with your clothes still on?
Maybe this is because you are a virgin.
This is what you need to do, show him a little bit of your hips, and your thighs.
The experience was so eye opening!
I need a boy to tell me that he likes me.
Show her your affection by doing things she enjoys. Such as, finding her something she desires or needs.
Of course she will know. If she looks at you then she will like it.
Have you spent much time with her?
Furthermore, it did not matter how much I tried to be kind.
If you are interested in positions, then I suggest you get a book relating to the matter.
Collect your children and leave at this moment.
Do not allow him to pressure you to accept marriage.
Simply tell her that she is gorgeous.
Initiate a conversation with him.
A friend of mine is recently single, and she insists that this works.
I'm mean to the guys I like because it my way of saying 'I like you.'
Wow! This is the one I actually know about.
Just don't let him/her manipulate your mind for a pretty long time.
My advice is be careful of what you ask for.
He sounds very dull and does not seem really interested in you.
Yes, I paid for my best friend to go to camp.
Even though it is hard, and you miss the person, we've been able to find ways around that.
Provide it for me and I'll give it a shot.
I am proud to be one, sweetie. After all, I'm thirteen.
I've never been in a relationship with this man before.
It's not as if I woke one morning and said "Oh I think I I'll be a lesbian.
Of course you still love her and I can't blame you for that.
Get close to his friends and be a genital girl in front of him. Make him see your beauty.
The best is to be honest.
Just remember that time heals all and in time you will be healed.
Be honest and let him know that you feel like he is ignoring you.
Love does not know time and it can not die. It is something that is rooted in your soul.
I like this girl that I met at a camp and she lives far away. My advice is that you should just follow where your heart leaves you,
I am feeling very curious and impatient.
The problem is finding somebody who wants all of it.
No matter what she's cooking, display that you're cooking a gourmet meal.
Always believe in yourself.
Where can I find their website?
My father raises his voice about the situation because my sister is not present.
He didn't ask me for a companionship, so I just decided to go ahead and ask him.
If you require a sexual release, then move on and leave this girl alone.
Homosexual men, as long as they have excellent taste.
Once you have the feeling that you cannot imagine a life without him, the you will know.
If I kissed a close friend, I would not be able to forget this either.
Perhaps a better idea would be to mail it to the wrong address?
You cannot go wrong if you do it that way.
No, your avatar does not look very nice.
Commitment is best with women who are independent and are not scared to put it on them.
I think the ones I catch do because it is the only way to make them be still.

How do I have him converse with me about his life and how he calms down?
Are you listening to music right now?

If the girl eats too much.
Do you think we are spoiling men with these actions?

No, that lie would be unnessary.

If you love you will tald to her.
Do not strike back, two wrongs do not make a right.
Rub her back or something you know, make it exciting.
Do you think I should break-up with him?
Even though you are the smallest person, it is the average...1 tablespoon...
However, do not date him if you are not inclined to.
No. Are you an online stalker?
Remove yourself and simply leave her alone.
In all sincerity, I think it does.
Tell him that you will be bored this weekend.
My girlfriend does.  My wife does not.
Dear, if you put God first in all things, you will find there are good men.
You can learn many things from others.
There are plenty of girls that would say, "Yes".
If she wants the attention, she will answer right.
Is that only in your mind?
After you kiss you can tell.
Right now I have a girlfriend.
Think about it before sex becomes boring.
The average size of a penis is between 5 and 7 inches.
I have learned a lot about myself.
It depends on how willing you are to be the second of the bunch.
Just take my advice and consider it to be okay.
I want to end my "adventure" because I am not in my twenties anymore.
I believe most men get chocolates.
This will lead to more affection.
Avoid her if she is constantly altering her personality.
I can not forget her.
It is more cleansed and elegant.
That's awful, if she doesn't want to then she isn't worth it.
Listen up everyone who doesn't understand.
Have you ever dated a man because of any of these reasons?
Well you are young, and you only just got kissed.
We don't make love often, if at all.
If he screws up again, dump the bum.
For example: Snow White, Cinderella, and others!
Strawberries and cream, regular whipped cream, chocolate, honey, cinnamon, and others.
It is a good sign.
He lives far away from his best friend who was hurt really bad.
Please, your question seems to be confusing.
All men show their affection for you differently.
I meet other girls and have menages a trois with him.
That they will not be enough of a man.
Approach him and say, I like french fries, do you?
Listen, I have advice for you.
Yes, approximately six weeks in advance.
Pain that does not kill you causes you to become stronger. Do not give up.
Why would you make yourself look dense like that?
The parents are straight, the son and daughter are both homosexual.
I have a screwdriver to open my beer with, and no teeth for my fecal matter, and I'd appreciate it if you were silent.
I do not believe that to be cheating.
I'm willing to wager that he's going to leave him without ever having sexual intercourse with him.
You need to raise your standards on who you sleep with.
It's a great feeling to be in love. We should know that.
I find it rather sweet, myself.
You're only 16 years old. I would suggest finding someone else.
There's always a way, no matter what anyone says.

You could be direct with your advances by flirting, asking a friend to speak on your behalf, writing a letter or sending an email.
If the guy decided to allow the woman to pay for herself on the date.

At a very young age I realized I was attracted to women.
That will happen to the best of us. I assure you.

It all comes down to the person who committed the act.
I do not understand why this is even an issue!
Have women as friends, and when there is a conversation looking for romance end the conversation quickly.
Go ahead and make your own rules.
If you truly love each other then you should not, but you can still flirt with other men.
There are many things to consider here.
Some individuals do not know anything about search.

Do not bite, eat a breath mind, and blow gently.
I need help solving this problem, it is really making me nervous because I like her.
If you sacrafice your career, she will complain that you do not mae enough money.
If we make up our mind, it can either be very difficult or very easy.
You should thank your aunt if you get married.
Girls will always like surprises.
We are in our teens and have been dating for almost five months.
Your heart is telling you to talk to her and express your feelings.
It does not make sense to pretend not to like him when in actuality you do.
Love and a good new project will help you in life.
I may be setting myself up to be hurt in the long run.
Ask her if she has met any guys.
They are curious if she can spell.
Velma and Shaggy: no, but Fred and Daphne: yes.
If you are going for family planning, then take care.
Stop, and think about each woman.
If you want the presentation, feel free to email me at shakya.b@gmail.com.
He has feelings for his wife, and he will not leave her.
He would then realize, both, what I mean to him and what we mean to each other.
I am in a relationship with this boy, but my friends do not really like him.
If you try saying sorry, then she will give you another chance.
Now she is dating another guy that I have always disliked, and it is tearing me apart.
If he does not get the hint, casually say,"Let's go together."
She may not be ready to discuss it yet.
That person can call me.
You know that I am not a man.
Please cuddle me, hold my hand, hug and kiss me, and finally, have amazing sexual intercourse with me.
I do not think you will watch much television.
I am having difficulty with my mother's boyfriend.
You should have her get tested for sexually transmitted diseases.
You could say, "I want to get married, but am not willing to wait."
Yes, sex is part of marriage and is an action of love.
When they try to pick on you, I'll be around.
Turn the situation around on him, and see if he's innocent then.
There are not to many men like that.
If you are talking about yourself, your not supposed to be on that if you are under 13.
True love comes along when you least expect it!
If he likes you he will treat you rudely and ignore you.
Her attractive arms correlate with her having an attractive body.
Yes, I agree you must trust a man just as he must trust in you.
Your children may be misbehaving to get your attention, perhaps you may spend more time with them?
You say he wronged her, perhaps you feel wronged with him being with her. Previous actions are hard to stop.
Any one of the children here could lie and say they are eighteen years old.
Small breasts are not a bad thing, but ugly breasts are not as desirable.
You will have to ask your mother.
My best friend is more valuable than having money.
After you ask him, watch his facial movements.
I do not desire to appear indecent, but what occurs to another, occurs to oneself.
Of the utmose seriousness, I would be informing that male paramour to vacate the relationship.
It is not at all incorrect.
Because they are more risky, and they allow life to be more spontaneous.
For men, I believe it is better and bad.
He does not deserve you.
Tell me what is right about it.
I believe it is better for men.
Can you encourage him to seek help from an adviser?
First, you need to apologize, then express your love in the form of a letter or some other action to prove your love for her.
He is a married man, and you should keep your distance out of respect for his wife
You need to decide for yourself if he has the potential to grow in a positive direction.
He is aware that he may look, but he cannot touch.
@Gmoore, other men have seen angels, but I have seen thee, and thou is art enough.
If you are 21 and over, if his friends know your name, he probably likes you.
You could say that you're better now.
I am worried, I can't stop thinking about her.
Once you've lost, you never get it back.
I know it always pains the children.
In your life what week has been paramount?
Is that enraged adoration?
An adolescent has chemical substances convincing her she is in love.
I am making a choice because it is needful.
I want a boyfriend who is actually there for me and physically present.
No, there may not be love at first sight but there can be like at first sight.
What does two years mean if you want to spend the rest of your life with that person?
That always excites me!
If you are trying to toilet train a 2 year old, get Pull-Ups.
If you marry her, there's always the possibility of her gaining your assets if you divorce.
It appears that you can save it if you do.
Any time a relationship ends, it's difficult.
If you're sure that she's your friend, she shouldn't do that.
In my opinion, you're best friends for a reason.
Maybe if you think about it, you will find an answer.
Converse with more people, and make more friends.
Don't do it by yourself, you deserve so much better.
We need to more than woman do, yes we do.
My aunt married her boss without any problems!
Get a girlfriend an post pictures of you both or don't an ignore her.
In a hard situation, best of luck.
My boyfriends mom use to smoke an she can spot a pot head when she sees one.
If he's a good friend he will help you support the baby.
You should not do something if it does not feel right.
You should inform them that it is no one's business who you date.
There are none that I feel I can write currently.
You know it when you feel butterflies in your stomach when you are around him.
He seems to know what he wants.
I am bisexual, not homosexual, and welcome others' opinions.
I am in the same situation, my man satisfies me, but I need more.
You will meet the right person if you are patient.
I was absolutely furious, but I had very little choice.
If a man shows he does not want you, he is not worth wasting your time on.
Try convincing her to change her mind.
I want to tell my brother what I did, but I want to stop that crazy woman first.
Try new experiences, attempt new ways of living.
There are some people that are sincerely interested in a girl's personality.
She is putting her best effort into improving a bad situation.
There are large amounts of black men attempting to succeed, but only a few are successful.
I hope that this is a help to you and good luck.
The usual is sleeping when it's cold and swimming when it's hot.
Regardless of the situation, never ask, "Can I kiss you?"
There are many radio station with sites similar to that, at least hear in ohio.
I would say yes, there would not be any further questions.
In your heary, you know what to do.
When you care about the person, and the person is all you think about, then you are in love.
If he is gay, how did he make love with you the night before he leaves?
My siblings are very annoying, I cannot live with them.
In my opinion, it really matters how much you love your woman.
I was fifteen years old when it first happened but it did not happen again until I was eighteen years old.
Sometimes, we feel like breaking the rules ourselves.
I suggest that you pay attention and stop acting that way.
Nothing you could ever do could stop us from loving you.
Ask questions so you will know her likes and dislikes.
Think it through.
Let him know that a God-fearing wife is hard to find.
First, find a girl, talk to her, and ask her what she wants.
Be smart about how you go about it.
If he asks you why, explain to him that perhaps you should see other people.
I think you take your soul to your heart.
Explain to him that he may lose his wife.
But do not take it casually for too long, that just confuses everyone.
But consider this, if you were not in this position, then someone else would be.
Yes, I think that way about Fred and Daphne, but not Shaggy and Velma.
Regardless of age, you cannot control who you love.
You are too young to worry about such things.
Next, attempt to break his bones.
We are merely sixteen but we have been together for three years.
One must be born with talent of that nature, as I was.
I prefer redheads and brunettes to blondes.
Acquire a whip and some leather.
Please don't hurt him.
We were younger when we started dating.
Some people are born with talents.
People say redheads and brunettes are smarter than blondes.
Get the belt.
You should break up with him and move on.
They intrigue and tempt us, but they are wild and dangerous.
No girl wants to be with someone who is fake.
You should stay with him for the sake of your children. To do otherwise would be selfish.
It makes me wonder what they're for.
If he just wants to have sex, then our relationship would not last long at all.
Who says you have to choose? Haha, OK, I am just kidding around with you.
I have had six surgeries in the last two years.
I think that your husband is cheating, or on the verge of cheating.
Please email me at: down4anythinguwant@yahoo.com or misslovable36@hotmail.com
Do not sigh for that.
I have attempted that, but you cannot convince yourself to care for someone.
First, they may be close friends, and the attractive female really enjoys her friend.
That means he obeyed the law exactly.
Do you plan to marry one, but are uncertain whom to marry?
They have known each other for a while, so they think that they are good together.
I have more feelings for my ex-boyfriend, and I want him more.
Things turn out better if you always keep God in your life.
I do not know what a troll is, and I do not care.
Be yourself and things will work out.
When you are as tall if not taller then the C.N Tower!
Yes I knew a boy would date your avatar.
You shouldn't be with any guy who has three lovers.
If your not a very attractive guy, it helps to be a funny one.
Do it after the major holidays so you won't have to buy her anything.
You should go out and have a blast with your girlfriends.
I do enjoy her eyes, lips, and personality.
Please email me and let me know if it works.
My boyfriend and I fool around in his pool house because he has one in there.
You should honestly choose one woman and stick with her to avoid having a double life.
By the way, you are acting like an idiot!
That happened to me before!
You do not need a boyfriend when you are 12 years old, as that is rather young.
Do not try to hard and just be yourself.
Do not do it if the age difference bothers you.
Furthermore, the reason is not because you want to be unfaithful to him, but that you crave for physical relations with other men.
I believe you need to date men similar to me.
Now he wants to have us be married. I love him very much, should I trust him?
Also, are you aware of any cute names for a baby?
You should tell him he will be a father, do not be naive.
Give it a try, but do not get your hopes up.  Good luck!
Now all that remains is to get out of debt! (Which we are slowly doing.)
He obviously loves his wife and has no plans to leave her.
The better we feel, the more we are loving it!
I do not like to chat, because I would rather get down to business.
Leave him to be alone for some time and watch what develops.
If you intend to be unfaithful, then end the relationship. It will not improve.
A lot of coitus, good fellatio, and no complaints.
No, you utilize what you have. Some men like small breasts.
Nothing is happening between us anymore. I believe it is because we are both reserved. I am very confused.
She must need a boyfriend.
I would not be fair to your new love interest if you still wish to be romantically involved with your ex-boyfriend.
You should attempt to make him notice you and then let destiny determine your future.
Women are never satisfied, never trustworthy and never accept the truth.
Do not lie, for lying will only make the situation worse.
Also, take their garbage outside.
Trust me, for I am your faithful wise man.
Try to make it work, but don't get overly attached.
If she says no, do not get discouraged, try again.
Until you have fulfilled your career goals.
It is possible that this is the best thing that you have to offer.
You should practice with a lollipop.
If your boyfriend is married, you should leave him to be with his wife.
Do you think that I am not sufficient for him, and that he is not afraid to lose me?
My boyfriend was doing the same thing, and I did not find out until almost two years later.
They are entertaining.
They want a wife who is attractive and good at sex.
Since you two are friends, maybe she will understand your feelings.
Shouldn't you be doing your homework?
Yes I am 13, but she just wants to talk to people.
If you are aquainted well enough, you are familiar with what he likes.
If you are getting your penis damp through the mail then yes.
It may lead to love, but usually it does not.
A magical thing you can say to him: do not fret too much, simply, man
Sledding, riding on horse back, and even visiting the local shooting range.
The only thing you should be careful of, is not to send an inappropriate message.
It goes on the left hand next to the pinky finger.
Don't forget to confess your problem to him.
Women want they don't have and could never have.
I think that you should ask him how he is doing.
If you are in love, don't deny it and work hard on your studies too.
Handsome men can get away with that; so they do it.
If you are having problems and you two aren't patient, kind, and understanding with each other: then you are not in love.
Because, you are still unmarried.
So everyone is happy and loving it.
This is the present, not future or the past.
Some girls move faster then others.
If you care, you will talk to her about it first.
Of course, after long hugs and kisses, it will be a day he will never forget.
Compose a letter and state that you do not want him to contact you again.
I don't get why anyone would find her attractive.
This is the best way to see if my family likes my new guy.
Now that is a good question.
This is the most fub I've had on the internet.
You  have to decide whether your friend or this guy is more important to you.
I feel nervous and nauseous whenever I see her around school.
Go out, have fun, and learn about different people.
Right before he went in, he cheated on me.
You will eventually want to do it, but do not.
That means there is no way she does not know that you are still alive.
You ought to wait until you are both in love or married. It only now occurred to me to ask: how old are you?
It seems that you have already resolved this. Or have you?
It is dependent on how attractive the person is.
How old are you, if you do not mind the question?
Simply say hello, acknowledge that you like her and then become acquainted with her.
If you and she went out, would you be untroubled?
This is an acronym, not a quotation.
The word "swimming" contains the letter 'M' whereas "swinging" contains the letters 'NG.
In the event you are an opportunist and wanted a rich woman, then you must do foxy little works.
My answer to you is; If you are uncertain you would want something done to yourself, refrain from doing it to his spouse.
You need to leave her!
Do you want to conjure up desires that shouldn't exist?
I took her to dinner at an expensive restaurant, and then a movie.
My yahoo messenger ID is Jemmie_2004.
Also give them a foot massage.
dont be a pansy simply let it all out whats the most exceedingly awful that could happen
Any bf who calls an old bf, is not worth giving a qualm as well.
Simply appreciate being a child for the present moment, on the off chance that you are youthful.
Furthermore, take classes and make yourself occupied .
This implies the person most likely likes you as well.
This is a person who one knows, likes, and trusts.
You should get the ring back and if you do not, you can file a lawsuit against her to get it back.
I believe Shag & Velma are friends who have some intimate times on occasion.
Wait, I really do not.
If he is really your best friend, you should not be ashamed to tell him anything.
You can just say, "I have never loved you."
You can delete your yahoo profile, I've done it a few times, you must not see the selection on the screen. Good luck.
If she keeps repeating it, you should leave her.
Honestly this chatroom is a place to escape, to be someone that you're not.
If you want him back then you should start communicating with him.
Can you please post more about love and romance?
Do you think he's being honest?
There's nothing wrong with liking another person... it's natural.
Flip a coin, or choose option 3.
Just keep your eyes open, but go on with your life.
Your mother should be able to trust you.
If it is for love then there is nothing wrong.
Who would you enjoy spending time with?
Speak to him first and then decide if you should break up.
Unlike them, I do not think he is ugly.
(Nevertheless, they still cannot speak as infants)
Generally, I endure until I'm finished and then I wait for a few minutes.
Find the person you could live with, but I believe that if he keeps cheating then he is not going to stop.
Awkard-fun... Is this hyphenated, contrived word okay to use?
Think intently, consider your options, your life will not change, you must make the correct choice.
I identify as bisexual.
If you do it, it could end up being an unfortunate situation.
Come on, it is her life, you need to think about your life.
I know that we can't be graphic but consider an adult shop.
It was in the movies when I was 15, I don't think I want to explain what happened.
Women do it too.
He's been cheating on her with 3 other women.
Getting married is the cure. You'll be happy an never lonely again.
If she's your step cousin it's okay.
She isn't already married.
Time after time it will cease.
Well, if you don't like her then don't date her.
If he had the courage to burn you with a cigarette, then move on.
Is she holding her head high?
What I would like you to do.
You should show interest in him then.
Next, spend time with the man.
I can rest now that you have revealed to me that I am wasting time.
I now know that Shangri La Mactan has a location.
First I tend to feel emotional. Then I end up getting angry.
I'm not sure. I just want the points. I'm laughing out loud.
It's going to be difficult, but don't think of the negatives.
I've worked so hard to be in the position that I'm in today. You folks helped me realize that.
However, I think that she loves me as well.
Only if they are both from different schools.
It kept him from coming too quick.
Do not get married. Do not even have a serious relationship with a woman.
I do not like "bad boys." They are called "bad" for a reason.
Tell her you love her; be sweet. Also, when you have intercourse, ask her what she enjoys.
No, not unless you're okay with sharing your husband.
A girl is claiming my boyfriend cheated with her and got her pregnant.
I suggest saying you want to see it, too, but have no one to go with.
You need to mature.
Nowhere. You need to find something better to do with your time.
My boyfriend is familiar with this task, since he does it often.
I want to be honest with you. You need to stop taking everything so seriously.
To rephrase: what type of characteristics do girls females look for in males?
Send your photo to bunjeez@yahoo.com. I am single as well.
Don't believe what you read in pornographic magazines and films.
If she was not in love, she would not hurt this much.
Anybody can truly be in love regardless of how young or old they are.
I am truly in love with my girlfriend.
If you spent your time more wisely you would not feel left out.
You are toying with danger and are aware of it.
A girlfriend will only squander your time and money.
If you must ask the question the answer will be no.
Give her an unfamiliar gift, then introduce a new distraction.
Especially if it's a wife receiving love from her husband.
Tell her how you feel, and ask her nicely.
I know you like it by the sounds you make.
If you are going to the Okefenokee Swamp then let me know!
Because there are very few of them left.
Treat yourself well because you deserve it.
Kiss her neck and suck on her breast.
These are some signs which I hope will help you.
Be yourself and talk about many things:  religion, family, and the future.
You will be aware if it is the right man.
Most likely you can mention it to her a few days later, she will understand.
I have one rule, I don't need people who don't need me.
You have to get your life back.
It is bad enough currently, don't make it any worse.
I never have a problem meeting either guys or girls because we are both bi sexual.
If you say yes, it means you do not already like someone else.
If someone has a great smile that usually is a plus.
I don't think its necessary to worry about the guy stuff.
Do you think it is a good decision to become a homewrecker, and tear their family apart?
There is a girl I intensely desire, and I need help pursuing her.
Well it is your decision, however I would wait if I were you.
Will it help to improve sexual relations?
Trusting me is easy, only be charming and that alone is all that is required.
Tell her why you're unsatisfied without her.
There is no need to hurry.
If you love him, you can forgive him, but you will not forget.
I would not say that sex has multiple meanings.
There is no reason not to entertain her.
Best wishes as you navigate being both friends and lovers.
I do not really know, but I think I heard someone mention it was around six and a half.
Do not be a stalker that is outside.
I home I marry a person just like you!
Would you go on a date with me?
Yes, I have a very attractive boyfriend!
Nevertheless, it remains your decision.
And discovered it can be lovely.
(I cannot stop crying) I require assistance.
Simple edit your profile then a screen appears and shows your profiles.
It is not romance at the office, it is exchanging sex for money.
I think you should wait till you get married because who knows if it will workout.
Don't let him say that to you. That is not love.
Well the difference between being in love and not being in love is very small.
I'll start it again after this and then I'll finish it.
But mostly because they are scum and deserve to die in the fire of hell with cactuses up their butts.
Weather it is a guy or a girl.
A dear friend of mine is getting married in a week and I am seeking assistance in getting a wedding gift.
If I were to choose, I would rather choose my best friend instead of this gentleman.
I hope that I have been of some assistance, good luck in future endeavors.
No, the situations are different.
A lady is not all about her cleavage.
A long weekend to paradise.
He should only have you, hope this helps you!
Plus, you will be doing your brother a favor because she is going to hurt him more one day.
Maybe you should try to be more open.
You know what love is if you love the Lord.
The sex was so good that it made her cry.
You are either really young or middle-aged.
I am attempting to be optimistic in this stuation.
You may experience penile problems.
A history of infidelity is indicative of future behavior.
A man of my acquaintance has intimated that I am hitting on him.
Men typically are attracted to breasts and buttocks, so having one should cause you no anxiety.
Demand honesty and leave if he won't give it to you.
Have you ever been in a relationship or friendship without trust?
I don't care much for rhythm and blues but I do enjoy rhythm and poetry.
If she claims that she has changed, you should trust but verify.
You are at an age where you can't know the consequences of falling in love and to act on such a strong emotion.
Sometimes you just have to ask them for yourself.
To quote an old commercial - what happens next is entirely up to you.
No, if you are a hot woman, then he will never dump you.
When the DJ asked for her husband she handed him a phone saying "Here Baby."
Don't listen to what these other people are saying, get your ring back!
He has been drug free for over a year now.
It is surely a great feeling!
I am aware that he has something on the competition and good luck to you.
I am doing okay considering I have been up for 2 days answering questions.
I hope you do not always have to do those same things and you are able to kick it up a notch.
WHY CAN WE NOT JUST HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
Be that as it may, don't you merit better then a person why should willing offer a commentment?
Well u have most likely been prohibited or it might be your age.
On the off chance that she is truly going to execute herself then why might you be with somebody who is that way?
Right dependably comes when you wouldn't dare hoping anymore to come
Many men play like they are bad boys but are only acting to try to get the woman they are attracted to.
A simple girlfriend sunday consists of whipped cream and cherries.
He acts as if he has contempt for me.
Also when you make a lot of money.
This is due to most attractive women being self absorbed and needing someone to always reassure them they are attractive.
All guys want one thing and are gay.
I would not worry about her if I were you.
Is it worth it to wait so long?
If you just do some of them that will be good.
I love to hear it every time she tells you she loves you!
I also have two children and I was addicted to methamphetamine for three years.
You should stop lying and spend time with people who care about you.
If you want fun, then you can, but if you want a serious relationship you need to get to know him.
Do not be pushy after you kiss her because some girls do not like that!
Making love and nothing else until it is morning.
The Caribbean and Bahamas are beautiful islands, You will really enjoy the atmosphere.
Some women prefer the with bad reputations because there seem to be more of them available.
It differs from people to people, but for me western girls are the best.
Not age appropriate for diapers.
An amazing guy versus the man that you want more.
Just relax and take it easy!
All men are not very nice.
Tell him if it is a boy, Dustin, and if it is a girl, Meghan or Caroline.
If you truly love each other, than age should not be an issue.
Dress nicely, be good looking, and have a great personality.
Do not even think your feet are cute and wear open toed shoes if your feet are a mess!
Find out if he still likes you and then give it a try because he may be worth it.
That is not true because I just broke up with him for being awful.
It is much too early to make that kind of promise at age 16.
How can you love four women at once?
You should break up with him if he does not keep his promises.
I do this whenever I can.
That never hurts.
You should always do what is best.
There is infinite time and other people.
It may be an issues with your boss.
Maybe he is unsure if you like him.
No, you are a consistantly disloyal person that craves love from others.
It is your choice if you want to move on.
The same position I am in. I never say the two evil words though, "just friends", they will both leave you.
Forget the experience and continue on with your life.
In his or her arms, no matter where you are.
And some people, men and women, once a cheater, always a cheater.
Yes, small women are very attractive.
I had a sexual encounter with my brother's girlfriend last week.
No matter what, you never forget about a person you had strong feelings about.
I have not seen my parents since I was young because my father was an alcoholic.
Strip off all your clothes and tell me the time and place.
My boyfriend was not truthful with me and in my opinion, males are stubborn because they are immature!
It is not just about the answers.
My 15 year old best friend is in love.
Although the pretty lady at the gym is married, she may have a sister or friend.
I would be truthful to her.
I am guessing she does not want to change.
I neither need nor want one, but I do want more people.
I do not believe in making myself vulnerable.
Now, I am glad I have stayed.
Normally, I would say she needs to confront her father, but she is sixteen years old.
I would not say, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
You have to make your own way, not anyone else's.
Did she actually give you the right number?!
Now, where would you find that kind of woman?
How well do you know your current boyfriend?
Yes, like the big dog said, it is up to you.
You need to talk to him about it and leave if he continues to abuse you.
That happened to me last summer.
Most of the time they are smiling at another part of my body and not my face.
Act like you don't really care about it.
When there is a great love between a husband and a wife.
You are not stupid, it is natural to have the emotional attachment because both of you shared your deepest feelings.
I know my boyfriend and I have fun trying different types of condoms.
Do you know if he has feelings for you and if he has feelings, are the the same?
Am I too sensitive or is he just not right for me?
This girl at youth group is constantly courting others.
It should taper off between thirty and forty years from now.
My advice is to wait until after, it will be worth the wait. I did not wait, and I later came to regret it.
I hope it turns out well. Do not send him an anonymous note, though.
Keep the relationship romantic, regardless of family responsibilities.
I do want to have my chance but maybe I should just wait?
Why don't you invite him to come on some group outing?
That is just a big pile of crap.
Just be a gentleman and ask if they won't use them.
And you do not have to have sex with someone to get someone to like you.
When you do find a mate, make sure you are having safe sex.
Yes, I would like to go with you.
She is not faithful to her mate, and vice-versa.
Well, I am not an expert, but, I have been in love before.
If you desire him, pursue him and stop being irresolute.
You were injured before and desire to harm them before you are harmed again.
Yes, abandon this man and start a relationship with an ideal man confident is his love for women.
"No, of course not.", I think, but her actions are based on the person she's with.
I pursued romance with a friend and had a brief a relationship.
The phenomenal taste can be felt after thinking like him.
Please do not hesitate to tell me anything.
Have sex only when you are ready.
If you cannot stop thinking about him.
What if he approached her and not you?
I know exactly what you mean.
Causing you to break into pieces.
You are still young, do not be so hasty.
If your boyfriend is smoking then leave him.
Sex with someone you love that knows how to do it.
In about one week, I will realize I am in love.
My ex displayed the same behavior which resulted in our breakup.

Well, you ought to tell your mother, because your father might try to kill you. Trust me.

I am romantically attracted to a man from a different state so how can I invite his company with finesse?
If she is expressing the sentiment of you being everything to her, end the relationship.

My husband is similar to most of the men he works with.
I am an available 22 year old single person who just ended a relationship.
Love is unconditional and things will work themselves out.
I want to express to you that we can always be friends.
After he speaks with the girls, make sure you can read the conversation.
Do not think that, it's not true.
I do no know what else to say. I am sorry.
Even if they will not admit it to their friends.
I tried to let go but it did not work, I am so in love with her.
You should go out with him if you like him.
How can I tell him that I want to be his friend, not his girlfriend?

Stress can ruin everything if you let it control you.
Life is too short for the foolishness.
The man of my dreams is out there somewhere.
You can do anything you want to, you are free.
No, actually you are not unintelligent.
See what he thinks about you.

Just because you encounter some self-centered men does not mean all men are like that.

Where does she enjoy visiting?
In regards to popular opinion, do women lie when discuss love?
Everything is okay Mother, please go ahead with your decisions.

Perform an action that will attract her to approach you.
Then, you ought to decide or, at least, it shall provide for an easier decision.
Frankly, I attempted to cease favoring him because no male is worth losing a friendship, correct?
I would ask myself, though, "Why can he not speak with me?"

When it comes to looks, sometimes, but not everything else.
It involved silly string, we will just have to talk about that later.
Tell her to not do it, they have no clue what they are doing if you understand what I am saying.
If you're an emotional person, I would recommend against it.
I feel that you have not found that special someone yet.
You do not have to.
If he likes her better than you, then he is not worth your time. You should find a new man.
Be prepared to be incredibly disappointed.
Find something that will elevate your boyfriend's position.
Only the arrogant people who think themselves better than everyone else.
Someone who would be great company.

Give your girlfriend, some flowers, a card, and a box of candy.
Tell your boyfriend, you're ready to settle down for the sake of your child.

I shall reiterate, This gentleman was genuinely my definition of handsome!
You need to inquire of him regarding an escalation of the situation, alright?
Let me test my understanding, The gentleman in question is your boyfriend but went out with your friend later?
I suppose.  Because they are extremely intelligent and very irritation, of course!
Avoid generalizations by saying an Irish woman is an excellent wife, life is not quite so simple.
And she keeps telling me that my boyfriend and I are on this supposed website.
He said he had forgotten about her, but in reality he remembered her.
(At the time we were still courting; now we've been married sixteen years.)
If you give him what he desires, he will not leave you.
I know that I need to respect her and give her time alone.

You have to be determined to loose the weight.
Check the book out of the library and read it alongside him.
Most people do not care what race you are, so they will just ask you.
He would want to move in and live there for free.
When you are searching for yours, you need to pray.
Only to have less to think about.
It depends on who you would rather be around.

So yeah, anyway, to cut the long story, I think you should go for it.
I do not know how he feels and I can not talk to him.
On the main page of Yahoo website, click on all the Ys with exclamation points.

If you give her another call it will show her how interested you are.
Not me. Why are you asking?
First and foremost, take your cues from someone that is special to you.
I do not agree, love can sometimes be depressing.
Ever since the break up, I have not been around him when he hadn't been crying.
It's been a while since i've had a relationship, but I'm ready for one
Get him a mug with the picture of you two on it.
I'm sorry I was unable to help.
If you decide to do it, just have fun with it.
Because if she becomes angry.
My motto is once unfaithful, always unfaithful.
Do not say something clearly, but rather something where it catches her off guard but is not scary.  Why?
I am in love with someone addicted to crack-cocaine.

Here is my question: I betrayed my best friend nine months ago.
He still walks past you frequently, though.
Take off all his clothes and use erotic jargon.
Why not go to yahoo messenger and find the chatroom?
It all depends on what type of person you personify.
Can a man and woman who have been friends, then in a relationship, be friends again?

Either way, take a chance and tell him, something good may come out of it!
Otherwise try the German section of Yahoo personals.
How alluring they are wearing skin tight jeans and cowboy boots.

This will ruin your friendship.
Do you wish to be incarcerated?
I do not know what other men do.
Good luck; I wish you well.

You are too young to experience the outside world in a way a woman does.
A female has a right to her own autonomy.
Often times individuals become inflamed at others.
However, if you still care to be with him you need to.
My previous lover works with a man that I admire.
If you have done that for a while, you will not be rising as you formerly were.
Here is some advice: do not lose your virginity if you are young unless you are in love and engaged to the person.
That is a horrible situation to be in.
My husband and I have four children and we met in an AOL chat room.
No, it can go either way.
Why not just ask? What would be the worst thing to happen if you did?
You ought to make sure you are committing to the right person.
Provide your contact e-mail here and see who you might want to communicate with.
I have long believed it would be fun to organize a huge celebration for Groundhog Day instead of Valentines' Day.
You can try to be friends with her if you want. It might not stay that way for long, though.
Did you love each other at one point?
I do not know what you should do now, though.
I have seen a couple of your answers and you always seem to say it best!
Fifteen guys picking you up at the same time is inappropriate.
Keep it interesting. Wear sexy lingerie on occasion.
In order to communicate you might want to try myspace.com or a yahoo.com chat room.
You will find some gentlemen have trouble communicating by telephone.
My preference is brunette women, but there are some attractive ones with blonde hair, as well.
Say you have to attend a party which is being thrown by a distant relative.
A smart and confident man is highly attractive.
Provided they are mature enough to handle someone who is older than them then it is fine.
Busy yourself so that you do not have time to think of somebody who is not thinking of you the same way.
I am sure any woman would appreciate this.
My ex-husband and I are friends and his wife is unhappy about the friendship.
It sounds as though you are in a lot of pain.
If you have any plans, could you reveal them now?
It seems that everyone wants to have a significant other who is loyal even though they may be flirtatious themselves.
I hope that I responded to your questions without showing my lack of knowledge.
I know several attractive smart people.
It is all right. Age is only a number. You should continue.
Women enjoy dogs, cats, cute items, children, and some enjoy classic cars and motorcycles.
Ignore that man and allow me a chance.
Something inside of me suggested that if I valued my life, I should run away.
If you placed a hand on him first then he has a right to retaliate.
If you discover she does not then you, at the very least, can move on.
I am not sure, but they say that once they cheat, they will always cheat.
On either your birthday or his/her birthday.
No it is not cheating, both of you are just acting as friends.
Just be true to yourself and the right guy will reveal himself.
And most of the time, he calls me just to say hello and goodnight.
But I do not know the answer to the other question.
Being different should not determine who you are.
If guys want something from women, they should be honest and straight forward.
If a woman does not make you happy, you should move on.
Finding the right one for you takes time and patience.
Darling, please do not lose yourself over a guy!
Also, they want to impress their friends.
It's always smart to send flowers and chocolates.
Feel free to email me at sammy710@hotmail.com.
Just friends who have experienced a lot.

Listen, if you have feelings for her just express it to her.
I get about seven to twelve per day.
I am not interested in what you are saying.
Just phone me when he returns home.
I am aware because I am in charge!
And if she is anything like me, it does not have to be the $75.00 plus a dozen roses package!
I hope it works out for you!
Whatever you do, do it out of love for your family, if anything.
That moment when you are having a conversation or something, amd the wrong name comes out.
They are not computer addicts, I get that vibe from those types.
Basically this means that intercourse is always best when it is with someone you love!
I agree with the what the woman above said: it goes both ways.
Now we can reconcile and be friends once again.
Or maybe she is seeing someone else.
I did not care that he dumped me a week after a bad kiss.
I am both a good girl and a bad one,if you know what I mean.
I am single and I know everyone I talk to is not single also.
It was near puberty.
I believe they should know more about you.
Even nerds are hot also, you know that?
Yes, I do just enough to get a divorce from an abusive one.
I came to realize that I made a mistake, but it was a little too late.
The way you move with him is okay, up until now.
Everyone thought it was the best wedding ever!
I am becoming exasperated with this question.
Offering him oral sex if he needs release.
I do not believe either his sister or his mother likes me, and that is a problem for me.
Break up with your boyfriend and get to know the cute one!
That is a tough situation you are in!
If he wishes to talk why does he not sit down and talk with you, his wife?
If know how to kiss then go for it.
I agree with Virgo that thirteen is my answer to when you are ready.
They have no mutual friends and are unhappy.
Currently, financial value is the main priority followed by love.
This is merely my opinion, therefore you should engage in a course of action you feel is appropriate.
You will accomplish a ruined friendship and nothing else then what will you do?
You need to merely dominate him in a conflict and inform him of your feelings.
You may understand the look you and your husband share with each other.
If you are a guy please click on the question that says any attractive 13-15 year old guys out there?
After my boyfriend and I had sex, things were awkward, but now it is fine.
You are the man in the relationship, so make it known if you want her back.
You get to marry the only woman you've ever kissed!
People should not say that Jesus Christ was against sex before marriage because he never said a word about it.
Thank you for the answers to my quesions earlier.
Girl's love the sensation they get from their g-spot which is inside their vagina.
Their are women who hate sex.
They probably do if they were popular back then.
I hope to be single for a short period of time.
If you follow your heart, it will lead you in the right direction.
She needs you now more than ever.
If you ask me, it is pretty stupid.
Once a liar, they will always be a liar.
No, I am not going to say we do!
Basically, it just depends on the people it is happening to.
Once a liar, they will always be a liar.
Obtain your own home and bed if you intend to be sexually active.
Take care of yourself and use the great power within your soul.

However, I engage in sexual relations only with my wife.
Look for a different guy, he is a homosexual.

If it's a younger guy, age 19, then I'm the one.

It is enjoyable to watch, though some may find it annoying.

Yes, some are beautiful and others are not.
I was planning to date his best friend, but then I grew interested in my former boyfriend again.

I would not have a problem with that.

I am not but thank you for the points because I am closer to level three!

Give him time to think, but live your life in the meantime and do not worry about him.
Do you still think of the one thing you are in love with?
You just need to go for it, that will show your ex what he is missing.
If you see his true self, and you are being your true self and you are still drawn together, that is love.
Try to be frinds with him first, then then the attraction will come.
Do it in your own bedroom.
I really dislike it when men attempt to buy me a gift or do so without asking me first.
Would you or have you ever logged on to GGW?
Be brave and tell him that directly or never bring it up again.

And she irritates me very deeply.
I am young,19, and a man of honor lol
Dark, WHITE, GREEN, YELLOW, AS LONG AS HE IS GOOD TO ME...
Kinda modest about asking in any case need see who else is searching for some good times.
That is the reason companions do moronic things.
I simply feel that im okay looking.
Why did she get into that business?
You have an easier time befriending men because other women consider you competition.
Do you think he is interested in me?
Consider what you did to make him interested in you and stay with you.
Besides, he was unfaithful to the both of us.
If you are younger in age, three days may pose a problem. Otherwise there are no issues.

We have been married for 15 years and are still going strong!
I am talking about a 3-7 year age difference.

I was in my own way after thinking about it.
I cannot watch that kind of stuff because it is too expensive.
You have to sit on his lap during the movie, and steal kisses from him.

Show him that you are over him and that you deserve better.
I would say yes, but, I am really sensitive to things of that nature.
It does not matter how people look at you.
I would not do that because you can get an STD.
Jerry would be the best idea.
Try to relax and not worry, just be yourself.
It's better when you don't have to ask.
It is all about who the person is, not what they like.
If he answers to the positive, you should let him know that the relationship is over.
Do you see you and your boyfriend being like that?
Just relax and don't go too fast.
As you said, she is more than likely confused right now.
You have to tell them that you think they are beautiful.
I hope that the results of your decision are advantageous.
I am of the impression that they rarely provide us false information.
Would it be advantageous to let him know that I fancy him?
She has been my friend for over two years when I finally told her that I was in love with her.
I was 22 years old when I kissed my lover's lips.
I agree, it may be cheating.
No, unless you are to question the situation, despite it being uncomfortable.
You may join R. J. Kelly and Michael Jackson as alleged famous child molesters.
Despite researching for an extensive time frame, no one is approving of me; I would like to truly relax.
I concur with Kittie in that the situation is incorrect.
I am also fond of my neighbor, but you should slow down.
While I know that it is possible, I am unsure how to do it.
The most accurate thing I can say is you should get a backbone.
You should always keep in mind that simply because she is in love with him, he may not reciprocate those feelings.
Ill behaved men are simply just that.
Women, indeed, do care about money.
He calls me on my phone. He also asked me to dance and I accepted.
Most guys are obvious, like you, and will say so, but other guys will not be so obvious.

Two wrongs do not make a right.
If I like him, I will start talking to him and then draw closer if I am enjoying the conversation.
You should try to reconcile with her for Valentine's Day.
If you smile at him, and he reacts, he might be interested.
However, I would have to say that it was perfect.
Visit a store specializing in sexual merchandise and purchase some toys for sexual use.
He does not possess the right to issue ultimatum so command him to leave.
Tell him very thoroughly by providing hints and appearing more physically attractive than normal while showing your true nature.
Young lady, you must take care of the issue yourself.
In they respond negatively they do not wish to do so.
But he told you about it, meaning he felt bad and regretted it. In addition, you do love him.
I got married just after graduating from high school.
I did want to be in a relationship with him, though.
You should stop letting him use you at his leisure. It is time to do something else with your life, friend.
Yes, I cannot see anything wrong with that.
He could possibly be, but also, maybe he isn't.
I wouldn't not be the appropriate person to give that advice, I am a virgin.
Women with a good sense of humor are the best.
That may be a cause of it.
If he is agreeable to it, then you should put yourself into int.
No that will most likely not work out.
Just because he no longer attends church, doesn't make him bad.
I don't think you're old enough to have sex.
If you would like to ask him to the movies, just ask.
What do I have to do to make her feel?
You must enjoy being the second person to engage in sexual relations, although you must end your relationship and be realistic quickly.
Do not focus on a desire you can not fulfill.
This was me until a point 17 years ago.
Every person should love and if they do not, you do not concern yourself with them.
I agree, if he is pleasant, supportive, and physically attractive.
If she could get pregnant,  it would prove bad for the relationship.
That is the way I see it anyway.
You should have a sit down with her, or write her a letter.
I would like to how to go about that.
Should I keep talking with her, or should I let he go?
You might be in some trouble.
A woman can have a completely different personality behind closed doors.

I find it very childish, but the problem is that I love him so much.
No, because you two are not together anymore.
Funny, caring, and good looking, someone who says I am pretty, not hot.
Oh yes, Latins are hot and as a lover, satisfy.
You mean B.O.B.: Battery Operated Boyfriend.
Evidently he falls really easy, but you have to be the judge of that one.
I do not like these questions.

A woman would be crazy to email you, because what kind of man does that.
I liked you before we even went on a date.
You spent a day with another guy having intercourse.
Please do not make the same mistake again.
However, I am an overweight and impolite lesbian.
I am simply not sure what it is that you are searching for here.
Do not make false statements. Tell the man that you are bored.
Having money and a nice car do not hurt your chances!
Knowing he loves you is a good thing.
It is good that he wants to spend time with you.
There is a cab around the corner waiting for you.
You do not know, he could be a weirdo or murderer.
I do not like olives.
That is quite repellent. I believe that it is not true love because it is flatulence.
There is one waiting for you shortly.
Preposterous. You could truly be dating a menacing murderer!
I despise olives, but some men love them!
What if he gets mad and wants nothing to do with you?
It would be a good idea not to tease him.
In high school they are still acting like fools to get the attention of girls.
You called him a boy and I am guessing you already have the answer.
When you don't want one, you don't see the interests of others as well.
Tell your family that you love them and be happy.

Darling, you are looking in all the wrong places because I am right here.
I asked, "What present should I give a guy?", both of the answers were oral sex.

Nothing is worth taking your own life for it.
How the guy looks would not be a big deal, but his personality would matter .
You talk to him quite a bit.
It is not as if you slept with another man while you were still with him.
"Ask" is not the best place to get this information.
That means staying only long enough to reel you back in!
And so my final answer would be a resounding "no".
Some men are afraid, other men are involved in relationships.
Young lady, I believ you need to stop, but that is my belief.
Approach him and ask " Do you still desire me, or is there someone else?".
If not, then sit down with him and discuss your feelings.

Some people must look out for their own interests, and he is one you should not help.
Could he be serious? Do not be blind by nice words, forever is a long time.
Oysters and pumpkin seeds by the hand full.
I agree with sunflower, if you had wanted to be with him you would not have cheated.
Do not wait until after, that would be rude.
His or your's I do not know.
A man's word indicates his character.
That'd be amusing, but the girl ought to be his fiancee.
He's only interested in carnal pleasures.
I feel that I am a good lover.
In truth, if this man cannot see how beautiful you are, then he is not worthy of you.
Have you considered whether or not you truly like this man or if you merely want revenge?
I think he truly loves you now so when you are alone ask him or call him.
I once went on a date with a very attractive young woman.
You are your own woman. If he believes that is being unfaithful, then that is his loss.

However, I have dated women and they are capable of lunacy.

Additionally, you are an exceptional sexual partner if you both climax simultaneously.
If he has been in love three times, did he lose his love because of a death, or because of the end of a relationship?
I suggest you ask her, and when you decide to ask her use compassion in your voice and make eye contact.
If the picture gives you discomfort then why would you not tell him?
Therefore, I wish my best for both of you!
It is possible that he may not want her to be in a relationship with you, and how is that?
If I dated someone simply based upon their appearance (which I do not), I would probably find myself ending the relationship.
That's rather stereotypical, wouldn't you say?
Then he thinks I am pretending.
I must admit it: you could stand to lose him.
Keep in mind that if you attempt to reach him at some point and he already has it, he could still always have two of it.
You have to think about who you like more, or do not date either of them and pick some one else.
You need to get rid of your past demons (why do you not like women?).
So I am guessing the sex will not either.
Have you ever even heard of that Sir-Mix-A-Lot song?

Even with love, it is the same as some huge contest.
Sorry, I couldn't tell you the signs because I missed them.
I would do the same thing.

Well yes if he had a good explanation.
Girl, I doubt that it is going to be a problem in the future.

I would not want to have to wait.
When it comes to emotions, men just do not show it.
And to have what you want with a real person.
Perhaps it was him, and he had no other way to tell you that.
It takes trust on both sides.

If that is the case, then yes!

You would need to categorize this question to get a direct answer.
Yes, I hope you know him. It is only dating.
Try having sex without: one, thinking about it; two, listening to it; or three, thinking about it.

It means he loves himself more than he loves you.
Set up the bar similar to the speakeasy fashion.

Men wearing boxers appear similar to young boys
On occasion, I believe a small number of men intentionally seek a woman who will treat them poorly.
However, it is acceptable if their ages are forty and forty-three.
I agree, I experience the same problem.
You must always be aware of a woman's need to believe you are listening to her.
You should purchase her something meaningful, something that she doesn't already own.
It would be ill-advised to have a sexual relationship with that type of person.
Yes, I am myself when I am around her. However, I would like for her to perceive me differently. Do you have any suggestions?
When you least expect it to, it will occur.
With me, it is either all, or nothing.

I believe most males notice the internal beauty of a female first.
If he is the one you prefer, stay with him.

This is the best I can come up with.
Food, and the best romantic soundtrack.
Let's begin from there, so do that home girl.
Maybe you should ask yourself, "Why am I curious about this?"

I simply recently informed him that I had a partiality towards him.
Not if her male paramour is around or an envious individual.
Ah, yes, do not forget to swallow.
To each, their own, but for what reason?
Engage yourself with activities, there by distracting your attention from him.
Request the status of his affiliation to you.
To sacrifice your favorite pastimes for a man warrants pity.
She proceeded to converse with that gentleman.
If you assist them, age is irrelevant.
Yes, if you are into BSDM.
Ok, girls like it when you make them seem special. So, tell her.

Guess what will happen if you think that way?
So, they get mad because they don't feel like they can as easily.
Also, men mature later then women.
It depends on what you mean by a phone relationship.
I'm really tired of these women who think that if you're not thin or tight, you're a joke.
First of all, you aren't a screw up.
I am not promiscuous, but luckily I am not a virgin either.
Rest assured, it is not always the woman.
In other words, my entire life.
If it kept happening, I'd eventually confide in my friend.
If he did, he would not have been unfaithful in the first place.
Most men have a tendency of using someone.
Men have a tendency of visually seeking out a female rather than what is in their hearts.
There is much more to come.
When you are in love with your spouse you are accepting of their faults.
What is it that a male is contemplating as he gazes into your eyes nightly?
Talkin to your woman is the best advice that I can give you.
Look around, there are beautiful women all around you. You have to decide if you're looking for inner beauty or outter beauty.
Do you want to find your lost friend?
There is nothing to be afraid of, get out there and do what needs to be done.
It will feel like lightening hit you.
Once you mature, you may come back to each other.
How appealing you are, and how fast he recognizes you.
How does she shake her hips, and turns her head?
Ask her what she enjoys doing on the weekends.
It will not happen, because men dislike desperation.
Does it not amaze you what money can accomplish?
Even though he says he is not afraid?
Go ahead, unless it is on the cheeks.
Some do, but not all the way.
It is not going to happen, because guys hate desperation.
Is it amazing what money can do?
Even if he says differently, he is afraid.
Unless it is on the cheeks, then go ahead.
Some do, but not all.
If he can't cooperate, then file for a divorce.
Yes, because we usually have intercourse.

I think boxers look outdated.
I will not label any necessary thing as "should be".
If you and him are truely friends, then you must know his address. You should go there and get the details.
Now, he is acting completely uninterested in me, saying things like, "I used to love you."
If you are certain, let her go.
Do you think she is attracted to you?
It is such a common trait that I wouldn't call it weird.
Those are the signs of a man interested in a relationship.
Why not try asking her out? Perhaps to a movie or something?
Yet, when a man calls you on the phone, you do not answer or return the call. What kind of behavior is this?
I am not sure if I can still marry her.
She should also return your things, unless you told her they were gifts.
And are low enough to convince him to leave his wife.
And, intelligence is what I prefer in a woman.

How can I get his answer to be yes?
What would you like to do?
They loved their mother dearly.
I believe that my husband and my sex life is much better than before we got married.
It does not matter how old you are, only when the time is right.
Men and women alike come in all shapes and sizes.
Whoever accepts you, they are lying.
I wouldn't call them a friend.
A lot of girls all over the world.
For the virgin girls out there, great job.
No, that is not repugnant, but that is not something that you desire to speak to others.
Indeed, you merely need to have caution.
It has been three years, and I love him fiercely.
Is she truly your most significant companion?
All you have to do is "inform" your wife that you are a worthy husband.
Yes, look at my case, I apologize.
I have to say blue looks better on other items.
I don't know, you're about 21 when you finish school.
It is normal, and men like it.
You broke up for some reason.
Well friend, it sounds like she is very important!
The boy I told you I liked came to my house today.
She needs to know you both need other friends.
Not all are jerks, they just need to step out from behind their egos and grow up.
Yes, it is nothing to avoid.
Unless you are twenty and the other person is fifteen, then that is not good in my opinion.
At the end, just point to the bed and you know what to do then.
I prefer the black and chrome.
If you are doing it too fast, you should slow down.
Most of them are very unattractive.
There are not many good ones these days.
To meet ladies, get dates, and to hang out.
Being in love makes you defy reasoning.
My next wedding will be outside in the Spring with a lot of flowers on a beautiful lawn.
If you desire to ruin your relationship, then go ahead.
There is a girl I know who the sex is terrible with.
Do not date the sadist; tell him to leave you alone.
More of the silent type, or the more active one?
IM GLAD THAT YOU HAVE FOUND SOMEONE THAT MAKES YOU TRUELY HAPPY.
LIVING WITH YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER IS FINE AS LONG AS YOU ARE HELPING OUT.
THINK I SHOULD LET MY BOYFRIEND KNOW THAT IM GOING TO THE CONCERT.
IF YOU KNOW WHAT SHE LIKES GET HER THAT.
YOUR YOUNG SLOW DOWN AND ENJOY YOURSELF.
Get rid of everything that reminds you of this guy.
Even if you do not date until you are out of school, who cares?
Pray when it seems like Jesus is not listening, pray some more. I have been there.
I would probably get tired of it.
If you do not feel right, then do not do it.
If he was interested, do you think he would act tired?
Yes. I would like to do a foursome with you involved.
Do not let it get to your head.
Why would you want a man that would leave his wife for you, or anyone else?
Maybe he has been hurt before, and is afraid that you will hurt him too.
Please do not lose that, it is a nice thing to have.
My advice is, tell him the truth, and hope he receives it well.
Although I am sort of shy at first, I am completely comfortable, once I get to know someone.
It is because they dislike being corrected.
There are plenty more guys that you can focus on.
When you fell from Heaven, what did you say?
It depends on how long you have been dating.
If you really love them, give them a leader with discipline and strenght.
As you've mentioned, you will get your desire, if you're like that.
It's over, so break it off totally.
Don't be obliged, if you want to go for long, I am pondering if he does as well.
It will much more fun than before.
Women are not blind, we see much.
You seem to lack some self-assurance.
The female that he fancies, is my best friend?
If he pulls out and claims he was not aware that the condom broke, then he's probably lying.
Just wait until you are older and then perhaps she will like you!
There is nothing wrong in trying, since many, including you, are there for fun.
I am married and see my wife only twice a week, when it is necessary.
Yes, I do love blue, but also hot pink and lime green!
However, if she does not like you?
That girl does not deserve you, you should break-up with her.
If she does not, you may want to tell her.
I would say that you should, because they are fund and you get a chance to travel around the world.
It does hurt when the person you like wants someone else, and shows it.
They are married now and/or have kids.
I believe he is cheating on me, but there's no proof, just an intuitive feeling.
You know you should end the relationship.
Don't use a coat hanger!
Do not be too shy to answer the question.
Additionally, though something may be legal does not mean it is right.
He does know she is not intelligent, correct?
Girls are like candy.  The cover can be compared to virginity, so you should be a virgin!
Please get this jerk caught because he is very bad!
You know he is interested if he flirts a lot with you, and if he pays a lot of attention to you.
When you feel the kiss, you can kiss.
Guys have short hair and girls have long hair.
Excuse me, miss, I can't help to think that I know you from somewhere.
Imbecile, respond to me if you understand me.
I am a girl, I am in this situation.
Look them in the eye, be honest, humorous, and slightly flirtatious.
Essentially inform him you are favoring him, and feelings are uncontrollable, thus, what is to come afterwards?
Because, in a sense, it is fine if a male is promiscuous, but not for a female.
Are you looking forward to getting a message from her via email or text?
You should be brave and ask him out.
You should try as hard as you can because one day she will talk again.
I am not sure, but I think you should take things slower in your relationship.
Blindfold her and take her to the top of the building.
It is your decision. Do not let other people choose your boyfriend.
The bridesmaids will buy their dresses.
My significant other had an affair but since I had done the same previously, I told him that we were even.
I cannot tell you but it lasts forever when it is love.
If you had one wife and she gave you a daughter, you would have had to try for a second child.
Lust had nothing to do with it.
However, if you are comfortable there and your parents do not mind, then sure, why not?
Actually, it is when you start asking this question.
I recommend to stop fighting and flow with it!
Share your feelings and see how she feels.
Get on one knee and apologize.
My boyfriend is in Iraq and I wanted some gift ideas for Valentine's Day.
All that you need in a relationship is for you to still like each other.
Just get what you want!
It isn't tough love or even love.
You need to forget about him.
People don't understand love.
A woman is not needed for life; however, she is needed to keep me company.
I feel like I mess up a lot.
If things are not working out, leave your husband, but don't run off with the new guy yet.
If he is willing to flirt, flirt back. Maybe you will end up together.
In my opinion, love and friendship are the same.
It is obvious that they like you for who you are, which is great.
It is time to get out and be independent.
Talk to him, and if you become good friends, tell him that you like him.
Just wait for her to return.
Where can I find some pornography?
Are you having casual sex or is it a friends with benefit type?
It is because we think differently on a lot of things.
I hope you are not a girl Trin.
I dont believe men are one or the other.
Do not change for this guy.
Yes, I am kind of going through the same thing.
Friends do not give friends lists of demands!
I am not jealous.
Hello, I am Junior and I would like to be your pen pal.
Do you want some of this black booty?
No one can be considered hot until after they are 17 years old.  Before that everyone is just cute.
I like brunettes that have long, soft hair.
I cannot put it into words.
No thank you. That was a silly question that people ask.
No it is not right and that is sad.
Some brunettes have long hair.
It is difficult to say.
Some people ask questions that do not make sense.
It is sinful and that's awful.
If you do not change some things about yourself, all guys will just use and abuse you.
If you really like the guy, then make the effort to spend time with him.
Well, I am experiencing the same thing.
If you are not currently in school, you need to move out of the house.
You do not want to get back together with your man.
They want to be mean because they believe that their husbands are mean.
Just relaz a little. Good things only come once in a lifetime, maybe twice, if we are lucky.
If they pursue a relationship together, you are going to have to move on.
I left my home the day after graduation to pursue a job opportunity.
I am twenty years old and have plenty of electronics.
You do not have to date anyone that you do not want to.
On a small Island in Hawaii on the beach during the daytime.
Also makes the kissing more exciting.
You need to ask him why his father let him date the other girl and not you.
Blue says, "I am thinking you are crazy with this".
Unless, of course, it is porn involving children. That is very wrong.
Is it wrong to fantasize about sucking cock?
I'm assuming that he really cares about me.
After you talk to her, give her time to figure out exactly what she wants.
If you are sometimes nice, I wouldn't consider you a major prep.
He is not doing all of the things that he used to do.
Yes, my husbands clothes are very comfortable!
He might, but worse he probably doesn't.
I think it is great!
Being caught with an ex can mean the end of your relationship.
Opposites attract, so it doesn't matter if you two don't have anything in common.
I would take him back, but it would take a while for me to let him come home.
If you want to get ready for love, read this book.
My friend set me up with her friend, a nurse.
When you tell him you are not ready he will respect your wishes, if he loves you.
Be more considerate and do not brush her off just because you have already told her that you want to break-up.
If you quit now, it is only going to be harder.
I would say to think and try to remember if you possibly did something.
As far as telling him that you liked him?
Because women never stop talking and are always complaining about something.
I feel heartbroken, because I am also in a long distance relationship with someone I love.
It is because good men present no challenge to women.
However, watch out for older guys, because the majority of them only want to sleep with you.
Is it that you are just not ready yet?
I am confident that my backside and legs are nice, and that I am not overweight, by any means.
Bring her some exotic flowers. Look in her eyes, and tell her how you feel.
If nothing changes, tell your best friend.
When you love someone, you don't falsify your actions just because you are with your girlfriends.
He likes it at home. He isn't ready, I'm hurt, (and I am ready)!
Oh my goodness! It is crazy that you asked that question.
Do not let him get under your skin.
Other than that, is everything is good?
I am a boy in the eighth grade, and I am fond of my friend.
Be happy you are fortunate enough to have a significant other all together.
Do not listen to others that tell you to give him a chance.
I am 17 years of age currently dating a 21 year old. The age difference is not a problem for us.
Although I do not like it, it happens to me frequently.
Everything will work out great.
We live the best we can.
So, if a girl was to cheat or express herself sexually, she would be breaking that mentality.
Average, big, huge, or "what is that thing"?
Definitely briefs, I think they are very sexy.
Also, do not date a guy to get over a different guy.
Yes, if you are a guy.
Perhaps a man is interested in you, more than just physically?
Yes I am hurt but I only flirt when, you can guess who, flirts first.
Best of luck to you, Captain Blarg, you internet aberration.
Truly, unless you realize for sure he is self-centered bigot, just ask.
I want to end our relationship because he is disrespectful to my friends.
Personality, Intelligence and also what most women refer to as the stomach.
Yes, it is less expensive.
Ask him if he has someone and if he says no, then you should ask him out.
It isn't wise to say that you are more attractive than your girlfriend.
The man has to come to the woman first.
Just look at it this way.
Good Luck, Keep your head up.
Just approach her, converse with her, and see if you all enjoy each other.
I am really smart and I am not hot, but I am not ugly either.
Go to dating sessions if you are that kind of guy(or girl, just consider that)
I do not want to just flirt with her.  I am interested in a sincere relationship.
They were hurt a little but are fine.
Wow, this man is very mean!
Are they more important to you than you are to them?
It depends on what types of guys attract you.
Your kind of love is unselfish, I respect it.
I have had bad experiences with them and advise that you stay away from them.
He was my first love and I have always kept him in my heart.
You should check and make sure that he is ok.
The man is not even creative.
The man requests an embrace from me.
You do not want a girlfrined more so than just having sexual intercourse.
You should be direct in what you request.
There are different standards between males and females in terms of sexual relationships.
How can I get this female to be attracted to me?
This is a good thing to know by the way.
So, how do I know if he has feelings for me or not?
Or, if you meant the none-perverted way, you would use salad tongs.
If it was a mistake that you had made, then you will need to apologize for it.
Not rock hard ab muscles, but it is not flab either.
I wish you the best. Remember to just be confident, honest and caring.
Blue is my favorite color. Sometimes it is associated with the feeling of sadness.
If you are a legal adult you should not have to rely on your parents so much.
Age is just a number.
It depends, do you really want to meet him?
I think that this is the incorrect answer!
When you are in love with someone you do not have eyes for anyone else.
Should I wait? Or move out?
No he might be strong in all the right areas, but he won't be around as much.
As long as you are happy, it doesn't matter what others say.
Do they like constantly flirting girls, or just occasionally flirty ones?
You need to meet Rosy Palm and her five friends.
Friends are supposed to support you and not their partner.
My sense of maternal pride is strong- even for strangers.
Simply accept the love that is available.
Purchase for her a stuffed frog with a heart on it or some other item that combines the ideas love and frogs.
You are excited and eager to enjoy yourself.
When you cease asking that question.
Because he would like to be friends with you and nothing more.
Try some clothes that flatter your thighs and buttocks.
It all depends on how the relationship is going.
Tell her exactly how you are feeling, just tell her nicely.
Number two; join him and beat him in the game.
Change nothing and love him as a friend.
I like people with good personalities.
Many males look for a female to support them.
For your information my mother moved out on her own when she graduated high school.
Men don't fight with females because women are usually more weak.
Men come and go, do not let this one ruin your friendship.
You are too young to be infatuated with a boy.
No matter how mean he is to you, do not hate!
Keep it to yourself, they do not need to know.
I don't believe so, it is near.
I understand, it's odd, but I enjoy it.
You can't decide who you love, your heart chooses.
Just ask how she feels about it.
I can't call to say something like that.
By the way, I am 17 years old, and he is as well.
OF course he will, if you let him try.
Everything about them is great; their looks, the way they carry themselves, their independence, and intelligence.
Do guys like that trait in girls?
I guess it is something that makes all girls irritated.
No, it's not love in any shape or form.
You deserve a lot more than that man.
He bounces, he shoots, he scores two points.
If it burns when you urinate it's because, I believe, you have a disease or something.
I believe he does because I hang around with tons of girls, but not necessarily the ones I enjoy.
Never open mail from a stranger.
Don't be yourself, you're embarrassing.
Ask him as if it were someone else.
Good idea, now he knows you care, so he will be thinking of you.
Are you going to spend the rest of your life with this person?
Do not cut is short, hold the conversation for a while.
I wish you the best.
She and I are still friends, and I still care about her greatly.
He asked me my address and pretended to like me.
When it comes to family, the females have that.
When she inquired, did it hurt?
I realize that this isn't too in depth, but I do hope that it helps!
Be yourself and use your style to your advantage.
Also the first time is all about the attraction.
I apologize, I do not fit into her clothing.
What I am saying is that it is hard to know if it is true love until you spend time with the person.
If you act like English royalty or Liz Hurley, you will do great!
I suggest you get even by cheating on him and I will help you.
If he really loves you, he will want to spend the rest of his life with you as well.
I do not know because I have not seen it.
I wish the both of you the best in life.
Everything that you do with him may be romantic for him, and you as well.
You were far off topic.
At least this way you have a 50% change of happiness, and I wish you luck.
That depends on how long and how well you've known them.
Her ex-boyfriend and her current boyfriend are buddies.
Do not confide in her.
If you fall in love get married.
His wife lives in an assisted living facility.
My ex-boyfriend is friends with a guy I like.
2nd, do not tell her anything anymore.
When you find someone you love and you are ready to marry.
Answer it and it is not sace our ship.
My wife is in a nursing home.
A lot of people wonder how you became so accomplished at such a young age?
Seeing a person twice a week is excessive.
Watch out and be extremely careful to avoid injury
Did I say I would think about it?
A reality love show is not what I expected from him.
You are capable of accomplishing it.
Due to the fact that he already has a lover, his game system.
I believe it is due to the fact that males are often more co-dependent than women.
Maybe for some, but not all.
I wish you the best of luck, I believe it will be fun and exciting once you walk through the door.
Remember, at all times perform the correct actions so that it will not haunt you afterwards.
Do not concern yourself, you will mature into it.
I assume no, as everybody desires change.
I hope that the romantic encounter went as you had desired.
I believe males prefer long hair, and most of my male companions prefer a brunette.
Okay, this is the biggest shock to a young man.
Only one man is worthy of the pleasure of taking your virginity, and that man is not your boyfriend.
Alternatively you could go to Las Vegas or Reno and win her a stuffed frog.
No, why? Did he break up with you?
You shoudl apologize for Valentine's Day and give her a bunch of sweet gifts like roses and cocoa.
Be honest with her, and move on.
Trust me you will find someone better.
Love isn't easy either.
You sound very popular with men!
They don't want to date their mother.
Personally, I think it is wrong to cheat on my spouse.
I need information on having good sex.
Have you explained to your partner that you like someone knew?
Do your best so you can enjoy the best.
Don't do anything because he wants you to, do it because you want to.
Unbelievably, it is all about the money.
The male is able to know, the female more than likely cant.
There are more productive questions to ask.
Men do not make plans to cheat on women.
I am unaware of anyone who does.
I recently met the most charming and sweet guy I've ever known.
Maybe she is attracted to us.
Have you ever met the man you speak to on the phone?
Explain exactly how you feel, don't hide anything.
That stereotypical saying is true, it does take two to tango.
Love knows no boundaries, we are all just people!
Finding this out the hard way is kind of sad.
Try your best, and if she cannot to appreciate it, it is her fault not yours!
Looking at it you will go limp or it will dry up, try it!
You may not be as adventurous.
There are men who like me, those who don't and those who are intimidated by me.
It didn't feel right.
I like men who are truthful.
Fifteen years old is young to be dating.
You should tell your best friend.
Do it clothed, while lying in bed or on a couch.
What can one do when it strongly feels destined to be?
Could you explain how I should kiss him?
Do not kiss each other if you think it will become more physical.
I hope you receive some better solutions.
Don't let it bother you.
After all we've been through, I don't feel I love my husband anymore.
She is well-liked by many boys.
Encourage the guests to dress in that era for the best experience.
I never seen her sleep, she is my girlfriend.
He is coming to meet you.
Last but not least, you need to spend money on her, do not be cheap.
Is she into that type of stuff?
I am bisexual and I would never do that, but if you feel that you have to go for it!
It is possible that it is just getting boring.
Which types of flirting do men prefer?
He is a Republican. Are you a Democrat?
So, ma'am, take your time.
The act of "swinging" is considered by many to be an unsavory practice.
You will only be able to be with him alone, otherwise.
Finally, why is it that women make better nurses than men?
I think I look like a fairy tale princess.
How do I begin a conversation with someone?
He is probably not a bot.
I can call you father!
It is hard to tell, except for maybe the bonding comment.
When you focus on yourself first, someone will come later.
Maybe at the end of the night.
I do not think Enzyte will increase the size of your manhood.
Then he must be able to trust you in getting married.
What does one do when the man you love cannot stop staring at another woman while you are with him?
I am on a fast, need-to-know basis.
You are her knight in shining armor, in a manner of speaking.
Friend, if it were my decision, he would disappear for doing something foolish.
His possession of a vehicle is a good sign, haha.
Then you caress her cheek and tell her that she's very attractive. Then you need to be close friends.
I perceive you as a challenge. And that is a good perception, if a woman desires a challenge.
You should not end your relationship with him for another man.
Then secure with bobby pins in a criss-cross pattern.
Last night, his parents revealed that they have given him permission to move out with me!
Do you know if the person is cheating and where?
I like technicolor because I feel that it shows the real me.
Go out with your friends and enjoy a girls' day!
You do not want to be mean, or have her misinterpret your feelings.
He can easily hold conversations with other females, he can joke with them, etc.
Get rid of the moron before he becomes dangerous to you!
Especially if the other man does not even notice you.
When you turn 18 years of age, then you may leave.
You only live once and sexually transmitted disease is not as serious as it once was.
In reality, money is not always the key issue.
You are not missing out on anything; I just got back in the game myself.
I suggest you talk to her about her preferences.
If a guy is someone you date on the rebound, tell them so and enjoy it.
Or you can figure it out the difficult way.
Do you believe that's anybody's problem with us as really what he or she is?
Try asking "do you want to go out" it works.
Look upset and make her aware that your life isn't going on without her.
I haven't been around either of ou guys to tell if there is a connection between the two of you.
Try walking around the neighborhood; You will not just loose weight, but you will also be more active.
I sit around and call all my friends when they are gone.
I always hear people say that they like Europeans more.
On top of that, my name is Bob.
In love, age really does not matter at all.
If that doesn't occur, you should tell him to retreat. If it does occur, you should not try to take him away. That is unhealthy.
Do not flirt with men who are in a relationship.
Do your best to deal with the situation.
I met a man that I enjoy being around, but I am still married. What shall I do about this situation?
How can you tolerate this man?
He wants her to disconnect with each other.
As soon as we get Bush's head on straight, we will get equal rights.
I feel lonely when my partner leaves.
Believe my, it is worth the wait.
Loving a person in spite of their faults.
And that just proves even more that I belong to him!
There are some strange people around, and the neighbor's child throws rocks at me.
Ask yourself whom you like better.
I like the way they always try to look their best, although I hate it when it is overdone.
Oh, and something more if he is helpful.
It can get better, if you let it.
If you are too shy to ask her out, eventually you will not like her anymore.
How do I tell her that I care about her?
I have dated a guy that was 10 years younger then me.
Do you think that he likes me?
We will have been married for five years this July.
I even enjoy talking with him.
No I am 23 years old, and I have returned.
I read Dr. Phil's book, 'Smart Love.'
Hello you are attractive. Do you own a Ferrari?
I do not know Blue or you, and I do not know what is in a person's heart.
I know that you can do it!
I think that she loves you very much, but she can not express her feelings in a good way.
Being too badly burned if the feelings are not mutual?
Angelina Jolie in a heartbeat!
Is it strange to ask in a coded manner?
In my opinion you should move out when you are eighteen before you go to college.
Be confident and do not try to use pick up lines.
I do not know if I should continue the relationship or not.
If you are a good person, it should not matter
why would i be able to not have legs like that??)
haha.. better believe it.. everybody here is distorts.. so becareful when you say that...
Ask him, I'd wagered he feels the same!
All folks play with young ladies, in the event that they don't, they are unusual.
Not each guy needs a indigent young lady.
But the Police will look upon you with shifty eyes.
Are you joking? Because your friend Kayla was just here asking the same of you.
I am kind, I am in need of female friends.
Let her go, she will return when he ends the relationship.
Perhaps that will be the reason you finally are relieved. (5 years?)
I would not lift the restraining order that you applied for.
Do not be discouraged by one person.
I like the sound it makes after it bends.
Better to play it safe on the first date than to rush things.
I am curious.
im liveing verification , what dont slaughter you will make you more grounded !
it happens constantly.
I simply believe that is clever.
the main individual that I kissed ,is my significant other now .
same ol tune, yet its actual he should be the ones that is forlorn fallin for a star
So what are you asking me?
I would love for you to perform fellatio on me.
That relationship may not last.
I am not strong.
She is not faithful to him.
You are always being observed.
Never did I think that he would simply ask me to have an affair with him.
You do not have to do it that way, if you do not want to.
Even have recurring dreams for months at a time.
I would then ask her for an opportunity to romance her again with dinner, flowers, dancing, etc.
Now, doing it is the last step for you.
"whooo hooo, lock the doors, baby!"
And, if you are a real woman, what a thing to say.
Yeah, you can kiss someone with braces even if you have braces yourself.
I've found mine, and we're engaged. Yay, me.
Why do men hurt women who love them?
When a man tells you to ask for assistance if you need it what is to be understood by this?
I do not understand what the complication is.
I do not allow him to come home.
I began noticing the acts he does including the acts he does not do.
I believe the majority of men prefer long, dark hair unless they like you already.
Why would you wamt him back?
For instance,  I will at least listen when my ex-wife says he is a really difficult person.
You should start dating when yiu are mature enough to get married.
Well, if he smiled he loved it, and you played STA?
Be assertive man, and go get her!
Or, on the other hand when she says, I adore you, you answer (or something like) I know.
Try not to wind up plainly another Victim of his!
no hun that man does not adore you, hes only being unreliable and a butthole
Try not to stress, pleasant folks do complete last, however they have pretty spouses, huge houses and truly quick autos!
What is the reason young men undermine young ladies and GET frantic when young ladies do it BACK?!!.
With friends like you, who needs enemies?
You could beat them, an if that does not work, take things away from them.
If they do not say they are preps, then that's why they are calling you a prep.
No worries, being single is much more fun.
At times people have to choose between their love and their best friend.
Be yourself, and enjoy life.
It will not work, and it hurts. It is always Mr or Mrs Perfect that are states away.
If you can make it work, there is no need to worry about size.
Cartoon gummi bears and Piranha have me nightmares. So did The Chipminks movie and Wild Boar.
Teach your family not to ask you that.
Ask your best friend a few questions.
I agree, but, get rid of the unintelligent people first.
You do not want to feel trapped if you have spent a lot of time with her.
I assume you mean " British"?
If he did truly love you, he would not harm you physically.
Change things around so that he will be interested.
I would not call her phone at all.
I want to be with this woman, but I also want to date around.
Add some details, and I will answer your question later.
If you are doing this just to have fun, then go ahead.
Do not do it; life is not that simple.
This guy told her he could not be seen with her.
Just tell him it is over.
There exist gentlemen who adore athletic females.
Have you ever thought that perhaps they are genuinely virgins?
If he is not partial to it, advance to the next male.
Every male I know gripes of similar issues.
Tell him you doubt his love for you.
He has never given up on me.
Right when you least expect it.
In addition, I try to get back at him everyday. Unfortunately, now he is really attracted to my best friend.
Make sure to listen and show her that you are listening.
I believe doing that would be a mistake for you.
Why does he refuse to take a chance at creating a relationship with me?
Girls of that age tend to be more unstable, given that they're younger, so they tend to play games due to their immaturity.
Does your love interest give you the love and attention you're looking for? Does he act oddly around you at times?
Look, I don't wish for our friendship to end so suddenly.
When I turn eighteen is when my parents will kick me out.
If that is something you would be comfortable with, then go ahead.
The one that makes you talk to the Lord; You know, like "Oh God yes!".
I think that you should when you find the right guy.
I do not know if I am cute, but if you say so.

My friend is interested in someone four years older, that's crazy; three years would be acceptable.
Why not have sex with as many people as you can while your still able?
I didn't mean a mix such as Canadian-American, I meant to refer to something such as Spanish-Russian, etc.

Do what is right for yourself and get a fresh start.
IF you are interested, what size do you wear?
Remember to have fun, be honest with each other, and only swing as a couple.  You are very lucky.

my companion kayla appears like shes playing with me, yet I dislike that!
I need to make the female unattractive.
Men of your stature are rare.
Not spending enough time with your offspring and significant other can be detrimental, especially when engaging in unethical behavior.
You are not incorrect, but are treading into trouble.
I wish you the best of luck, sincerely your friend lovelysaphirequeen@yahoo.com.
He wants to entertain you in a similar way that Levi entertains me.
No matter which decision you choose try to be kind when you make it.
You do not want to make her boyfriend jealous so that he becomes angry with you.
I am still interested regardless of the events that occurred.
Regardless of who the gentleman is; one must be true to themselves.
Sometimes being careless seems to be achieving one's goals and yet have much more work to do.
It depends on the age difference between the two parties.
It is best to make sure that both parties are in agreement.
She may be of need of assistance, so it is recommended to let her be.
I doubt you could ask a more difficult question to answer.
Last Valentine's Day, I purchased a soccer piggy bank filled with chocolate "Hugs and Kisses" for him.
If your parents do not mind, and you enjoy it, then forget everyone else's opinion.
So, I say forget about her.
So, I say do what you think is best, and do not even bother with protection.
Trust your intuition and be skeptical if something does not seem right with him.
He may be afraid that he cannot fulfill your desires.
More than half of married couples end in divorce.
Of all the options that's all I can recall.
Most people are not interested in dating an unattractive person.
Even though I am an ex model, good looking and in shape, it happens to me.
I need help dealing with my friend asking out my best friend.
She asked out someone else in December, after she broke up with me.
Let them know you are Christian and would like them to be as well.
David was my best friend whom I married.
He told me that I have beautiful eyes.
They resemble eyes looking at me.
Ask her when you can.
Before it is too late, I suggest dumping him.
Tell her the truth and if she thinks you are weird, then she is not a real friend.
You can do any position if you have an erection.
I met a really lovely girl last summer.
Did he help you while you were in school?
I am too wonderful to be cheated on.
I am not attracted to any of the young men at my school, so I am waiting for the right person to come along.
Try your best! Walk up to her, and ask her if she would like to go!
Be strong and firm, and give it time.
On the beach? No. On the couch? Maybe. I like the car and the floor because the former is private, and the latter has a signifcant amount of space.
Trust me, I am not flirting with you!
He will be a sort of companion.
I need something miraculous to occur.
My ex-partner liked my long hair especially during sexual intercourse.
You are welcome to contact me via e-mail if you need assistance.
It is obvious that you have feelings for her as a significant other or companion.
The answer is not having sex, however, if you are unable to control yourself then use protection such as condoms and birth control medication.
However, divorce does have the tendency to strike fear in some people, both men and women.
If your man does not tell you that you are beautiful then he could be self centered.
Spend lots of time with her.
They are unaware of what they have, they are being naive.
If you are serious, take one pill to achieve the best results.
If he is not then look for someone else
No, what I did, he still stood for and could not stop it.
That way it would be easier for me and my fellow women.
I offer you my sympathy. That is a difficult situation.
Couples should take turns doing things they each enjoy.
I am 17.  My question is: Is that legal.
Everyone reaches a point where they must examine their lives.
Being homosexual is morally wrong, as is overeating, smoking, cursing, littering, and polluting our world.
Some individuals aren't nice, no matter how well you treat them.
Do it for your wife.
Blonds tend to be fake and over the top, a brunette is a better choice.
Something boys like, like a sports item.
Hang out with him for a bit, and then ask him out.
Just because he doesn't have a camera doesn't mean a lot.
I have no objection to asking a man on a date.
In a humorous turn of events, I am getting married in February of 2010.
It is an achievement that you should be proud of. Live your life like a king.
Have you attempted to communicate your feelings to her about the matter?
You should take him for every penny that he's worth.
There is a possibility that your brother is content in the fact that her loves her very much.
I beg you!  I will stand by you forever!
It would depend on the girl I will be seeing at the time.
Please let me know if I can help you with anything.
Having diversity in your interests is a very healthy way to think.
I don't think I've ever heard it said that way.
All you have to worry about is you and your partner.
Guys get soft after a while, so sometimes they make mistakes.
If anyone cares, it might be less than eighteen.
The great thing is that I had my best friends around me.
It would be measured by how much compassion you have for her.
You can go to craigslist.com to meet a man.
If you have God in your life you are doing well.
It depends on how much you care for her.
Go to craigslist.com and search for women seeking men.
I have romantic feelings for my friend's ex-boyfriend.
I think you should kiss, take of his pants, and you know the rest.
The place you are in life matters.
Just ask her the same way I asked my boyfriend.
A nymphomaniac can only be a girl.
Some guys just want to have a girl who is younger.
Yes, believe me, you can do it with me.
I hope that this helps you more than it has helped me.
If this makes him distant, then you do not to be in a relationship.
Get out of the relationship now!
Ask if they want to be married by October 2006.
They are wrong, I don't know why they would say that.
You know you might have a great chance.
We used to hold a conversation all night but things have changed.
I believe it's not a good idea to date your best friend.
I understand what you are feeling.
Let's ask this question to him directly and wait for his response.
Why are you scared.
No, there are 10,000 more exactly like that one available also.
With that being said, you should move on with your life and try to enjoy it!
They say they do not mean it, but they are lying.
Vin Diesal and The Rock, but definitely not Arec Barrwin.
Don't worry so much about what people think.
Go wear it and do it.
Eighteen or older; anyone younger is still a child.
Would you fight for your love?
Find her brother, the 18-year old.
Don't just listen to your heart, use your mind too.
I was interrupted by my husband and you took off quickly. Maybe next time.
I am a Scorpio, I know.
His sister claims she only shows off to me.
Ok sweetheart, I had the same thing happen to me.
If he is overly threatened by this after only three weeks, run.
It keeps you interested and caring.
If there is a Build-A-Bear Workshop in your town, that always works.
His priorities are out of alignment.
Are you a girl and are you just curious?
Consider taking a trip to the doctor first, and ensure there is nothing truly wrong.
Walk up to him and say, "Hi."
It is all up to you.
His friends there will tease him about it.
I last seven or eight minutes before I am finished. Afterward, I need a sandwich and a beer.
You do not watch the series "Friends?"
Are you actually in love with her? Or are you experiencing infatuation, lust, or some other emotion?
I forgot to give the "courtesy tap."
He may ask you out. If he does not, then simply say you want to go out on Friday.
My friend, I should not start talking about that.
Very much, funny. Perhaps that is because my boyfriend is deployed overseas, and it has been a while.
Being with more than one person is alright if that is your preference. I think it is best to be with just one person.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Forget about who everyone thinks you should date.
By the say, good birthday, dear!
Masturbation is normal, don't let them tell you that it is not.
Young girls usually do not date guys their age.
Is it too early to know?
You can't force him to love you.
You don't want to forget your mother so you hang onto trinkets from her.
Afterwards you and your friends should go somewhere.
That could destroy her life and marriage.
Some men are nice, and some are too kind.
I suppose it is best that I did not.
Hello, my name is Mostafa and I am from Egypt. I am in search of a spouse.
It is if he says that he enjoys your company.
They look attractive each day just to do so.
More power to you for liking something that I do not. Enjoy it while it lasts.
You will know what you need to do if things don't go the way you want.
How would you feel if a 35-year-old man had sex with your 18-year-old daughter?
It is right under the head.
You, me and my dad all agree.
Do you really want to be second choice?
A male is reactive without concerning himself with details.
I went through a similar ordeal.
Another man has interest in her.
They will be found when least expected.
Determine if he has interest in you or not.
Yes, the breaking up and I was just kidding.
Half of my friends are male, and I consider them brothers.
Sit on him and move around.
If this eighteen year old man makes you happy, then enjoy it.
I have always followed my heart and now is it leading me to you. What do you think?
Think about it this way; if you were married, would you want your wife having intercourse with someone else?
If she is upset or worried that means that she cares. If she doesn't react then she doesn't care.
Ok here is more information that I have received.
If you show him that you are interested in him then he will feel more comfortable asking!
What do you think I should do?
It is easier, unless you're shy.
If I had more to lose, I would accept.
Ask your partner what they enjoy.
They're probably cheating or have no trust in you.
Just try to get lucky and wait for her to leave you?
I am looking for some sexually attractive lingerie for size XXL and upward.
I have attempted sexual relations with my wife, but have thus far failed.
Begin perceiving him the way you used to perceive him.
I received a satisfactory answer, charmer.
I do not perceive you as a timid person.
If you desire you may marry your first cousin.
You do not trust her much.
It shows you care for them.
Do all that you can to arouse him.
Is there someone that understands the situation that I am in, and could possibly help me seek answers?
He did it just to sleep with her.
Wear good clother, look presentable and be nice.
Do avatars have nice personalities?
Who ever I talk to he tells them to back off.
Let her know that you don't like it when she talks about her ex's.
You do have to choose.
In my opinion, Chris Brown is to light skinned and tall to be considered cute.
You already know the answer.
Do you really need a same sex marriage?
In my opinion, intercourse between two scorpio's is the best there is.
No tongue kissing on the first date.
He may not necessarily be cheating; he could just find you boring.
Some guys are really just for being friends with.
I would not worry too much about it.
You need to tell her parents or a teacher.
Do not give in because all he wants is sex.
I believe it may be possible.
I would say to not do that.
His company will look into it.
I am positive he likes me as well.
I think you understand what I am trying to say.
It takes a lot but I don't like how hard you're on yourself.
We have to lose them to get some peace and quite.
Think about how poor he was and that should help.
To begin with it sounds like he has the wrong idea.
Yes of course, because red is one of my favorite colors.
This isn't a friendly relationship, just showing compassion.
My advice is to leave if you're not happy, why are you still there?
It would help if you could meet an European lady.
Remove his pants while he watches sports on television, and orally pleasure him.
I'm not comfortable answering this question.
I suggest that you get to know each other first, and then see how the relationship unfurls.
I do not understand why you would want to have an affair with someone who ended a relationship with you.
I am a doctor, so trust when I say that you are a virgin until you have penetrative intercourse.
If you re frightened, inform her as you could pontentially be harmed.
Depends as to what you are implying by the term "arranged."
There are a few rather attractive African American gentlemen there.
Alas, this is what I believe you should do.
It is similar to breasts, and perhaps intercourse.
It sounds like any average crush.
One might say women do not know why they do it, they just do.
She will either answer or not. Because you know them and she thinks she is going to tell.
You can get his number and you call him.
You should wait untill you are married.
I agree with Rascal, you should get pictures.
I am Ashley's older sister. I am 14 years old.
You should leave your problems behind.
How much more experience would you like to get?
Don't settle. Find someone you love.
Is there a reason you are not supposed to like him?
I do not believe you are a lesbian.
Do not worry Sweetie, it will not last.
Go on being happy with your life.
Do whatever you want, just do no get into trouble.
What can I do to better my chances of winning her back?
I am not going to sneak about as if we are doing something wrong.
She is your past, let it go man, I hate it when my friend Phil says that.
The guy does not even know how to use it, but, the lady does!
I did, sort of, after my first try.
She had to mentally mature at a young age.
Where are you from? I am from Washington D.C.
Getting along with your life is a lie.
Wait until one comes to you.
I like him, he likes me and is really cute, but his sister hates me!
Adultery is a serious crime.
Come on, it is you first cousin, think of your future children.
You will not waste anymore time on self doubt.
A lover is easier to find than a genuine friend.
Find a partner that was nerdy.
He is handsome and a talented singer.
To some girls, pulling out the make-up bag may be funny.
Well, unless you turn into a nun, you will get married.
Me and women both are concerned about their performance.
Their opinions are irrelevant to me.
If the woman you are interested in is in a relationship, you need to pursue someone else.
I try my best to be strong, but when it comes to that I am weak.
I do not care what age you are, or if you are having sex.
She does not like potatoes.
Most girls like guys who are slightly bad.
Nothing too big or serious, it is only the first date, you have time!
You are thirteen, you would wait until you hit puberty first.
You just need to coax it.
I have been cheated on and it was a horrible experience, nothing but a nightmare!
If he is handsome, yes.
He is afraid to pursue them.
He doesn't consume alcohol.
It sounds like she needs to let go.
Thank you for you opinions, but I was joking.
I hope you find what you need!
If you are honest and can trust each other, there is no reason to be jealous.
If he likes to watch television
How should I win his affections again?
Talk to his friends.
Why don't you just start over fresh and forget about the past?
The two of you would be very unhappy.  In the end, you would wind up cheating and would hate each other.
Do you have a romantic interest on the Internet?
Do not settle for someone who cheats or is a jerk.  You deserve better!
I have really great friends who are girls, and we can just be friends.
Yes, I have some friends who are female.
Yes, in that circumstance it will not hurt much when you are married and you will be experienced, which men find attractive.
You should converse with me, Saleem_nawaz, and we will speak briefly.
I know that I have told that to many men; however, I was sincere.
If you love and trust her, overlook this.
Why are you involved with a married woman at all?
It is not a question, of course the answer is Eminem!
I find this very amusing, you must really appreciate this lady. I am laughing in amazement!
Even women will appreciate a little challenge.
Take as much time as necessary to please a lady.
Waiting and socializing until something presents itself as entertainment.
First, draw her a hot bath. After that, undress her, gently lift her, and place her into the water.
My wife is aware of the fact that I have many female friends, and she trusts me regardless.
In the long run, a good man will respect you for it.
Place it gently as it arrives.
She will love you just as she did in the beginning.
We don't understand.
If you don't then it is your issue.
Mail it, or give it to a friend.
It is possible, but it could be someone who is 97 and aging.
She was not nice, and didn't treat him well.
You are not attracted to women.
It may hamper the relationship if you intervene.
Why is he staring at you?
They do not state that in the beginning.
Why do I attract males that are below my standard?
If you do not experience attraction towards women.
Do not be arbitrary with either of them because it could damage the relationship.
Ask why he is staring at you.
And, of course, they do not tell them that directly.
Why is it that I attract only impoverished men with many children and concealed weapons?
Provide them with all the information you have and to be careful.
Is there a difference whether the male were older or younger than the female?
Most people are unsure about what they did.
It surprises me that anyone thinks differently.
He is not serious with you, he is only playing games.
Do you still want to spend time with her?
I did ate around a bit, but I thought I had nothing to fear.
You should just accept the gift and be happy with it.
She is behaving like the average woman.
I manipulated him, it may have been wrong but it worked for me.
The police will get involved.
They are usually fake.
No he still doesn't care for you.
I can handle both at once.
If she left you then she is a loser, and does not love you anymore. I would get over it and move on.
Many people would say that they are not really happy.
Try to connect with this person, but if you cannot then do not even try to go there.
Yes, you should do the things that make you happy, be with the people who make you happy, and not worry about what people thought.
Forget her. Find someone who actually appreciates you.
Well when you think about it, gay men have sex with other men.
Although I do not think it is.
Whites are usually 5-6 inches, Hispanics are 7-8 inches, and Blacks are 7-9inches.
Break up with him. She can do better.
If that is what you're asking, then you are not going insane.
It's possible that the type of girl you're looking for doesn't go to your school.
I tend to prefer brunettes, but I am not opposed to blondes.
She has plans to lay down and relax on a bed of very green grass.
Of course, right now. I don't know if he is interested in me, but I am certainly interested in him.
By the way... My girlfriend is not bisexual or she has not tried it, but finds it also is a turn on.
If so, then I would say so.
Just ask him or do not if you never want to know.
He is just trying to protect his girlfriend.
When I look at a girl, of course at first we see how she looks.
Invite him to your next wedding.
I understand, I know you are having a hard time.
Not all men are bad.
I had already had four boyfriends by the time I was thirteen.
The wedding is in April. The colors are lavender and white, with fresh cut flowers in huge vases on the head table.
Don't try to be someone you are not.
That is, if you both want to.
Youmhave to be in love first if the sexual part will be any good.
If she does not like potatoes, just finish yours and she can eat what she wants to eat.
The two if you have different opinions about buying shoes, but that does not mean she will stop buying them.
I feel that some men have low cognitive function.
Madam, may I suggest that firstly you see which one takes a liking to you.
I'm Kyla. Nice to meet you.
Happy Wedding Day. If you haven't already, I suggest that you get a karaoke machine.
How do you think she will react if you irritate or bore her?
I would enjoy being asked out by a girl.
You need to make yourself the priority if he is being unfaithful.
Infatuation is fleeting, but true love is not.
We are more like acquaintances and can go months without intimacy.
One caveat is that there are attractive 33 year old men as well.
It is not as complicated as a man asking a woman on a date.
After he placed the ring on my finger, he no longer had any interest in me.
Not at age 13. It is eighteen years old for both men and women in the United States.
It sounds like nothing at all is wrong with you.
If you use them as examples they will realize how unfair and childish they are being.
As you know, I spend time on the computer which keeps me from getting anything done.
It is my opinion that you should not drop out.
Experience has taught me this.
It is a great way to spend time with others.
A church function is the best way to spend your time.
I don't think they are close friends.
They may have mized feelins and don't know how to love you.
Buff means that they have a strong appearance.
It isn't good or bad, it is an opinion.
Don't go back even if they say they've changed.
I would break up with him!
If the right guy really is out there, when is he going to get here?
Say hello and be nice!
They have been dating for about two months.
I thought they were just kidding around, no man has a problem of that magnitude.
Try always to grasp what his point of view is, and never try to attack his ego.
Your points may not be well taken, if he continues to ignore all outside views, other then is own.
I resent the fact that two cute girls are fawning, over a male that doesn't know they are around.
Making lots of money, is a way for a lot males with self-esteem issues to compensate for their self-esteem problems.
It is of no concern to others whether or not she has feelings for the gentleman.
You may not believe so, but you do harbor strong feelings for the gentleman.
With the lack of love people would procreate such as those of the canine species without any emotions.
Spend more quality time with him by talking and flirting.
In the end it does not really matter.
She said that he liked me.
Meet up with him and be honest when you tell him why.
When you see that man be yourself and do what your heart says at that time.
I first met baby's father when he was a picture perfect man.
I am not a huge loving person, but I do know what love is about.
I'm told he just doesn't go with me.
Next time I'll find someone better.
He still makes me nervous.
The child subject makes sex harder.
He doesn't give you gifts for your birthday, or holidays?
Should one sleep with his brother or his best friend?
One seems to be much older than the other participants.
Allow your friend to be happy by giving her the opportunity of being with him.
What is your name, and also, why does she have to be of a different race?
I thought I was in love.
Firstly, it has to do with your age.
Ask him to stop staring at you.
A child should not have to grow up listening to arguing and violence.
In my experience, it rarely lasts.
You have to be careful with that.
If your sister told you to holdon, then come back, she is not here.
Only if you like alot of sex.
But there are some guys who cover it up by marrying women.
Now that I answered it I am not so bored anymore...Hey, thank you.
I am having a Napoleon Dynamite moment..You could do as Pedro does and make her a cake?
You can subtly drop hints and maybe he will ask you out on a date.
A person who is shy may look at you because they are afraid to make a move.
He is always saying sweet things to me and about me to others.
Feelings, including love, come and go.
I honestly think that some people are undecided when it comes to who or what they want.
Let him know how you feel and he may just ask you out on a date.
He compliments me all the time.
If it's not true love it will end.
Honestly they are not sure about what they want.
Has anyone ever informed you that you have difficulty succeeding in social matters?
I suggest that you cease eating them.
I have been involved in a similar circumstance to this before, and what I found most effective was kindness.
Ask him directly and do not hesitate.
What is it that I am not doing, or should not be doing?
As a matter of first importance is she the one for u, at that point u shouldn't stress over being embarrased.
No one ought to be anybodys punching sack it is quite recently off-base.
I have heard that brunette is recently Latin for blonde wanna be :-p
obviously it's conceivable have a fabulous time
They generally need the awful young men.
Anyone why says 'hi' is a girl, and a woman says 'hello.' Just observe.
June 2006? It sounds like he needs to graduate from somewhere.
She was not the one. Why?
I have 3 different friends, buy they do not know eachother.
If you are only interested in sex, then do not marry anyone.
If you ask her to go on a date she will go with you.
Give them time to understand.
There is good and bad in everything, being married for example.
To many guys ask me out, I don't need to ask them.
He wants to be with you so he hasn't told her yet.
Raising your children in that kind of situation will influence their future decisions.
I am 19 and still searching for a real man.
You only live once so live it well.
Your children will be raised believing it is okay, when it really is not.
I weighed 98lbs when we got married and now I weigh 140lbs.
I really miss it, can you tell?
I do not see what is wrong with you looking at another woman and saying "she looks nice".
That depends on what type of guy he is. but both I guess.
I really like the girl, so I want it to be nice.
Your actions will keep you out of trouble and on the right path.
Remember, you are a helper; Give him love and encouragement.
What is wrong with you, of course men want that.
I am very sorry to say, but I believe he likes her.
Have you ever done anything to her that would cause her to not like you?
I am going to wait until after I am married.
Take the time to look inward, then, go and get him.
It was strange. I was suprised that people actually enjoy that.
If you tell her and she is normal herself, she is sure to break up with you.
You can flirt with him sometimes when you are together, but do not go overboard.
There is nothing wrong with that you are doing, just be honest with him.
It is so wrong for me to date a guy !
In the meantime, get friendly with some ladies five to ten years older than you.
In my opinion a great many people confuse lust with true love.
Of course, if the individual is mean, or intoxicated.
If as a couple you began with nothing, a prenuptial agreement would be an insult.
Show him that you support him, and gradually give him your love.
Of course I don't know everything regarding my wife's past.
My situation is better than having four husbands!
They act that way because they find you attractive and want to have a relationship with you.
I don't mind staring at men.
Discuss the positive and negatives.
I wonder how many people would want to answer this question.
Yes, it shows you have good taste!
The number of questions is overwhelming.
The odd thing is that they married each other.
It's not that they aren't knowledgeable - they are just very confused at the moment.
It is never acceptabil to victimize and prey on young girls.
It would be better for you to extricate yourself from the relationship.
It is difficult to find respectful men today, and that is exactly what you need!
To find time to spend with you.
Your abrupt defensiveness informs me that you are too young for me.
Take his hand, and ask him on a date!
Lust at first sight, yes.
He would have to pay alimony for the rest of her life or until she gets remarried.
I feel like I can do better on my own.
Sometimes he has intercourse in bathrooms and other seedy places and she never knows.
That means that if one spouse is caught cheating, the other gets everything and he gets nothing.
Would you like to have a cup of coffee together sometime?
I think that it should be for marriage only.
When it comes to blue, there are not many blue flowers.
This guy also sounds like it.
Girls like men who have skills such as being a handyman with a personality and bowstaff.
As long as one must think about sexual relations, does he like it?
I love my boyfriend greatly.
I hope this elucidates the subject better.
If you broke up with her, then I doubt she will want to get back in a relationship with you.
Now, I understand why it is best to wait.
This is not a difficult problem and I think most of you are mistaken.
The age of 18 is challenging for many.
The solution is some lubrication, such as KY Jelly, and a lot of foreplay.
You should just wait for the right single guy.
In addition, should she say no, ask her to explain why.
You should be just as good a person on the outside as you are on the inside.
I think you should tell the police.
If at all possible, the woman should separate herself for a time.
That is a great question, however the answer is "not as many as I do".
Typically, guys are not very good at getting subtle hints.
Just the thought makes me uncomfortable.
Jealousy can escalate to abuse quick, please be careful.
She would mention it to you.
My boyfriend is like that, it is overbearing.
He likes you if he teases you.
I plan on remaining with this man for the foreseeable future.
He was not receptive of my advances.
Would you want to do first:  exchange photos or telephone numbers?

I am asking this question to find out how many girls actually fake it and why.

Perhaps you just do not feel ready yet.
Nathan (nā'thən) in the Bible.
The most appropriate manner in which to inform a lady you no longer wish to be her paramour is to be honest.
Keep us informed as to what occurred.
But, the saying is, "If you love something, let it go. If it comes by, then it is real."
But, five months is of no importance.
If you do not adore her any longer, inform her and do not harm her.
It is right next to the vein on the underside of the phallus.
I would like to know what to do.
I am content with what makes me happy.
I feel that women sometimes find another man to get back at their ex.
He is sixteen and cute.
Depend on your mother and father for your livelihood.
It is because the male originated first and the woman second, so males had sexual desire first.

I sure hope that there are no children involved!

My former paramour was unfaithful which lead to our falling out currently.
Unbelievable, dear lady, you are thirty-three years of age, yet you appear to be more similar to my own age?
i didn't intend to go out with him.
Also, gracious my God, why might you remain with some wedded washout at any rate.
Rather than hanging out with them, now you hang out with your uncommon somebody, yes?
Young ladies don't normally get frantic, they get even.
So be it...she needs another closet?
She is constantly with you to ensure you are not doing anything she disapproves of.
Do you think that you got it from him?
You know it is special if she cares for your family and friends.
Whenever I sense her getting more serious, I get nervous and fail to reciprocate.
I am sexy, you should get to know me!
Just speak with her and treat her like anyone else.
It depends on what you're purchasing, likely.
We used to do those things, why have we stopped?
I'm an attractive man, will that work for you?

You are going to have very hard times.
Soon if you would like, but late if you are not interested.
If you are a man it is different.
What did you do to lose her?

Time and experience are among them.
When your desires are not fulfilled then that hurts.
If she could do what your mom can do for you.

You may end up losing your relationship if you sell yourself short.
This is a dumb question, but I thought I would be able to get opinions from some people. Thank you.

As a 13 year-old, I feel confident in what I am doing.
If you are friendly, you will have a lot of friends.
Should I give it a chance?
You do not have to worry, I am not gay.
It will make you more likable and gain friends.
Do not extend a relationship by making him think you love him.
He will give you one.

I would tell him face to face.
Thirteen is too early to start dating.
Maybe the guy that is mean to you likes you!

The deception alone is wrong.
If all he is doing is staring, that's not considered stalking.
Why would you want a friend that you don't know?

If another man is interested in her, leave her alone.
The question is, who doesn't like him?
The fact is, I don't like him.

Well, you are correct in that regard. Try using the other hand instead.
Some of my closest friends are men.
Is that your true desire?
If they want it again then they are likely to call sooner rather than later.
