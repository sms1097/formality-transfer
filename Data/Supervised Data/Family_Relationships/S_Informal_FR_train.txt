Sure, it's ok, but I always have let the guy ask me.
Hmmm, I'm a guy suffering from verbal abuse from my wife.
You will have more friends that you want... ;)
It's nice, you get to see pictures of who you are talking to!
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT 2 DO
LOVE ME LOVE ME OH DEAR GOD LOVE ME!
it wouldnt be a word, it would be me singing operah.
I like my life with the exception of her yelling and cussing.
I know how that is .
does he have a fave sports team?
no why he will just do it over and over some more while you are gone.
well the best way is to say look this isnt working out im not into this anymore.
no sista, i don tink so.
Then kiss her;) works every time bro!!!!
Women mature way faster than men and some men never mature.
and ever since then i never bought her another gift.
and if you really want you can attend her classes with her.
you wont until you pick to be wealthy and powerful.
dont beg for love dont beg for money and dont beg for respect.
But you will DEFINALTELY know when you are in love!
JUST DON'T BASE YOUR RELATIONSHIP ON MONEY OR MATERIAL THINGS.
If someone asked this:How can I get my boyfriend to notice me?
i can't sign in at the chatroom
you just live with a friend,and i call that friend with rights.
that trying to change yourself...unless you're really screwed up...but the question doesn't really give us much to go on
i cant read his mind but sometime we just like to watch.
go to france and hear for yourself.
She knew my ex was married.
Don't care about what people say.
well good luck whatever you do.
As long as your not my wife ... it's fine with me ...lol ...
because you are still in middle school i do not suggest dating someone in high school.
If that doesn't work try someone else.
tell him you are getting fired if he calls one more time
then a guy got involoved and changed everything!
There's just one of me, but I'm willing if the 4 of you are!
First, they are not BORN that way, no matter what anyone tries to say.
try a different kind of girl.
this girl and i cross a few lines here and there.
If you really love him then yes.
dump him as soon as possible its the only thing you  can do dont be stupid and keep him
i learned to love myself something i had never done before.
i go to an all guys school and i have been having trouble meeting girls.
3_again don't rush and use words...talk...
you should be playing with dolls
Well... Do you talk to that someone much?
is that considered double dating?even though no level of commitment with the platonic girl fried
its not the size of the boob but rather how well one can carry her boobs thats attractive.
all you got to do is ring her bell !!!
yes, well i guess it depends on the vows.
maybe you `should be asking where are the stds in Ks.
meaning that you do not need to make her as your enemy any more.
then ask her to the next school dance or maybe to see a movie?
Something going on with your friend or hers?
But, dont get me wrong dont be a doormat and take the submisive route either...find some middle ground!
Might not work too well if you're a real wuss though and end up more scared than she is.
I guess that depends on if her and her husband are swingers...
she wants fun thats y she has affair with u.  dont get serious with her.
just say that you just want to be friends for now.
Because they're just doing their job!
get out now while you can
yes if they are sexually addicted to it, but then i would say go to a sex coucenlor.
personally, i think young guys (over 25) are hot!
because boys are not mature enough to know what they want are know what they have.
5' 135 lbs sounds about perfect to me.
Oh, Honey, please see a counselor!
If so, I wouldn't be surprised if he cheats again.
if went with her abviously he didnt care, its not all her fault.
If she hasen't bought it up there is no need to talk about it...
You could try to check there 1st.
If you want one for you maybe you should try Yahoo Personals, shouldn't you?
First off you gotta be nice to them and just wait on them.
don't hide anything frm him.go ahead and talk to him.
The same things that you look for in a guy...
Girls who ask guys out are ten times more successful than girls who don't.
so simpleman fell in love 1 time with his wife and thats real love what he said
Don't retaliate - you shouldn't drop to her level.
cafes/coffee houses; the mall (last resort) i guess it depends on what kind of girl you're looking for.
He will like anything u give him, if he really loves u !!
I'm a prude, so I'm going to say marriage.
I, for one, am not like that.
JUST LOVE THEM THE WAY THEY ARE.
i married too many times for love..depends on how much money  we are talking.lol
mad props to you dude.. very nicely done.. she'll definitely love it.
His dad, meanwhile, is obsessing over this girl.
fisrt off, that is not a friend.
Hope You can answer me !
my other friends agree with me as well.
But I say love whoever you love and don't even make race a factor.
Please don't go any further with this guy.
Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'.
any ideas where i could go to meet them?
If you really like her go with the group.
Nine Inch Nails---Closer  the sexiest song on the entire planet
whatever they accuse you of they are doing it.
Other than that, just be yourself!
Do be funny and a little cocky.
Simply tell him  Hey I don't like you like that, just let go.
Just see it like that then forget about him or her.
WOMEN WANT A MAN WHO WILL NEVER CHEAT ON THEM .
something to look at or play with
My Dress was long with a 15 foot train!
All you have to do is comunicate and be yourself and you will be happy
When you started to think that right..........that time it self you...ur self got the answer which is wroung.
i got hurt pretty bad last time so it is just me.
call him & talk to him about it.
u'll almost never find a guy that likes you for you and not because you like him.
just tell them you love them very much
It would have to be someone that I know.
she dont feel the same bout you...let it go....do you even know?...talk to her
Now don't let the other person read it.
2. make sure the bestfriend wouldn't have a problem with it(obviously).
i heard that it doesn't really matters what matters is if you nkow how to use it
GO FOR A GUY THAT U THINK IS HOT, BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER!
It's not as bad as everyone makes it sound.
sleep with em, you will like each other better
and you prolly shouldnt have a GF
yes and no, it matters because of comfortabilty and maybe psychological reasons for men, just guessing there.
Maybe you can relive that, then kick it up a notch.
Being in love doesn't hurt at all, losing love does though.
my bbf had many reasons why she didn't like my b/f.
if i were in your shoes i would buy him something he likes.sweatshirt or something like this.
Get together with your friends and have fun!!!!!
yes , b/c there is a reason why you proposed, so she should be worth the re think.
and if you need help ask him for i think he'd rather help than get yelled at and stuff.
THE BEST WAY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TO JUST SAY IT.
someone who can take care of us in the long run men are big babies
compliment her boobs, girls love that!!!!!!!!!!!
There for you guys just don't notice that we poop!
Very untraditional, I don't like the thought... but ofcourse it's okay.
I ONLY CAN SPEAK FOR MY SELF,I'M A FUN-LOVING GUY.
think about what you want from a wife
So maybe you should try it.
you can find ppl online, or where you live.
Get it out in the open baby!!
try craigslist.com they have tons of chat rooms for Seattle
That is nonthreatining and she maybe shier that you know!
no, because he is going out with Katie Cassidy  I LOVE JESSE TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no , maybe you can buy a nice warm blanket, to keep you warm.
- good listener  - a good friend won't hurt your feelings.
if he's a good guy, who cares about his color?
alternatively, you could just find a new best friend - there are plenty out there.
I dont konw if it is possible.
no different between ages if the mind is near to eachother
Gimme a hand here girls; plz.
Hope you like my ideas !
SMS If you still can't contact, 5.
if u like him ask him out and spend more time with him
But trust your inner voice and do what you feel you have to!
Show up on her doorstep and be like Listen here bitch!
husbands JUST CAN get it UP AS FAST AS A YOUNG GOOD LOOKING TEEN> THATS WHY
You give me power, you give me reason So will you love me?
plus its not only the age thing hes white and im blk.
there's more to love than saying i love you.
that is just my gut feeling.
You give me power, you give me reason So will you love me?
plus its not only the age thing hes white and im blk.
there's more to love than saying i love you.
What do YOU do if *I* love a girl on the internet?
that is just my gut feeling.
If she is happy than don't allow jealousy to rear it's ugly little head.
No, I always end up with lumberjack!
its becuase they love each other.
Maybe if you knew how he broke up with his daughters mother.
Then you go and find another girl, what the heck, there are thousands!!!!
should i trust this jerk or leave him?
WHY BUY THE COW IF THE MILK IS FREE!!!
if the pipe game is serious hell yeah but just don't get pregnet!!!!
no, your are no a nice person to be with....
So it be first time or the 100 time use protection!
As I said before, finding that special person just happens, you can't plan it!
If there is one thing girls like, it is a man who spells nice.
Ps- Look at my question, I posted I need help, too.
Mature men could care less if their girlfriends are virgins or not.
WELL IT COULD BE A TRUST THING MY MOTHER IS LIKE THAT WEN MY STEP DAD GOES AWAY.
He has a baby.. let him work things out with his woman.
its ok your just waiting for the right person or u dont trust people that well
im kinda stuck in the middle!
Because a guy will lie, cheat and steal to get you in bed....thats why
He has a baby.. let him work things out with his woman.
its ok your just waiting for the right person or u dont trust people that well
first off... how is it that he didnt have a choice??
im kinda stuck in the middle!
Because a guy will lie, cheat and steal to get you in bed....thats why
that's if you still care !
To me Love is Gotham City
my question is that , I am just cutting the girls away from me.
YOU AINT INLOVE YOU JUST NEEDED A FRIEND
if she says u know i do then forget it
he was an extrovert and i the introvert.
you have nothing to loose anyway since by planning this your already going to hell.
but there is always the right person for you out there
u r   in the right place right now.
I'm a butt man myself, so shake it like a polaroid picture!
he was an extrovert and i the introvert.
you have nothing to loose anyway since by planning this your already going to hell.
but there is always the right person for you out there
u r   in the right place right now.
im crazy but ive gotta leave u
and im assuming that you mean Amarican.
I could be that she/he just want to have something, some fun or...
(a tear came out of his eye when he said that.)
i think that men a more creative and i guess women too.
Ask him and see what he says.
Ask him if he likes you plain out.
she dont like nice usual guys and we cant lock her up in the house
OH NO, No No it will NOT hurt you in that time.
Keep your eyes open, but love him anyway.
A heady cocktail that girls find irresistible !
(i love your questions btw, give me more to answer, lol)
does she feel the same way??
thats when your underwear gets sucked up by your crack
yeah, they can say it back, but those are only words.
I dont want to date anyone else...Should I just be patient?
ask him....thats the best way but is there signs?
I honestly don't believe in chat-up lines - just be yourself.
listen to the XXX soundtrack #10
Why can't he just sit and hear me out.
If you fail, then ask her again and again and again.
he has to love it and want it to be worked on.
Are you looking for bad girls or a nice girls?
Because the destiny of the human been is to ask until death !
and it might not be a bad idea to get some counselling.
he would really like it if you kissed him on his .....
Because you don't look that good.
Dump her ,she is probly useing U
you will make someone happy - for a whole day.
You would not like it one bit and probably blow a gasket over it.
If you find something 'nice' or 'pretty' or something upsets you - tell her.
do u hesitate to talk to them?
You always want what you can't have.
But I'm still in love with him.
Loosen her up and then see what happens.
i looked at girls that i liked funny just to throw them off.
also balance, what is also sexy getting the rent payed.
It goes back to caveman days.
why in the world would jesse want to date you,that is a stupid question
Will a wink and some flirting help?
cut off ties 100% and out of sight, out of mind.
I met my husband online and he isn't a serial killer, at least not that I know of :)
Hangout with the girl for awhile...
I'm telling you--they are out there!
TO CHERISH THEM AND LOVE THEM FOREVER.
honey let me tell you what i know i met my boy friend ted carter and be happy
sorry, but i don't think she'll be faithful
First of all why was the house a mess anyway?
If she's not, she won't even think about getting a goodbye kiss.
Few weeks like about 3 or 4 but sometims it takes u MONTHS
and they start screaming that all you do is harp about money, you've got a problem.
Yes, well it took me sometime but I got over it once I went to the strip club.
Definitely - we just don't make as big of a deal about it as guys.
a marriage proposal or  a ring
Good Luck  hope things work out for you
curious as to the type of guy turns a woman on.
Just give ol' Mom a break and let her have her fun.
And he cant just pick the women he wants to be with like the large membered men.
maybe she is not ready for something as big as marriage.
Stay with girls your own age.
then ask her how her day is going.
just keep looking, it will happen.
I dont see what the big deal is.
and dun have money...you will feel good wit ur self.love dun cost a thing
You don't know what a full figure woman is?
Maybe the sex just sucks, go look one up and ask them.
sounds like domestic violence to me.
I myself am not gay, i was just wondering what your imput is.
(I dont want to hurt their feelings) thanks
a card that says Merry Christmas P.S.
he needs to earn ur trust and respect.
my last choice would be something like full length, thick, long pajamas.
People become mature at different ages, and some never do.
dont just get a easyer chick ;)
No problem if he likes you too!
Call her later that day and THEN kiss her.
get the message dont call again!
Who's going to arrest ya for asking a dude out?
Don't talk about work or boring stuff.
U GET DEPRESSED AT SOME TIMES U FEEL LIKE U CANT DO NOTHING JUST LET IT GO PAST.
take her out to dinner or something
You know the things I mean -observe & learn & apply .
But when the getting isn't getting good anymore is it goodbye?
Or are you looking for someone else to make it that way for you.
i don't know, but to me you sound like a desprate LOSER that is in need for some sex!!!!
and i wasnt sure if i was.
yes there is but  you have to go through a couple bad ones first
YOU NEVER HAPPEN TO LISTEN TO THEM AT ALL!
AFTER WHICH NOTHING WILL BE MATTER.SO, IT'S BETTER TO ENJOY IT.AFTER ALL U GOT A LIFE TIME CHANCE.
Good luck With Finding Love if you haven't already!!!!
hang out with girls more often or make some girlfriends.
but if things can't work then come to a understanding of what u want to do.
no this should not worrie you his sister is going just relax.have a good time with out him.
Pls don't make it a cage.
Sort of like a guy if he were walking a toy poodle vs a huge dog.
if he is really trying to find one - no.
Keep looking, the right one isn't gonna dump 'ya!
dont make her feel guilty over her answer either.
and start talking to her and be ginuinly (can't spell) interested in her.
Getting mad won't solve a thing.
its like rusian ruelette in the end you always lose!
if so don't damn her for the same thing you would do.
What is he angry so about?
Do priests also fuck their altarboys?
so, dont get too much that spoil ur life
if he doesnt feel the same way about u he wont ignore u. it won ruin the friendship.
Hang out with friends eevry chance you get.
physical disabilities (like someone who uses a wheelchair)
like wat is the rule towards that?
you first have to read my other questions and then youll know how to answer this ok...
did he get a girl in time??
No, People make mistakes no matter if they are in love or not.
(and then cleaning the house too!)
if you love children, and you love him... its perfectly fine.
or maybe he's just not ready to say he loves you back.
So what if he freaks out...if he does that is.
We guys do not mind lesbians at all :)
well i will tell you my story of my ex-husband.
If hes is not smiling already just by looking at you !!
1- wear short outfits only to him.
perfectly allright many girls hav asked me out
if you cant spend time with her and communicate theres no reason to pursue
most of the time it do's not mean anything.
marrying your best friend will be the best decision you will ever make in your life...
if you are then you like both men and wommen
Woman pretty much lose their minds...so sorry fellas but that's just the way it is...
you seem like your pushing the issue to much
I don't have a problem with it.
if you don't try you will always wonder what if good luck
have u ever had sex in the car???
i'm all for anyone being able to get married.
(No, I don't mean dropping hints).
And older men just totally rock.
Also started to smoke witch I hate....Thats NOT the sweet, loving guy I met years ago.
just make sure he uses a condom.
Block all the porno sites so he cant look at it again.
I BET YOUR NOT THE ONLY ONE THERE WHO USES LIGHT AND A PHONE ECT.
LOL YOU ARE A FUNNY GIRL
i will marry for love  but if both things come i'll gladly take it
no ways men grave for sex women just loves it
(and not only car doors, but every door, everywhere we go!)
I've seen this in a movie.
every 1 fights...but u dont wanna waste ur life on 1 gurl if u dont love her
No excuse not to have a job man.
who would want someone who treats you like shit.
because some want to get pregnant, some don't
BUT LOVE ITSELF IS FEELING IT AND KNOWING YOU LOVE SOMEBODY
try this search engine it might help
My wife has big boobs too!
hello i am from iran i want to married with a man  a good man that love me
And of course, dont flirt, dont talk and dont dance with that person.
If she won't listen, then let her be.
So far it has worked out really well :)
cause woman give alot of explaination for everything and repeat 10000.. times
This is just way over the hill!
Those kind of people are such a pain in the ass!
AM I GONNA LET ONE NIGHT OF SEX RUIN WHAT I HAVE AT HOME.
Mention a thing you like and see if you get a (belated) X-mas gift
Your hubby gave you a ring.
Just go straight to the matter and ask her to be your girlfriend.
only if you want to, but then deep in your mind you can't forget about.
im sure if your mom found out she would be pretty pissed.
(there are lots of creepy stalker types out there.)
actualy you can look her up in the house its your right as a parent.
ethan hawke:)) beauty is not his best quality...but he sure has that sex-appeal:)))
most likely you best friend will be happy to help you
amarica being so generaly fat in all.
Congrats for trying and don't give up.
that could turn ugly if things go south.
dude if ya gotta ask then she probably don't or your too insecure
Because when they say something dirty, it sounds so naughty!
if devil then mabey an angel isnt for you.
But don't listen to the young one!
Also what do guys like during sex?
it depends on what you like.
love isn't a thing 2 b ashamed of.
ok so I really like this guy at school alot..and I have for about 3 years now.
But don't give her or her family any reasons not to like you.
Rouse Christina .. don't know what I mean?
the forehead, down to my cheeks, then the lips.
Don't use any pick up lines just talk to them.
I wanted to do something like this too!
Did u masturbate in front one other?
Give him one more chance to change (if U r really in Love with him)
i dont even remember how our friendship started.
no because that is the begining to what will come.
I AM A LIBERIAN 20 YEARS OLD HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE
It's only because you know he's having fun and you're not.
Or, they are just plain stupid!
i would suggest you take it easy if you think she or he still love you.
Probably with his family its okay.
but like I said before if you trust him I wouldn't worry.
If they don't even bother to talk to you...
xbox 360...i'll love you forever (or he'll love u 4eva)
THEY FEEL SOMETHING,,,that they want to have that kind of things.
Yes romance is great...candles, rose petals, etc.
WHY NOT WATCH THE COMMET TO DO THAT WONDERFUL THING.
But she is not happy, coz I work too hard.
Think of her favorite thing, place, person, etc.
Dumb lil love cards on sticky notes.
my daughter is 10 and still says its gross so she doesnt like the idea at all.
by usher     wine by r kelly and thing that is soft r&b that has a good beat
Love, because with love there will come romance!
whack it before u get down to bizness
C'mon, dude,the worst thing that could happen is being rejected!
Like a CD from a band he likes.
They haven't yet figured out that girls are people, not toys.
He says he *has* to cheat?
she prolly thinks ur weak now.
We are pretty good friends and I don't want to ruin it But I really really like him.
and listen to see what she says .
there is no dabate for me love all the way....
Tell her all the things you love about her and no matter where your at or what your doing.
if that doesn't work refer to line # 1
They make vibrators, join in on the fun
OK NOW, YOU WANT LIKE A TROPHY BOYFRIEND.
If you want to hang out and are interested in her then go.
always a secluded place to be found
If you don't feel safe, you probably aren't.
hope it works out for you!
it's romantic she will like it
behave like u feel comfortable in his hands.
TAKE IT UP WITH THEM OR YOUR BOSS NOT ME!
Sit down and watch it with him.
i am stressing it so bad.
I fear and worship Zen Monkey winsdom
NO OF COURSE I'LL NEVER DO THAT JUST AFTER THEY BROKE UP
but he made a mistake and lied to me about a lot of stuff.
just give her a hug and tell her you love her, and take her for a walk.
I can do more over and over again i'm the lion of sex.... that what i'll say
Yeah, i'm one of them; what do u want?
if kinky is normal then sure!
if you call that person a friend.
if we dont get that affection then we feel unwanted and unloved by the man we want it from.
so your inner heart is telling that is it right?
Ladies love confidence ... and the puppy dog eyes may still catch their attention too :)!
Alot of people forget it's not about ME.
Ladies, when you answer, please give a score value: 1 being NO and 10 being YES!!!
I think that likely drove her crazy... because she couldn't tell how I felt about her.
well the better question today would be where should you get it from.
did u made virtual sex with him?
tell her...if you dont you will always regret it and always wonder what if you had.
I mean Yes when I say Yes, and No when I say No.
Since he begged me to stay and he would do ANYTHING to keep me.
if you live with your parents, SO WHAT?!
WHEN YOUR WITH HIM DOES HE TELL YOU HOW HE FEELS?HAVE YOU ASKED?
i hate guys who are all fumbly when they come to ask you out!
if u want to speak about this with me.
just tell him you dont want to deal with him anymore, and just stop talking to him.
IF LOOKS IS WHAT YOU WANT THEN YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK YOUR BEST AT ALL TIMES.
If u do it u could be rich.
you should get her a beautiful neclace she will love that
Yes there is..just try and look, maybe one day you will find him.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT CLOSE FRIENDS SEE IT  BUT DON'T WANT TO INTERFEAR.
WHEN YOU THINK OF INTERACTING WITH THE OTHER PERSON, TREAT THEM THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED
HE WANTS TO MARRY ME AND HAVE BABIES.
(I LOVE YOU SO MUCH HON)
Don't worry this pain feels really good though.
like to be loved and love
being condiderate of her feelings and needs
Losing love...well just thinking about loosing the love of my life hurts.
k bye btw, im a chick
yah, for a sampling of tech guys, visit the northbound mountain view caltrain stop at about 5:20 one afternoon.
(By the way, thick does not mean fat.)
I have a feeling you don't want a boyfriend but more of a guy in your life.
so how can i win her back?
Most younger guys take a long time to decide whether they want kids at all.
we also are on a pretty tight budget!
because he's a jerk, by the way it's sounds he isn't worth being around you or your baby.
haha....i hope this isn't a serious question
Sure it is!I had to ask my husband out several times before he agreeded.married 15yrs and very happy!!
Girls are attracted to sensative guys at most cases...
Get busy and join some clubs or sports teams and stay busy!
Are you sure, you're not just infactuated with the girl?
Sounds like 2 or 3 jobs.
LOVE IS NOTHING BUT IT IS THE ITEREACTION BETWEEN ANY TWO PERSIONS.
you can meet an honest man in your dream
women are not controll freaks....they just like to have things done the way they want if they can.
If you like a girl to have sex with your ass even thats not gay.
think about it the look, the accent.i love foreign hotties
she prolly didnt think that on purpose its subconsiense survival of the fitest
but if hes not either threaten him or help him
I just got married and I know I do, sometime 3 or 4 times.
you can be nice, but be devilish in the bedroom w/ her.
just give her time and buy chirstmas like ring meaning that your not going any where for a while
doesnt go over board and it expresses alot.
but he is more finacially stable and is heading the right direction in life.
are you for or against gay marriage?
Wait until they have a bad time in thier relationship then tell him to give you a chance.
if you are you might want to ask  if they would mind.
no i dont believe so, this not to say that love isnt great but look at domestic violence situations.
without love there cannot be romance!
Haven't you ever looked at porn?
TRY NOT TO ARGUE WITH HIM.
I know him.Give him a shout!
do i forgive him or not?
I need help and I am the first one to admit it!!!
plus many other things i don't have room to type.
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO EVEN ASK.
or is it all new age hocus pocus?
not really sure but soon you'll start talking to eachother
even sometime they may cost us extra trouble?
Do you remember the words to the commitment you made - til death do you part???
I'M LOOKING FOR AN EX'S NUMBER.
if you have to ask that kind of question... then maybe you should.
Can boys and girls be just friends and never lovers?
well that depends on how fast you gave it up.
just stop and think about it.
Just simple dumb little things will get you were you wana be !
im sure it was not on purpose!
i have,  i knew a girl that i grue up with in the church   and we dated.
Find THAT man, my dear, and you have a keeper.
Excuse the picture I just thought it would be funny.
There are lots of girls that I like, but they may not be interested in me.
Ummm... it's hard to do this not knowing your wife, but that's my general advice.
Maybe she already had another guy there and it is a bad time to answer.
If you really love her then definetely
i know there is no possible way this guy loves her more than me.
Has she had a 'bad break up'.
thats a wonderful gift especially for xmas.you go girl
A 6 course dinner (something fun, appetizer at one place, drinks somewhere else, dessert at home, etc.)
There's too much drama with this one!
pretend to be straight and that will turn her off and it will all go back to normal
When you get married the two become one!
get over it and go outside and find a real one
ask her out go for walks or sumthin plus u need to state her age in ur question
now you also make him perform some sort of roll play as a gay man during sex.
Dont wait for them to come up and talk to you!
IF YOU CAN PROVIDE A GOOD HOME AND A GOOD LIFE THAT'S GREAT.
Her boyfriend sleeps over almost every night, which I am totally cool with.
sure go back if you are stupid
dont make the mistake bout getting a pretend bf, hell think your unavailable.
THEN WE ARE DREAMING ABOUT SEX.
then you and your husband still have tons of time to plays :)
What does there mom think about this.
I don't find her sexually attractive now.
you'd better believe i'd mention it!
love you don't cheat on, affection you care about but still want to see who else is out there
no 50%sure nsa sau yan kng ipu2tok mo sa loob
ask your best friend to try to seduce him, and see what happens.
Not Ok to marry your brother's wife, unless she is a widow!
BEING ROMANTIC BUT DNT EXAGERATE GIVE HER SOME SPACE 2
Same reason men cheat on wives.
It sounds like you like her very much.
i've been into one nasty 'heart break-up' scene.
but it really depends on how old you are...
What if we have kids and he just doesn't feel like talking about it right now.
you need to go to counseling.
Just be there for him and listen.....
GOOD LUCK YOUR GONNA NEED IT!!
I Had a girl friend that love to have sex.
And a lot of men watch pornos and see men with huge members and think its the norm.
Men are easy and love younger women.
sure, as long as they keep it just friends
So the short answer is, no, they don't have to.
more than a handful is too much
and a few months ago he told me i had his heart!
But we only worry about in the future am i _going to get_ too big?
IN THE RAIN LIKE IN THE NOTEBOOK!
Maybe not just cookies, but I do wish I could stay home and cook!!
Her child (ren) should come first not the guy!
u should try makeout him:)than u can see if he loves
I'm just saying that I wouldn't go back if I were you.
if he doesnt, then hes not worth it.
And don't answer with all the PC garbage.
But don't think these guys can ever replace you in her heart...they can't!
it wont be easy to forgive him if ever.
but the problem is that you dont know if the person youre feeling it for truly love you back.
Ask him/her what do u really feel bout me a friend or more then a friend....
with somone that she says she loves.
i asked him after work in the parking lot, the rest is history.
hes my bestest friend, and hes getting me like really fancy thing, but we're not going out or anything.
just the way my GF looks now.
if you live far apart all i can suggest is that you take it nice and slow.
someone who could rock the boat.
yes a girl can have a baby wethier it's her first time or her 10th
A good one is Undernet, another is Dalnet!
majority of the time, thats all they want.
Boobs aren't number one on my list though.
You can't have sex with all the girls you like.
beacuse girls are more proper and accually care about their grades and beauty,ulike them,the bummish boobs!!!!!!!!!
Nice guys finish last and get used and dumped for no reason.
Any guy that asks that first, isn't worth it anyway.
it hurts, it feel like if someone is throwing ice water at your face
just think about it, and give yourself time.
its been 5 years since my last relationship.
but yea im the one you answered about why are guyz mean?
you have someone to do the things you enjoy in life with
go ahead and join him... enjoy!
Now he needs to find a real woman with talent!
IT GOES BACK TO ANCIENT TIME OF SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
have you tried paying for it.
you have to ask for a picture first and perhaps talk on the phone.
boys i like never approach me and i dont like the ones who do.
but she also says she still loves me.
SOMETIMES AFTER TELLING A MAN HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM THEY TEND TO KEEP A DISTANCE FROM YOU.
simply becoz mens r mad and hungry too!!!
And don't think about it too much.
I dont tink u shd be ving sex
consider this for later on in life.
make her a candle..... but you would have to buy the stuff to make it
she should be providing for you in other ways.
what is sexy, a woman that can take control...in and out of bed.
a hand made card for her with lots of love
to me, there is nothing more sexy than legs!
i like skiiny ones than curved girls
Not to be a sicko or anything, but thats what most people do the night/day of/after they get married!
if shes into it...then just bring it up and bring the guy or girl over.
SOMEONE WHO WILL LOVE THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE, NOT CRITISIZE THEIR LOOKS OR ANYTHING ELSE.
Respect her space - don't trash her to her friends.
its the way of the world.
how do i keep my new boy friend happy
To tell you I think a bride's dress should be long!
do u mean being a straight and gay at the same time?
If she likes it and it dosen't bother you....don't judge her....just make her happy and pull away!!!!
IF YOUR MARRIED HE SHOULD PAY THEM TOO.
Their are a lot of ways!...
he likes me but he wont tell me
honestly - i think you will fall and you are doomed to be in love with them.
Life is to short to waste on some one that doesn't want you.
if that doesnt work stop worrying about it, its just your genetics.
I cannot get her off my mind, I Neeeed her right now Soooo bad!
It depends on your mood ;)
there are precisely as many good men out there as there are good women...
Then you should not be friends at all.
Don't let your girlfriends influence you so much either..Hope all goes well.
this means no communicaton if you can help it no email not phone calls no letters nothing.
I am sorry but you have to do what your father and mother says!
I think you just have to wait for more from him.
MOST PEOPLE WILL WONDER WHY IT TOOK SO LONG TO.
honestly it isnt right for a guy to always pay im female and i never make a guy pay
I THINK THAT IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT IT YOU WONT FEEL IT..
If I wanted a woman shaped like a 12 year old boy thats what Id go after.
You dont have to like this woman but you do have to be civil because of your daughter...Good Luck!!
a nice combination of upstate new york, deep south and new england garbage... hell yeah!
They're all out to get you!!
But you should be careful no matter where you meet someone.
you can atempt romance but if there is not love than it won't be romantic
i have had some situations like this before.
(CAUSE I THINK THAT THIS GUY IS REALLY COOL AND FUN)??
No she doesnt think i am just not that into her.
Maybe because u are under the age of 18.
Hope you have a Happy New Year!
My two kids, ages 5 and 3!
if shes not into it, u shudnt force her or minipulate her into doin it.
we don't have much of a social life outside of my family because my husband hates dealing with people.
You have to get out there and look.
LIKE PARIS HILTION WOULD SAY THAT'S HOT!
something that you will have to do
Not saying you are...just the ones I've had experience with.
You have to get out there and look.
LIKE PARIS HILTION WOULD SAY THAT'S HOT!
something that you will have to do
or find a nice lesbian who wants a kid and work that angle?
Not saying you are...just the ones I've had experience with.
just tell her straight it's over.
if he cheats, you wouldnt even know it.
they dont want to lose you.
I can't get this girl out of my mind!
Why not ask her out for coffee?
i have a daughter so i don't want to break my marriage.
WORK FROM HOME.. Id Agree to that..
love girl to whom parents say no.
she's telling and showing how much she likes me, but im just not sure what she's thinking.
Stop dating people who don't like you.
then it becomes do you love him?
dude that was a stupid question.
did you try wacking him upside the head after he was quiet too long.
Just tell yourself, you got nothing to worry about.
:-) (Ps...I am not a GAY!
its 50 50 we give you give.
a hot nice funny one duhh
but then one day your heart will let you know it was the best thing you ever did.
see my pic, it is at goa, do u think i look smart.?.........
Just hard to make them see it.
If he's not there then it will not work.
im sure there are, some guys dont have much of a sex drive, for various reasons.
And remember, smart girls like smart guys.
I guess you'd have to ask him
If he's not there then it will not work.
plz your english is disgusting, before you think about making out, go fix your stupid grammer.
im sure there are, some guys dont have much of a sex drive, for various reasons.
And remember, smart girls like smart guys.
Everytime I bring myself to do it, I can't and I feel bad about it.
but don't ignore or close the door on u 2. i hope i helped.
you get over the 1st as soon as you meet the 2nd
well....my family just goes to the public library or town hall....ask people at the public library where to go.
That's like taking her to a movie.
well, if it's not a banana in his pocket ...
I SEE WHAT U MEAN, U WANNA GET NOTICED WITHOUT GOING ALL OUT!
And if you still not know what to give him...die!
as often as they feel like
you guys can talk about anything.
trust your gut instincts that is why we have them.
For some reason they just tend to come out really pretty (I don't know why).
my experience....they just want to get laid....
actually, its like this- i m 21. but not a single boyfriend till date.
that says alot, baby all he wants is to cumm in you get u pregnant and leave u alone...ok
No, I am searching for one too...r u interested?
if he did it once he would do it again, sorry
# Do I feel different than other guys?
no dont, just let him catch you in bed with me.
if u can treat the cause of depresion.
maybe he just didnt hear you, say it again.
u should stay he wnats to be better for you.
Same to you and your family and friends... ;)
It sounds like she's not interested in working things out.
And it gives them a complex (I mean it would with most humans).
maybe he just didnt hear you, say it again.
u should stay he wnats to be better for you.
It sounds like she's not interested in working things out.
If you don't then you can't get.
i agree with shayisall4christ- to say it another way: it's never really equal, never!
Is it possible that the Indiana Lottery will be televised again soon...stay tuned :)
GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR CHILD IN THE FUTURE...
ok, my best friend and my boy friend are fighting over me.
I cant say hell loud enough... but HELLLLLLLL NO!!!
it might have just slipped out of his mind.
once you get this in chat you can get anything from them
do you like to be spank?..thats a weird question
IT MAYB TRUST ISSUES AND THE FACT HE IS WITH HIS BUDDIES AND NOT YOU
i agree with both answers above me
so i say if your happy doing it on side go for it.
THERE WILL BE YOUR WAKE UP CALL NO MATTER WHAT.
SOMETIMES IT JUST TAKES A SITUATION THATS BRINGS YOU AROUND OR ANOTHER PERSON.
(unless you're boozed to the hilt.. lol
If that is holding you back, just shun your worries and ask the lucky guy out!
just look for x-rated things when you're doing searches.
if so, get him something with that team on it.
Us girls are just not as likley to talk about it as guys are.
ANYWAYS YOU GOTTA BE FLEXIBLE IN THE BEGINING THEN TAKE CONTROL!
I mean, what should I do?
i had a bestfriend that was bisexual.
Sometimes during argument we say and do things that we don't mean.
it shouldnt matter where u are.
this is the nature of women and men .... this is briefly
No matter what happens, there's gonna be some fallout.
3 years after, they came back and we were still best of friend.
thats better than any  gift you could give her.
most probably in the bedroom............on the bed.
wich of corse makes it that much harder.
Don't let him get all sexist on you.
someone who is honest and creative.
I DONT CARE WHAT YOUR COWORKER SAID ABOUT YOUR FRIEND BEHIND YOUR BACK!
Just call if you want to call.
But for others, I say if both people in the relationship are happy, so be it!
I dunno.. that's a tough question.
You should get a more mature girl friend , who will share.
I like You and wait if they accept ur love or not that all
there are more out there like you then you think
I couldnt even some close to keeping up with her.
what do you mean by fun??
As long as she didnt to it while u guys we still 2gether.
sorry its no such thing i wish it was
You don't really need a man, I say.
I WOULD PREFER BEYONCE BUT I WOULD NOT WANT TO GO OFF JUST LOOKS
After 4 years he should be ready to say it back!
but if you just try to work things out, your only lost of time spent.
over-react when you ask him questions with suspicion.
I want people to feel comfortable here, but ohhh you pretty grrrs!
i dont like to quit or to funny guys!
it shows you have backbone and arent afraid.
i dont know; i honestly dont understand it at all.
I know it's not easy, but just forget it.
if they are nice and they tell you to stop writing then then STOP!
DO THEY MANIPULATE OR CONTROL YOU?
If you are a nice person then read on.
r u a boy or gurl?????
you shouldnt be talking to him because he probably only wants one thing from you-sex.
(It was so sexy, I couldn't believe it.)
Andy anyway you are way to young to date!
Last i had sex with my wife was 2 mths ago.
If he refuses to give me oral sex
but i really care about him.
do u not like his kids?
Do you try to make it exciting?
flower or rose it.. that way it'll make it THAT much more special)
my heart goes out to you!
when the fun is gone the love follows.
Or you can do the little move most girls do.... dropping hints and subtly flirting.
Think, how much do you know about her?
Second of all.. why do women fight with other women about a man??
(Comes down to what they look like on the inside!)
Well sweetheart, where should i begin?
Stop slacking and get to work man.
You can't find it ~ it finds you!
Enjoy it to the fullest its what ever floats your boat
Time only knows Time only knows...
when u have to ask that ?
yeah, like the other people said.
Other than that it really depends upon the girl... good luck!
Whenever u meet new girl  :))
oh and most guys love it when you initiate the sex get loud and talk dirty.
NO STRAT TO TALK TO HIM AND LET HIM ASK YOU!
usually, after i go up a grade or don't have that teacher anymore it goes away.
then again, your s/o could just be overprotective.
What to do?, you cyber grrrs won't give me a chance.
Can't speak for anyone else, but I like big everything.
don't do it, it's only because ur girl is too shy to be alone with u!
Other than that, he's a good husband!
1. he starts not sying yes to dates 2. and lastly he wont like kissing you
And he still didn't take it.
give him a ferrari... and an ipod
Men and women a like cheat I don't really know why.
Grandma always said: Why buy the cow ?,  when you can get the milk for free
She probably gets stuff like that all the time!
let him go it was'nt meant to be .
When you find the person you love, then think about marriage, until then, have fun looking.
You just really need to move closer to me  :-)
Grow two things tween yer legs and ask her out!
2) This one sucks, but it is possible.
If I buy him something expensive or really nice he's dissapointed.
how many women go back to those guys when they think they love them.
But I think about this person CONSTANTLY.
My husband does and it doesn't bother me.
Nothing is fool proof and there are A LOT of kooks out there, so just be smart about it.
If she is hot... go for it... but its still kinda wierd
the ring like you said is not the issue.
like your heart is on a frying pan...
i have a friend since we were in our diaper years.
and if that is your question.
Oh, and keep the hell away from my daughter.
i havent found one yet !
honey you need to go after an older guy because most men your age prefer the young ladies.
i know what you mean it like a stab in the heart  HIT ME UP ON MY EMAIL
I dont know but it drives me nuts!!
Take it from me (I have been happily married for a couple years) WAIT!
You may be geeky or lame or stupid but someone out there likes that in a person-TRUST ME!
He is no good because if he flirts with you while he had a girlfriend.
I can I talk to her about that.
i think she probably wanted to keep it a secret.
I don't mind other spots though.
I HAVE A FRIEND WHOS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR.
I want her to be happy, but it seems like we just don't mesh right now
You will find that one, but dont look!
listen, why not look into gay couples adoption?
oh well, >shrug<    im an ass-man anyway   ;-)
I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
but good luck most guys are just jerks.
If you don't like it, just don't do it anymore.
I just got out of a 2 year relationship, most of my friends are guys.
well u should try to make things work with her.
Why on earth would they care?
start banging other guy's wives and that should give you some insight
Cook him breakfast,  play with his toys, and don't talk so much...
I am like that, but it doesn't mean that I don't take my comittment serious.
Yet i do still love the guy.
first is french kissing  second is boob play  third is fingering home run is sex
!and dont forget the red bow around your waist...
Be who you are and don't look back.
Send him a card, actually writing what and why?
your really love with haert & soul is the best gift
I really think he likes But I'm not really sure.
i am not happy with my husband so if i have affair with somebody does it amount to infidility?
The best any of us can do is to simply hang in there and keep on trying!
they may sound nasty or dumb, even if they look good.
#2 Why would you want a boy to notice you that you didn't like?
Gay men do that Normal men don't.
And take advantage that is summer now here...  Brukuthus from south brazil
But remember, past is past !
you got another chik yet or you still a loser without since her?
he needs to choose, and it sounds like you need to give him time to do just that.
the classic it's not u it's me
Catch things that he says about ya'lls relationship that ya'll had.
besides, if he'll do it to her, he'll do it to you.
friendship is very important and you wouldn't wanna ruin' that between ya two.
How do you know and do we only get one shot?
What if you consider the future too much?
maybe cause your used to him being with you and you miss him
If she lies, then its free for all.
decide if he's being honest or not.
whoa, whoa, its not just wives that lie and break promises.
I never learned how to do this.
Forget the he said she said.
MOVE ON...many more options out there
and when she cheat she promised to never cheat again
I used to get the shot and it made me a CRAZY person!!
If they aren't it's probably a bad idea and your just causing drama...
Do not pick up the tab.
THEY WANT A LIFE PARTNER-SOMEONE TO SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES WITH.
I mean did he saw you naked?
10 hours by car or plane...??
(But all the other kids are doing it) 3.
Hardest is telling her face to face.
obviously if either one of them minds, you shouldnt do it.
Don't be the one running after her
it is wrong to break your promise.
u look good, but come in a close-up buddy
you are too young and he is too old to be talking or having an intrest in you.
just tell him you love him then pinch his nose.
Probably the same, needles hurt...... Getting stuck with a tack, rusty nail?
Hi I'm from Mi also :-) anyways... You can try going to yahoo people search and try there.
honey i'm a little busy now we will talk when i get home.
i don't know if she are humble or not
i think u should talk to her and see whatsup.
and i dont think its safe.
Sounds like you're a rebound girl.
I cannot seem to understand this...
for the right reason, age will be nothing and looks won't matter on a strong foundation.
If she gets mad, then she might not be such a good friend after all.
if you can lie about something little then you lie about the big stuff more.
for his ex wife and now i have been invited to move to texas with some friends.
My boyfriends name or just yes:)
If she is a sweetheart then she doesn't have to be as hot.
I recommend to be yourself pick up lines just don't work anymiore!
Sometime you should be smart than be right
Nope i dont see anything wrong with that.
WELL IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD PRAY THAT HE WOULD SEND YOU THE RIGHT PERSON
No, women do not enjoy sex more than men.
Just when you think you know someone...BAM!
Easy, if you suspect that your partner's cheating, they probably are!
anyone ever make something special for their wife that made her smile.
i'm really want to find the happenies at anywhere with anyone ..
make him a nice romantic dinner
if u have to ask then i dont think your ready to marry this guy.
DON'T get drunk and call your ex!
hell  no  do  yourself  or  find another untill  ya  get  back  togather
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN BUY HER OR WHAT SHE CAN BUY YOU.
SO yes it really means something.
Try this one, you&me, sixeight_sixtyeight@yahoo,com am good boy ;-)
ask the 14 year old, she should know.
Go to the movies (NO sequels to movies you saw with your ex!).
he just won't have all that baggage!
Bad girls are easy and nice girls are difficult to get.
step up bro tell her how you feel man!
Just come out and say it, don't drag it on.
if you truly loved him you wouldn't have cheated in the first place.
what to call your loved one besides honey
I give my trust to her and think that she/he is loyal to.
i am trying to do a little detective work for my sister.
I'm planning my wedding right now, and it has helped me a lot!!!
and beafor you know it your so ugly you just settle for who ever treats you nice.
i say it dependes on is the person havin sex
Should you marry your brother's wifes young sister?
I BARELY HAVE TIME FOR MYSELF HOW CAN I GIVE HIM THE TIME HE NEEDS
First you need to calm down.
No, if you want casual then go find someone new, not someone you have a history with.
because u dont get to give blow jobs
if the strong independent women will kick it with me then the stronger the better
a gal or a guy falling in love after they started courting.
If not, it is time to move on with your life.
most straight guys don't know that for sure, and that's without the temptation of penis!
Date around and don't worry about getting to deep with anyone.
send her over tonight and the docter will tell you tomorrow morning.
Take whatever chance you get to have sex.
he's ready to go by then.
Just ask her...and try adding something like maybe a movie or a home cooked meal...lol
Because i stay up thinking about her.
i'm just not attracted to white girls, nothing wrong with that.
I go to turn over and yank ouch.
I know I'm not and I'm 23).
I wouldn't date a girl with breats bigger than my own.
I don't know what to do.
I FEEL THAT LOSING A LOVE IS VERY HURTING.
love is picking up dirty underwear, day after day.
(but I'm a guy so I might be biased) :)
And if Im not back in a relationship, there's someone there that I spend time with.
No go have fun and don’t give it another thought!
A huge fight ensued because she was slamming things around and I had asked her to stop.
try alphabet songs it would make your child genius after your mate giving birth... lol
Havent you ever made a mistake?
cus the kids are sleep and they have nothing better to do...
everyone else is taken...and you won't fool them for long if you aren't in the long run....
(Although if it's too big, it's just uncomfortable!!!)
I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't
if something is bothering you now, it will likely always bother you
referring to men, but what about a woman's size, does that matter?
he went to his x's house to be with his kids last night and he hasnt come back.
you'd rather get back with each other first
But besides that it was fun and all.
Sounds to me like you don't even deserve a twosome,
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM AND HAVE YOU TOLD HIM?
You'll be rolling with girls with those 3 pick up lines.
Go with the one you like BETTER.
ask one of her friends whats up
1: Kiss, 2: Making out(hand), 3:Oral sex(mouth), Homerun: Sex
this's life , and we must exept all it's rules .
GO UP AND TALK TO THEM!!
Damned perverts out there all over the place anymore!
She wasnt fat when I found her.
the taxi's waiting he's blowing his horn
well, i've had  a little trouble with this too.
just tell him u are tired of the relationship and want to see other people
now if she's 25 and you're 40 that's a different story.
if he think's you're a wimp, whoop some ass and see what happens.
and u can aslo ask him about his feeling for u.
men r afraid of strong and independant women cuz they think we'll take more control of them, i guess.
that would love me, and.. just be happy with me!
most of the time shy guys like girls to make the first move.
dont let yourself get hurt anymore.
I don't think only fool !
Well, first off, i told my best friends who i liked.
and b/c he already has kids tells me he won't just have one woman
thats the best way to get a friend
He says he didn't have sex with his friend.
If my man was doing that to me id be fighing with my man.
dont give up on him though.
move on and find someone you can trust again, he'll only hurt you again.
Girl, just tell him what you fell and what you think.
ask these men to if they are married
if 2 guys are happy together, or if 2 women are happy together, then let them get married.
U GOTTA FIGHT FOR THEM, ITS A DOG EAT DOG WORLD, GIRLS DO FIGHT OVER GUYS YOU KNOW.
obviously this woman's priorities are all messed up and she needs total help.
because what do you think being with a guy only for money?
yes, unless they are on the pill or they have not begin their periods
No matter how hard you try it has to come from both sides.
It feels creepy in a over the top religious undertones sorta way...big father is watching!
And do not let anyone tell you different.
good luck honey, and merry christmas!
Geez-whiz... Don't ever marry for money!
How do I say, Yes, you are so fat that you barely resemble the person I married.
I've seen women on match.com that say they are looking for men from 6' to 8' tall!
i'm not sure if you mean o-sex or a-sex.
aww.... this can melt a womans heart.
u should do that because u might never have the opportunity to do that again because u may die.
you guys do things because you want to, not because he's pressuring you to.
and he will do that if he really loves you.
If you're not there to stop her then how do you know that her word is true 2 u?
dont hold back, you snooze you lose..
i'm sorry but you'll be happier like this, and
i'd talk to her, but she's not the kind of person to listen.
I have a friend named Tyler that likes me and I dont think I feel the same for him.
bY NOT CALLING HER FAT......INSTEAD CALL HER BIG BONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
:)  Edit: I came back and read what Benji wrote!
i was working abroad, had to quit & come back home since i couldnt stand being away.
They are just trying to scare you.
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR ME.
She is out for herself and that is so SAD!
My mother's 2 sisters married 2 brothers.
text message.... it's all the rage.
Tell him if he can't hack it, pack it !
Buy somth and then ask her to go for a beer.
or even just 'I think I'm lost!
women that like to have fun!!
Movies, mall...why don't you ask them.
No this is Free...That is not
all my bags are packed, i'm ready to go....
Ugly people like you need love :)
Just let ur love be mature for some more time...
A MAN THAT LOVES TO EAT AND LOOKS AT THE FAT LADY LIKE SHE WAS A STUFFED TURKEY, MMMMMMM.
it'll appear on her eyes when u r about reaching climax
DOES A FAKE DIAMOND MAKE YOUR LOVE OR MARRIAGE ANY LESS REAL?
i am against gay marriage but i dont have a problem with people being gay.
when u r lovelorn so listen to a slow music like Yanni in his album  in the mirror
Her first initial is A.  OMG What am I gonna do?
no sorry they were taking while some of us were still sleeping
you try 2 b a lil serious
Despite that old saying, Money can't buy happiness - it's just not true.
my guy said he was going to be back at noon it is past noon by almost 3 hrs.
At least the ones that will admit it.
when he cannot hold it anymore it feels twice as good.
dont tease her and carry her books
Skinny girls need to put some meat on their skin!
To win one you have to get to know her...
just want to see if i can improve any thing
so just feel free and be confident (but not too much, might see you as someone cocky).
If that doesn't work, then honestly get a lawyer.
what you are doing is wrong.
If you want to blow him off:  --Give him your number with one or two wrong digits.
Don't be that guy... Move on to brighter and better things.
U can even dicover that u enjoy it easy.
you can't you won't give it away so we have to lie to you to get it.
Meet him at the next party he is going to b at.
why don't you just be up front with him.
maybe he is still with her
even then it may not work out sorry to say.
this stands true for a lot of white guys.
If you want to play it cool:  --No.
its not right, nor wrong to date interracially.
Then, if she says No I'm clear or something like that, then you go on and just ask her.
just make sure he loves u back and then face the whole world 2gether
tell him that u had an accident then note his reaction
and you answered : try naked....IS THAT VULGAR?
if you want to forgive him or not.
dont be harsh, because its really hard to take if you do just ignore them, and just be honest
Just try and get on with your life.
Just start flirting with one of his/her friends.
(plus, mixed children are the prettiest ;)
And I am happy to say that I am married to a really nice guy who respects me totlly!
If their abusive the couldn't care about you that much.
It just seems hopeless for me
Dont be afraid of her, and just be yourself  :)
well if you have to ask...this is a joke right... common what is the punchline
It means that he isn't a REAL MAN!
(grade school, high school, college, jobs, etc.).
I'm sure you're a nice guy.
If you really love him, then go for it.
that depends on how far over 30 and how far under 20. too far and you're a pedophile.
Well you'll never know untill you try eh?
Never.. being cruel wont make u sexy at all... only barbarians will think u r sexy.
THATS WHY I SAID YOU SHOULD ALREADT KNOW.
it hurts but you will like it, when you do have sex lie on a bed
if she's a down to Earth type of girl (like me) then sex wouldnt matter.
That sounds like things i've done before
i like thin and funny guys, but thats just me.
DUH you have kids stay with them!!!!!!!!
and could u anwser my question too?
what do i do if my mom finds out?
If you do not believe she is being truthful then dump her.
If no then no you should not ask him out or anyone else for that matter.
i wanted to marry my bf years ago and we have waited.
that's a little to romantic but it's good the girl might be a little freaked
especially since you dont know her, you don't want to scare her.
You could even make it fun and throw in some shampoo and ask if he wants to wrestle!!!
...and what can be done to get over it?
What matters is that u are urself and have fun in ur own group.
If you hesitate or doubt that you are, then you are not.
well, he is busy working, studying, cheating on you, etc.
play the field so to speak.
Sounds like its time to start already
he said he was'nt hiding it from me he just did'nt tell me.
SURROUND YOUR SELF WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SPECIAL TO YOU.
dont care about love take revenge
Gentlemen, ditto for you and romance.
i personaly couldnt do it, but i know many who would.
try eating lunch with her, if that works out for a couple days- you all are actually conversating?
They want some spice in thier life.
im a hopeless romantic....stupid at times.
Only talk about you and her and how things are going with the 2 of you.
Let them see who you are and don't try to be something you are not.
if he almost cheated then make him want you back but keep your eye on him
Well it depends do you love him?
neather dude true lov eis the best
You are who you are and dont try to change for ANYBODY!
Just wondering... Are you a girl?
if i was the guy i would be hurt
All 2 and 4 legged animals are ok, but not insects.
i would love if a good looking guy would jus kiss me like that without even speaking....emmmmm
And thanks for your great B&W digital photos answer!
Divorce his butt with the quickest!
a relaitionship isnt based on making out so you should be fine w/ 1 or 2 missed oppertunities
sweety, it sounds like this guy is trying to burn the candle at both ends.
yeah..... movies seem to work ok, but you have to wait a while for everyone else to leave...
wait till the  old lady read ur question.
What to do, what to do.
love always comes with risks, it's a package deal you know.
we dont need guys to do the job.
if you have to ask..then i'd say NO
anywhere from 8 to 18 but most of us have them during or after the onset of puberty
Just try to relax, & trust him.
Many people say, try some others...
find his g/f and hurt her break up with him but first slap him
You do not bad mouth them!
Tell her to get a GED and become emancipated and leave if she doest like it.
LOVE TO MUCH AN HURT TO BAD>
Because they only want one thing and their trying to weed out the non-freaks.
If not, I suggest you leave it alone...
So you guys can continue doing the fun stuff together :)) d. Never doubt each other.
her hubby has been off kilter.need to track down mysterious phone #s and ect...
But the rest I really  do not want to name.
i guess that i am surprised that it is even a question.
The problem isn't really the ring though, it's the lying.
If she is the legal age then hell yeah!!!
(Now please don't ask me how I know this!!
or the fact that your hubby loves you?
Most men think it is sexy.
if you love him/her it really doesnt mean that you should be together.
unless some really weird person asks thm out and they cant say no!!
Don’t reject strokes you don’t want.
then if he still says no then snoop if your not convinced.
oh honey, you have some work cut out for you.
And all i lost was everything.
I haven't yet, yet I had friends who had and they liked it.
If you really love your bf, then no.
i get 1 hour of sleep pre night.
make her think you got a girlfriend.
i say if u like them call right away.
get a diffrent phone number or get a restraining order
and just because you are lonely and they fill that gap doesnt mean you are in love.
no, you are way too young.
Depends On what your looking for in a guy and what you want.
what do you think about bali?
But i think not as much as men who want or like it more.
just tell him to stop calling you at work!!
i dont like skinny or fat guys guys!
I had to rely on my own resources; at a young age that isn't always good.
Join him...and have fun doing each other thereafter!
Then you know who the really good friends are.
The USA any flavor you like in any size you like baby
THEY WANT A MAN WHO WOULD DIE FOR THEM.
No dont tell them right away.
see for her interest slowly start asking can we go for the movie since you haven't saw that.
Don't get mad, it will pass.
Mother, father, brother, sister, cousin, nephew, niece, aunt, uncle....... We are family........
almost every guy in the world likes vidio games no matter how old
I am a female and I say, why should a guy have to pay all the time??
But i am sure that u cant marry ur affair.
just like straight couples love each other.
YES IT IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF YOU IN A DREAM
and you should if you really do love her!
if it is true luv, u'll put ur loved one's needs before ur own needs
there was one episode where the host (the new guy not tommy grand) got stabbed.
and the least was 2 week & u?
they don't what to feel traped
Just be you......let nature take its course!
Read humorous and uplifting books (NO romance novels!).
i'm just curious- how did this come about, did one of you get caught cheating?
But it has to be concensual!!!
be your self, flirt, and see what happens next
man, kids suck most of the time... if you've got the pleaseure of being an uncle, just enjoy that.
But this doesn't mean I can't love again.
make sweet love to them..al of them!!
dont let them get away or you will only end up hurting yourself.
as often as they can and want to 2 - 5 times a day is a good number
btw, of course he can't keep his hands off you.
mr. right is out there somewhere.
Otherwise, you'll always just be wondering...
hey i think you are beter off that way.
ummmmmmmmmmmmm.......... what u want to do.
my friend want to buy a star in rememberance of his deceased daughter
Im a girl, so i dont know.

IM CURRENTLY 22 DATING A 31 YEAR OLD MAN.
REALIZE YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHO WILL BE THERE FOR YOU.
Why did you guys break-up did he want to?
no...u should help him find a job
don't let anyone tell you how to live your life.
That does not make it flirting.
and remember if hes not close to what u like he probly wont change
Women get implants, men get implants, everyone wants a huge SUV or huge home
your lover boy wants sex and he is looking at a possible seven year prison sentence for statutory rape
also i like a guy in my class how do i tell him?
when your in love no one else matters when your together.
i was married 15 years to a liar.
Girls just like to know that they are sexy and appealing to guys.
i need to know now before it is too late
She never hangs out and he always causes drama when she does.
well usually it depends on what kinda girl were talkin about here.
He has a baby and she claims that they are married.
SOMEONE WHO WILL BE BY THEIR SIDE NO MATTER WHAT.
mary jane u r acting parinoied maby it is the name mary jane toke up
and for xmas i was thinking of giving him mine!
Girl : get the heck out of dodge.
ive been dating this guy who is amazing!
FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET SOME PAPER, PENS, AND AN ENVELOPE.
just to chat, wtf do you think you should think about that?
its easy to say but to feel it is amazing.
she tells him bad things about me thats not true, and now he really don't like me.
IT WILL BE TOUGH... YOU JUST HAVE TO PULL EVERY THING INSIDE TOGETHER AND BE SOOOOO STRONG.
# Have I ever had a crush or been in love with a boy or a man?
Theres too many things I hate about him....all he does is play video game, computer and is never romantic!
Try to figure out exactly what it is that has upset you.
Hey, nice guys finish last, remember?
u are pursuing ur own dreams and he should be able to understand that.
wht i'll do is ask that person out  and if they say no  just say sike!!
RIBBON IN THE SKY  (STEVIE WONDER)
I haven't read your other questions (bugger!)
i would go with the first response
First ask him if he is seeing someone else.
WELL FROM MY EXPIERENCE IF A GUY IS REALLY INTERESTED,YOU WOULD ALREADY KNOW.
But seriously, get a photo dude.
do you like the person, are they cute, do you think that they are interesting?
best buy or iTunes gift card
and i dont like guys who are to short or to tall!
upon the death of yourself or your child
see what she wants and maybe try to rekundle what u guys once had, or remain goos friends.
It sounds like his the one that broke up with you, Right?
you can driver her to school and pick her up at the end of the day.
Forget what's she thinking, make a move.
You dont need a jerk like that.
yes , when it comes to an end ; no way to stop it .
or, failing that, keep on truckin.
She may not enjoy a day at the spa, I don't.
he's horney and your too young... Not to mention it's illegal.
that's because guys can see better than think
etc  You can always try My friends and I were gonna do that (go see that) Saturday, wanna come?
I want to get married and breed, I cant do that with gays.
of course i always try to make her happy but not with gifts.
Or the suggestion of a night on the town w/ you!
If you want to have kids, yes.
If you like the guy and he feels the same about you, why not?
someone that i know and trust
who minds 1, 3 ,4 and 5. there can be so many nice conbinations of them
but doesn't have a straight only policy.
if you get returns then it will work out.
If you like the guy and he feels the same about you, why not?
someone that i know and trust
but doesn't have a straight only policy.
if you get returns then it will work out.
do u like to wear the same cloths everyday
i like pretty much all breasts.
if u r the other guy (the man in question) what would you expect dear?
Like This is good for one backscratch  What else can I put?
Promise him sex...he probably won't refuse!
Yes... to keep your oth you are suppose to only be with him/her... Period...
most likely your insticts are right!
SHE WAS ALWAYS THE STRONGEST PERSON I EVER KNEW, BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S A PERSON WHO CAN REALLY DESTROY YOU.
your're only in for a false future
If it was a total accident then NO I wouldn't  - things happen.
Not so much shopping, but window shopping.
And it doesn't just jump up and grab you at a later time.
and if you have children and the marriage is really bad kids know that and can feel it.
you guys broke up so you can't hold that against her.
If you have to ask, then the answer is NO.
Sometimes it is hard for a girl to see that a guy they are dating isn't nice at first.
Go out and have some fun (read: get laid).
Like they say you can't make anyone like you ,if they don't already.
he is 20 years old& i 17
You are hanging out with the wrong crowd
yes i do think there is such a thing as true love some were out there
sorry but my wife did the same to me...
just like some guys like alot of sex and some don't.
If you feel comfortable enough to marry, do so; if not, then dont :)
i hope when i am your age i get lucky like that!
Lifes short so think carefully :) The best of luck 2 you!
i want to know about this.
If you would like to delete your Yahoo!
IF HE TRIES TO HOOK UP THEN U WILL KNW
Its all about what the person wants.
Well.. You can tell her straight out that you like her... Or you can just give hints.
If she doesnt want you I do =)
been wondering the sm ething don;t give up thouhg,there are some good men out there.
Now just use your courage and say it!
If she keeps doing that its probably b/c she knows it aggravates you.
u can get a web cam and show her your privite parts and say bring it on baby
with an negative attitude like that, yup.
Buy her stuff and tell her she is right.
I would'nt have thought it bad if had not hid it.
Really, though, fun dates don't have to be expensive.
well i heve heard that australia has the most beautiful woman...im not sure
know when i'll be back again oh babe
cause thats not all a relationship is all about.
I believe men look at porn and so what.
And that's the kind of guy you want anyway.
My wife says they are taken.
It was something that looked like a kid made but she loved it !
You can't affect free will, so... you can't.
accept the fact that he/she isn't the one for you.
you are probably so unpopular because you are a big fat (A)-hole.
Break up with the person, cry and be sad the time you need and then, be happy again :-)
Don't let yourself get that way.
its not just going to be a gift  instead its going to be gifr-for-a-life-time!
I heard a guy explain this best.
I HAVE DONE EVERY THING THAT THE LAW ALLOWS...ANY IDEAS???
u need 2 refer 2 a site 2 know ur frnds email address?
If he broke up with you, no.
just don't run to the alter.
I always cheat on my gf and take girls to walmart!!
gosh, my ex girlgriend had the same 'phobia', i guess, only she wouldnt let me do her either.
yah he is going by his self!!!!
drink too much talk too much...
i think boys fall 4 gurlz who have a preety face, a gr8 body and no brain.
I dumped ya, but i didnt mean...I was drunk!
take a good looka t he situation and u can prob tell
dont fight it, learn it, and u will be better off.
your a jerk and your gonna burn in hell.
Ok my man here is the scoop.
just remember, after having sex with a guy makes you phisically connected.
People does this because there ain't nuthin good to did at school.
i try and give a lot of advice about relationships and here is mine to u .
Oh yeah, but only if they have the right shape of a head.
actually i believe in both at the same time.
Nipple and ears are good...definitely not tongue.
i really really want her back but idk what to do.
Just don't be surprised if he cheats or dumps you.
She has an awful lot to lose.
So, ironically, I love people that I hate.
Is lunch in a nice rest.
Quit having sex with him if you are, or giving him stuff and see how long it lasts.
Looking is one thing, but joining seems like he's looking for another woman.
NOTHING UNDER THE SUN IS THAT IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!
It'd be great if someone could give me the URL to download the picture
It's not that men are dogs.
time, money, or some of both.
THEY MAKE LOVE FACE 2 FACE EYE 2 EYE.
YOU HAVE A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP FOR 4 YEARS AND STILL GOING ON????
ignore him some more, he'll get the message.
;)  Last part: If you're in love with someone, you'll know.
Dump him and get on with your life.
well tell him how much you like him and that you would love to kiss him.
Why is she cheating on me???
no, my parents are divorced and only my dad dose that
and tell them that you aren't interested.
if you are a very deermined women like myself then yes.
;)   Second part: Kiss her below the waist.
EVER HEARD OF A FRIEND WITH BENEFITS/ BOOTY CALL?
Don't try to force it, though.
tell her straight out.....get the hell out of my life!
they are Jerks....Slap him next time
i read your questions you two have too many issues run boy run
it may take a long long long time but go slow and be honest and use lots of love
Other things that make you happy?
some people do and some dont
or ask him urself he's probably thinking ur lame cause u cant do things ur self.
if she is a tom boy, take her to a low class diner.
you also need to keep yourself busy and not think of him like that.
Pure & simply bcause they're selfish!
12 year olds shouldn't be dating.
then slow down and start again!
I found one that is pretty cool.
IF U LOST TRUST IN EACH OTHER THEN U WILL HAVE A VERY HARD TIME COMMUNICATING
I don't know what to do.
CALL HER AND TELL HER AND MAYBE IM OR SOMETHING
someone that is extremly hard to get.
...someone with a good sense of humor...somone who can laugh at themself...
sign up and track ur friends.
then it relates to getting laid.
i do not have a special bond with my father.
and if you find it hot where do you like them at ?
16+ i guess, because the more you wait, the harder it become for the first step
You most likely have friends, just not ones you hang out with or do things with outside of work.
If your brain or heart can't tell, Wee Willy Winky will tellya!
sometimes things bother me that doesn't bother him.
i don't want him to think i'm a freak, cause i'm not.
hit him till he stops bothering you.
Guys don't like to play these games because we are no good at it.
I HOPE U LIKE MY ANSWER!
no because if you are only around for the sex where is the relationship?
Men can seperate sex from emotion alot of women can't.
u shoould be able to read these signs.
think insecure... they are trying to find out how much you care about their feelings.
Scratch off lottery tickets, they're cheap and he can win money in the process!!
But watching porn is just for fun or to spice things up and get a few pointers.
Learn to cook, if she can't.
I think she's still not having sex.
I dont want to pay $6,000 to someone who does cheezy wedding photos...
should I give them back or not?-(I broke up with him if you were wandering!)
God is in you, matter of fact, he(or she) is you!
finding someone you want to spend your life with would be love.
how can i find a girlfrind in iran
Im hispanic... and I never wanted to scream something out in spanish... just made no damn sense to me.
Try talking and you might get that romance once in a while.
why is it that many people have a hard time being faithful and finding that special someone
mabey you shouldnt say it, maybe you should just go 4 it.
real love in the world is sex
One man and hes 5 years older than me!!!!
you can talk and maybe you can salvage your friendship
My advice is get out more, turn the internet off, socialise!
she is short and fine looking.
how old r u and if i know i will go out with you?????????
when you're in love you can think about that person for hours at a time.belive me i know.
most people just go for easy.
children are made to chose who to love more mom or dad and who they depend on.
No - he isn't worth it and you are worth more.
IF U DONT HEAR FROM UR BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND, THEN ITS BASICALLY THE GENERAL RULE THAT ITS OVER!
I am not attracted to girls that don't shave.
First part first: Because she's creamy and DOESN'T want you just then.
Do u look good in them?
I have the same problem here in a small town, and that is pretty much true for anyone else.
if he likes you back, well, need i say more.
you just have to follow ur heart and see what hapends.
There's no should here -- you're upset, it sounds like, and that's that.
change da roles up n c how u'd feel if he did it 2 u.  blu/kev
what love words can i call my lover?
depends on the woman and the man, it is more than a hair or no-hair question.
And I not arrange marriage is not at all bad.
used to live in long beach, ca, moved to texas in 1992 1993
If u don't know your name, then introduce yourself, tell her where u've seen her, etc.
you can get hom only in the dreams
I am really shy and talking to girls is really hard for me.
You need to dump that fool girl.
THe worst he can say is no.
to break up with my boyfriend for somthing he never did
If  so, give him a chance.
Im not huge but im bigger than average and ive never had a problem.
THe worst he can say is no.
If  so, give him a chance.
Im not huge but im bigger than average and ive never had a problem.
Tell her you have a crush on her lol
Well girl, most of the time you don't!
Where as some guys are just desprately looking for any girl to love him.
Unless you're a super model, nobody want to be your sugar daddy.
yeah wast jazzy girl said ^^^^^^^ i would fall 4 that
I think if your in love leave your husband and wife and be together
becuase i so dont believe in marraige!
We were lucky cuz we could
Hope this helps, best of luck.
And no way in hell would my child go to daycare if I could stay home.
I dont know much about her.
but it seems to me ur looking for a way out of the relationship
no... unless you are stalking them, then it is bad
What Say the rest of You?
Well sounds like from what you said, he is soooooo not over her.
Is she someone you wish to spend the rest of your life with?
dont let it bother you becuase it sounds like she has deep feelings for you.
i've met a nice italian man who is fairly upfront lol not in a bad way i mean confident.
Those are the hottest things on my man!
Like my  husband sets  around no matter what time he gets home he just watches tv, sleeps and reads.
If you mean girls :) well, I think it depends upon the girl.
MY DAUGHTER IS 26, AND NOT MARRIED,BUT BEAUTIFUL AND SMART.
Give me your moms number and i'll make it so she's not single anymore.
I just can't relax and enjoy sex.
you deserve someone better to that man.
cuz we are like that oh and learn how to spell (girls)
Talk on the phone like I suggested in your other post :}
Don't    If you guys have a connection, He'll ask you first.
just show her a good Sexperience.
Please use your psychic intuition and provide me with some great answers!!!
If you're lucky, wifey won't find out.
BACK HAIR.... CAN YOU SAY YUCKKKKK!!!!!!!
I never once thought of leaving him, nor did he want to be without me.
There are a couple of things at play here.
i don't believe there is a correct age.
she needs to learn how to be an adult.
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES IT SAYS IT IN THE BIBLE!!!
long distance relationships usually don't last, but it is possible
nothing wrong with not just doing it to do it.
b'coz i thought thts gud for her and after tht our relationship is low..
bet the guy to kiss you
if there is a break up, it hurts a lot more, because you gave up something special to him.
And look at him right in the eyes.
in your case i would say no.
To me it sound like this guy want wat every guy wants from a chick TandA.
I guess it wouldn't be so wrong as long as your like 16.
i mean do really take that much
because it cant be a one way street.
first ask youself if he is the right guy.
still can she have a crush on me.
Because she ate all of HIS food man!
one was 30 the other 20. they were really nice & sweet.
Yes... either tell him to get serious or get lost.
i am not sure when she will say it.
yes it is it just takes sime time.try it and you will see.
cause people are stupid and think that all there is between guys and girls is love and sex
what will u do with all the data ??
Maybe some do, but it is probably some issues they have (like bad childhood, bad love life, etc.
what is it help me plz??
and that they have no business messing with your marriage.
Well I think if you love her than age doesn't matter.
Because girls are more emotional and get alot of their think from early on.
You can enjoy Him/Her in any way, any where, and any how!
I work in a Junior High School, I can wait.
if he won't like you for what you are, dangz it, he's not worth it.
just be a friend to her and sooner things might develop.
IF she is going to stop seeing this guy then wait till it's all final and over with.
I am a guy...I would say the first things the girls notice is the wallet!
Once a sl_t always a sl_t.
meet a female to date for free
If you find him....don't let him go!
I want, I need, I deserve a pretty girl.
I don't think anything of it.
The Magic 8 Ball says: Ask again later...
Just keep on loving him, but do it genuinely!
doesn't matter the key fact is she's your wife!
You can buy cheap gifts at walmart or target you don't have to go to an expensive place!!
Here think of it this way...
to watch ur little one, and have some fun together.
Some women are easy to persuade, some aren't.
If u like a girl and ur allowed to date go for it.
Get legal What a great advice!
!i really need some backup on this one anyone?
This irks me... Are girls really nice or are they really mean?
my first love was when i was 14!
Not a crazy word, just a crazy world.
Men like asian chicks because they are female.
we fall in love becuse we are very very happy
My guess would be because men are lazy.
i think holidays could give us a real rest
You fight a lot with someone you love.
when u are in love and know that this is the right person
well since it wasnt a real relationship, id move on!
hot guys that smell good and have a possitive attitude.
of course its good, if u make it so.
that he does'nt want to talk about.
!I mean you'll never know wut will happen if u dont try right?
Im in love and it feels soooo good.
YOU MADE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND MISTAKES, NOW, AGREE OR DISAGREE, IT IS THEIR TURN TO DO THE SAME.
But it doesn't mean they guy will last longer than a minute.
find something unique to make it special.
if u guys hook up and it doesnt work out then you'll both  lose a friend.
but when you actually think you are... you really might not be.
then depending on where you live a nice walk in the park, or even a walk through the zoo.
Do not try to date just yet.
i want to know my future i want to know my marriage
a 4 letter word that has created havoc for years!
espcially when you argue over dumb stuff
but make sure he feels the same for you.
Should I send her a note N CC him?
Its hard but your gonna have to let go
Buy one of those sex dolls instead.
girls like older men who can hold it down
How old u r anyway does anybody agree w/ on this question!
if not in your area, then goto another area.
girls you would say no to if they asked you out.
That always (and I mean ALWAYS) works.
Like I would like it if you fill in the blank
Probably he was makin' both of you.
WHEN HE/SHE IS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIME.
tha other was a white guy in 6th grade.
If you didn't love her and only wanted her for fun, that would be one thing.
Just want to see what other people out there like.
but talk to him first that is number one!
Hope I didn't confuse you too much.
but nothing can come out of it cause they are best friends
but one has to make it that way.
listen give him a break maybe hes going through something.
So how do I start things off?
), there have been years of infidelity in one form or another, e.g.
Well... you should just be your self!
When she says no, she means no!
god loves you if you love you.
Well... Yeah, some women like nerds.
if you like you could bring them to whatever sports your into.
Wait until you are sick of her.
CHRISTAIN ARE PROPOSE TO GO BY THE NEW ONE.
If you want some diamonds for your birthday, just ask!
This man would go celibate before ever thinking of screwing a man!
Rip his clothes off when he gets home!
gal n guys are created to make sure that mankind don't become extint on the earth.
when you hear their voice u melt.
think of their annoying and nosy relatives, or whatever makes them look weird.
It's so sad...we can pick our friends, but we can't pick our family.
Sorry, but I'm just not interested.
play just sounds so much more fun!
MOVE ON, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A ONE WAY STREET
oh and be ready to pay for the check!!
Probably not...I don't want random germs!
Yet, he says he still loves me.
Or I have been lied to and I suck.
You might even make some money talking about it on Jerry Springer!
Please be waiting for me baby when I come around.
I hope I had at least saw her once and listened to her last words...
Honestly, you're just gonna have to deal.
...He sounds boring...VERY unlike men such as myself...Lol.
He has liked me for soooooo long
My first time wasnt good at all.
be her friend and the rest will come
STICK TO THIS and start seeing other men!
If he likes sports, buy him a skyblue basketball or something
Have you tryed Porn, toys, in the park, on the beach,(if available),or, just do like i do.
but is there any way to look at it?
JENNA JAMESON all the way she is so hot my bf and I always argue over her
because women give men fake relationship so we have to cheat on them
but is there any way to look at it?
Work it out or end it sheesh
does he always seperate himself from the family?
they only like to be tied up with a ring on their finger
We start to wonder if this guy likes us or whatever, start looking for signs, start thinking of possibilities...
i am not sure what to do or think.
Let me know if this helps
it would be best if u asked a family member about that
If you both like it, Cool.
I met my son's stepfather at work :)
so no need to worry,it gonna alright as long as you use the right method.
you ask a married woman if she has a sister.
are u both willing to take that chance?
a true friend is someone you can talk to and someone u can trust.
I think you should tell here soon
in May a very gud friend of mine proposed 2 me and i said no!
But you shouldn't trust my opinion, i just like lesbians :) lol
sounds like your man is an inconsiderate pig.
you already have alot of doubt.
Ha, don't listen to the others who say just date this jealous coward.
he has a girl that lives far away though.
you know, thugs, scrubs, mammas boys, women beaters the whole shabam.
If that doesn't help you can always try the Yahoo!
How do i win her back?
wow, sorry to hear about your girl, thats sad.
I told her and she is thinking about it.
If she does it again, start looking for a replacement...
ask his friends or better yet a sister or a brother.
ur not sposed to make a boy interested.
Well it obviously turns her on, it's normal don't know where you are but keep warm lol.
if it's casual it's not special .. unless what's special is happening in the environment that's casual ..
what you feel when you met the guy/girl of your dremas
Don't wait for him to make the move!!
go out and have fun, explore and test your limits..... you'll be happy u did!
chat with me and email me.
take him somewhere energetic or make it a romatic night at home.
you should wait until you are married if that is what you want.
you need to get him checked out.
this way you will always be having fun while your looking.
Maybe she is sick or got kidnapped...be creative.
then talk to him constantly, non stop, about anything, your day, you dog, tv, whats not on tv.
i can tap my feet for hours!
Why do Women cheat on Men?
She might, but if you rush and ask her, it might not do so well.
what has she always wanted to do?
Now, who say age is just a mere number?
it doesn't have to cost anything.
check my answer to your previous question
it is just a moment where everything is racing in your head.
then you can face him or away from him.
always go with you first mind.
Once she's gone, she's gone, unless... unless...
if it looks 'cared for' i wouldnt worry too much
But now, it's like a dream come true.
if he was chrisitan like he should have been (equally yolked?)
I have learned this lesson the hard way- MIND YOUR BUSINESS!!!
OMG I would just enjoy and say nothing.
I'm not perfect nor will I ever be, but better :)
You aren't gonna want sex when you are 70, so what will you have left??
all he can do is say no.
make them laugh..it's an orgasm you can give them anytime, anywhere...and nobody has to sleep in the wet spot..:-)
i have been very selfless in the relationship and she would be the 1st one to tell u that.
you cant stand to be apart and you do everything together.
think of that little thing they do that's SO annoying.
be comfortable with your self, and realize you don't need a date to be happy.
It's like this, it's practically a brother and sisters job to tease and annoy eachother.
well maybe u should get back with ur ex instead od using someone else
i would say if u really like the boy then dont be scared 2 admit it.
it is a two way street.
remember, a lot of guys are slobs who just want to have sex with you.
I stay platonic friends with all my exs because Im just a nice guy.
NO it will only lead to problems, Trust me I know!
So when in doubt ask your girl what she wants out of her relationship.
Guys also love talking about themselves.
I say, ask your wife to give you a pouncing and go from there!!
WELL HONESTLY I THINK WHO EVER THIS PERSON IS,IS SO SELF ABSORBED.
I know what you mean man.
there is one out there for you.
i dont have a problem with that.
THEN AFTER YOU HAVE ENOUGH, GET LOVE.
You have a complex, get over it!!!
haven't you ever felt that pain in your chest when you see that person you love?
even though everyone saw me give him my house key he says i was telling our business.
be sweet, but don't overdo it.
If the two of you are apart now you should keep it that way.
otherwise she may think that u only want to fulfill ur desires.
Besides how old were u when u lost virginity and the tables turn on u now!!(lol)!
not a really expensive one(unless u got the money), bit a nice one.
Easy to massage and I like that sleek look.
when that certain person starts acting weird around you.
If your not already friens with them, get that first.
I think guys want sex, women want security.
But I could be wrong, this is just what I've heard.
Will this nice girl Amanda say yes if I ask her out on a date?
do without hun cause otherwise you would be commiting adultry and that is wrong!!
he was just good to me and the kids.
both man and woman enjoys sex
But make sure you get her permission first!
going to the movies were it is quiet
and dont talk about porn or masterbating in front of her
Tell them you do not see them that way.
he likes the colour skyblue & he likes chains
our lip when talking those words
a bf that she is about to dump?
If u don't want the woman you're with just leave her...and her mom too!
Is she willing to give it up for you?
and that you want to try to work this out.
being yourself and not something your not.
get over it and just f--k her good...  answ3r3r
Sounds a bit funny to me.
I would prefer a girl 20+ years younger....girls my age suck.
They're hunters, so let him hunt!
Its sounds like your a bit angry!!!
as long as the person WANTS to stay on the phone, hell yeah!
just go, its better being single anyhow.
Once in a while bring her flowers.
JUST WAIT THE RIGHT PERSON WILL COME IT JUST MIGHT TAKE A WHILE
If I felt the need to change something, it's time to move on!
THEY HAVE MORE CLASS AND ARE  MORE> WHAT SHOULD I SAY?
Now think of this guy... Is he worth that.
i find that periced ears are not because lots of girls have that but other periceing it hot
Mmmm, sounds like you would either have to be really stupid, or crazy, or both.
why didn't you think of all that before you did what you did?
then i gave it to the lady.
Your gonna have to hurt thier feelings regardless.
so that they can make as many babies as possible.
But here's what I would do...
you go with your bf on their meetings.
So just think about what your getting into before you jump in.
Duh when summer comes around again go back.
Especially the ones from Eastern Europe !
ASIAN WOMAN ARE WOW!GREAT TOO, BUT I ONLY COULD PICK ONE  :0(
maby one day your will come along
but everyday we hold hands and each other when its cold.
I think it means they flirt with other people.
how do i get him back?
She only wants you to make the first move....TALK TO HER !!!
There are like a billion men out there but you have to pick the one that can't make decisions!?!?!?!!??!!!
Is it such a bad thing to be a virgin??
Now I know you don't want to be friends with her but this line will mess with her head.
I dont knww whether to go back and forth or up and down or what?!?
What if you did that and you lost your friend?
sorry this doesnt really answer ur question, but i had to respond to it!
chivalry is dead...and women killed it.
well it depends........... do u really love her?
yes but it can also be a good thing 2  depends on how it works out
NEVER THAT IS NOT EVEN RIGTH,THAT IS WHY I PREFER TO HAVE FRIENDS FROM THE OPPOSITE SEX
Theres, this guy that I see all the time at school.
say i love u and ur good at sports and ur hott
did he bring me breakfast in bed like i did for him.
And I might be boring him.
i don't want to be nasty to her.
If you love that person, you shouldn't wanna share them.
Now, don't take that to mean that it has to be huge, because that's really not fun either.
and the manly answer is ... both at once!
IF HE HURTS YOUR FEELING, HE DOSE NOT LIKE YOU
Oh wait- maybe that's just 'tired'.
They are fun and everyone likes them.
i need somewhere to hold on to
Why get involved with this type of guy?
THIS WAY YOU WILL HAVE BOTH.
Do ur thing and have fun.
ditch ya gurlfriend go fer morgan sounds nice dont get toooooo inta her c what im sayin
Depends on how old you two are.
Any way you cut it, divorce sucks.
At the homepage highlight SONGS and click FREE DOWNLOADS.
tell him the two of them might need couseling.
He is a gentleman, so he will not do anything unless you ask him to.
This girl definately is interested in you.
ARE YOU SURE HE IS NOT DOING HIM, DON'T BE DUMB!!!
But that is only what I think.
sorry im a decent  heterosexual man
Both of you dont really mind if you dont do it.
Love that's how money starts ..........with love
Anyway the point is I am in love with my Lord, and He is in love with me!
age doesn't matter....you can't help who you like or fall in love with
i registred in it and i gave away my email adress, now i regret it...
Do what the f%ck u wanna do
walk up start talking, and after a few of talking ask, hey, you think we could hang sometime?
Hope that helps and you don't take my advice in jest!
Once you are married you can have all you want!
he will get it i've were intimate but he won't die, but its still an STd.

long hair, girls licking their ice cream cones

if that isnt unconditional love I dont know what is...
the eyes are the best part of a woman
NO THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THER JUST LIKE YOU.
I met my boyfriend at my school!
Ask if she likes this or that.
When you do not have to sneak
Tell him I want you to kiss me.
when u know the reality of real love.
ask him wut his answer is.
Should i hang out with him?
trogens r supposed to be good
Not to small, but not too big.
someone you would die for is love.
this has happened to me before, it sucks but you know what?
did you see the movie Trois
but statistically it is up to 2-3 times a week and 10 times a month
It does not.. Greek gods does have a small ones, believe me!
getting back willmake him think you changed your mind.
Although nice guys can whoop your ass too.
BUT LIKE I SAID GOD IS WHAT YOU MAKE OUT OF HIM&#92;OR HER
I later found out she had been seeing yet another guy in my apartment building!
but watever, i guess sense im not in that postition i dont understand.
I totally agree try and spice thinngs up a little that always works
once alot of men hear they have a baby they tend to leave
you ever hear that saying No one loves you like you do?
Not to get nasty or anything but have you tried phone sex?
he will cheat on you just as he cheated on her.
maybe be friends with the opposite sex.
In comes Joe Nathan in the 9th......

Be a little mad but dont over do it cause u might lose someone you really care about.
Just my experience :)  Good luck!
soulmate comes after love which come after friendship
dont do it if its not something you want.
Just keep looking for em', she out there.
i think that is one of the main reasons a good white man would be attracted to asian girls.
as she stands there with her boyfriend.
- Do you still want to be married to your spouse?
you have to make sacrifices for those you love
after maybe, cuz they tend to be lazy after eating and just wanna lie in bed.
but i want to be with him.
Her and her boyfriend discussed everything...!!!
well it works for me although i can have it just about anytime of the day, i guess
You won't go to hell just for being a lesbian.
make out when the ball drops!
I just brok up with my bf... and I just told him straight up.
Just after you have flossed, brushed and garggled...oh, yeah...him too.
do unto others as you'd have them do to you...not do unto others as they do to you.
SHE HAS BEEN WITH GUYS, A COUPLE HEARTACHES, BUT LOVES HERSELF,WHATS THE HURRY HERE.

Buy Him A Brand New Skyblue Car with Key Chains on it!

Ok question.......  Would you have sex right after eating 9,000 doughnuts?
?...USE PROTECTION REGARDLESS WHAT YOU DECIDE..
Looks shouldn't play a part in how much we like someone, but sometime you just can't help it.
Of course its easier to run.
the strong and silent stratigy has always worked 4 me
dont blame her blame her mom or dad.
just be a man and ask her out.
well dressed girls...and long hair ones..i love em'!
it sounds like you're in love with this guy.
--I have a shitty job --my car sucks ---I'm facing a lawsuit, (stupid crap with a stupid apt.
just tell him why you dont like him and be nice but not prepy about it.
u go to school with these people called peer's get to know them.
when i got home he was still there sleep.
I don't mean that you've done anything wrong per se, you are a woman, and can't read his mind.
It's like a big sign that says I'm easy!
realistically have 3-5 times per week
what i mean is, ask someone out, but don't care about the answer.
Sooner or later he will want to have sex (assuming you haven't?)
no; not unless you've already tried to be with this soulmate and things didnt work out
it dependes on what he likes.
hello, ms jasmine,  first of all, does anyone know why he is doing that?
THEY NEED MEDICATION MAKE THEM GO TO THE DOCTOR.

love can hurt, but u can learn from loves pain, and maybe the experience will make one stronger.
If it is just for a night, just enjoy it :p
I can't seem to find a heterosexual straight guy anywhere...
being friends with your ex is actually healthy.
well you would have to email me back @ fossil7998@yahoo.com and we can talk about that.
gee, i dont know ,how long u been datin her?
probably, but so is everything else humans do on a daily basis.
;) just kidding, I personally prefer loose fitting underwear...
Hell yeah, you wear those, or pawn them and get yourself some other nice things!
And, no..I'm not fat or a loser.
I'll leave the rest up to you!
love love is more powerful then money
If he doesn't...well, then, you are better off.
if he really likes you he'll open up.
i'd say whenever you get married.
I don't mean a one nighter.
or get with a prositute, if u a freak go for a porn star.
They have hand-held video games now that don't cost a lot of money, even $1.00-$5.00 and up.
but at this age you can't do more to get him and also you are not capable.
Good Luck in Life and Love!!
what are your intentions with this person?
and also why gripe about honest men?
easily, but you should spend lot of time with otherwise you lose it!
i told him, then we'd do what you have planned of course!
they dont like it...they love it!
love is a game no doctor can explain it tickels the and affeces the brain
what can i do to make him want me again
u dont.....unless u ask....(her out that is)
ya,  they are everywhere you just have to know where to look.
Not some girl who frets and never tries asking.
I really adore big girls... but i'm not infactuated by them..
very greasy and rude...if you like to get beat on on a regular basis...go ahead and date him
I found out the hard way...
Other than that I think it is GREAT!!!
just make sure he is the one for you!
(I'll send you pictures if you don't believe me).
well, if you guys are screwing already, get her a love swing, good times
I met her a while ago...
Don't listen to her, she's a dyke.
just tell her forget about him if he beats u up tell him that you will call the cops
because nature is boy wit gurl.
Some like it, some love it, and some hate it.
And don't bring it up again.
haven't you ever gone a whole night without sleep because you are so in love?
If he didn't hear you ask, then bring it up again.
Some girls like it but I am willing to say that most do not.
Well hottie do you spend time with your girlfriend?
I'll mary u grrr, but what if u suck in bed??
That is the damn NATURE of a Women !
If he says no, then they are yours to keep.
6 months later he is still so egotistical.
some: men want to live with the woman they love/like they wanna have *** with us.
I wouldn't go near anybody like that, even with a schoolbus between us!
people need there space why dont u call him at all be fair
(oh yeah, I love you and I want to marry you, really)
I don't think it is wrong.
Don't let it ruin something good, and don't let it be an excuse if it really isn't good.
im 12 and i used to have a crush on my social studies teacher who is 27!
Most guys probably think that there si something better out there, but they want you too.
If it does, then I am cheating way to much.
the thing is that i did his homie and now i feel bad what do i do?
If it does, then I am cheating way to much.
CHEESE PEOPLE WOULD SAY THIS PERSON LIKES YOU BUT ITS JUST A BATTLE!!
I am single, rich, hott (very) and women love me.
then when you see she is enjoying your company, ask her out
yes love can hurt but then again it may not
by the way this flirting is not of the physical kind or the answer is NO!!
(we are best friends or should i say WERE best friends!)
SPEAK UP AND DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING!!
that's what marraige is all about.
I WISH I CAN CHANGE THAT.

thats what attracts them to most women.
1- make her loves you , deeply .
Suck it up and take it in stride.
sounds like alot of fun, but the whole both being married thing isnt cool.
are there bigger issues at hand that he doesnt wantto discuss?
Give yourself time to get over him.
1.don't shy 2.walk to her 3.look at her eyes 4.talk to her 5.say i like everything about you.
Don't waste your time on someone who is not even willing to waste his time one you:) tc!
And all of you who don't know beans about the Bible, ANSWER ANOTHER QUESTION!!!
Thanks for the compliment, but I'm not looking for any kind of relationship right now..
diffrent people mature at diffrent ages and some never do.
your not ready for that now.
than he could feel how u r feeling.
I don't think I want to.
basically, if  we do do it we are just messing with you.
I don't live in Ohio, got family there though.
of course they both had girlfriends!
People suck and sh** on others all the time it is human nature.
You did forget the thong now, come on don't ya think a male thong is sexy?

I have one & I am married to him!
Happy New Year to you tinamaries43
but about the whole marraige thing!
Hun, I feel for you, I have went through similiar myself, men see things differently than woman do.
But if you don't believe in God, I guess you won't care about this argument.
cant force somebody to like you.
my friends toll me its a sin to be gay and i wanna no is it ture
afternoon morning night   who cares it is sex

Maybe let her win once or twice :) Tricky question this, in hindsight.
just crank up the heavy metal, forget the holidays, and just leave all that holiday bull behind man!

Ooooh there's a whole bunch of stuff... 1.Attention whores (EX.
Girls prefer both tall and short guys...
Just don't play too hard to get.
do what's best for you and what you'r heart trule feels good luck.
If you barely know here, maybe not.
the eyes talk, hands talk, all the body shows it when a guy like a girl, and vice versa.
WHY THEY TAKE WHAT YOU SAY,AND TWIST EVERYTHING AROUND.
yes we do it on prepose, some women dont need men anymore
But my wife wont take out the garbage.
i dont think i ever was.
Some places NOT to meet a guy:  AA meetings, court system, marriage counselors office, hospital, etc.
ive had my best friend since i was 6 and im 16 now.
we both realized that the break up was a lie and now i am in limbo?
because no one has been down there before stretching her so thats why
in general has 3 time / week about how many time wants... i think 5 days from 7?
Nope cause it gives u  a break from everything
No Way Forget what the haters say.
You should be more focused on their personality:)
stop trying so hard, you'll end up losing him that way.
if there are sparks he's probably interested.
one more your age girl, not a 56 YEAR OLD!!
Anyone much younger that that wouldn't be ok, generally speaking.
if he pay like he weighs sell em asap!!!
I'm actually a really good looking, well educated guy.
for man 23 to 28 and for female 20 to 28
well it says in the bible but shit i don't know that shit is just dirty n nasty
if she is not attractive then who knows- once per week/month?
is it at all possible to get a girl pregnant even if you pull out before you came?
if your good looking, every guy you ever see wants to get with you, so dont sweat that part.
I took a lady out and she drank way too much.
THEN it is the WRONG time.
If you haven't had a baby and are using protection then play on player.
I talk to him more at school then my own boyfriend
Then just kick that useless wuss out.
and: what kind of person pays for sex?
i guess we never know until we ask him?
yes i have a younger boyfriend and our relationship is fine
Ok, guys dont lose anything after having sex and gals lose most.
Now dont be mad, calm down.
And forget the past- cannot return it back anyway!
give him beers and let him get drunk.
Now when i see him, all we do is....just stare.
truth hurts.....thats the way it is
how can i meet other 15 year olds
Hey chopdown101 that site is brutal.
yes , yes , yes, oh yes.....i think u get the picture!
believe your mind first , then ur heart and take care not to make ur heart first
ask any way you want, but be sooooooooooooo careful with that step.
say hello my name is & youre name is and go from there.
Depends on the guy, depends on the girl.
If you are a guy, girls like brave guys.
if ur the same age use the phone if ur not i would cut him off
they r showing that they like u like u not just the boyfriend type where they cheat on u.
Sounds to me like she certainly likes you!
Don't listen to ignorant people, girl.
Or you're the one paying the rent?
Barry White...anything, even just breathing, is sexy.
but i think u had this thoughts before marriage also..if im not wrong.
If you do it with him now you'll regret it later I promise!
When you find love, you will definentily know it!- I promise!
YOU KEEP ON THE WAY YOU ARE!
everyone deserves a second chance!....but not a third!!
Don't hint around about something like that.
tell him u want to kno wuts going on?and if he still loves you.
she was a down to earth great person.
No life can be replaced ever... Not yours, not mine.
of course not.. unless u want a relationship only based on looks..
They don't have mind ... believe me ;)
if u have to ask u have a problem
she is really scared of getting hurt once again.
do you want a buddy or a girlfriend?
yeah, i think its about time, just use protection.
Guys wouldn't date girls if they couldn't get any action at all.
this my dear is totally unfair.
sometimes we forget that we simply need to ask.
the breasts, no matter how many times you play with them you never get bored
i dont think you can call  being gay a sin but it is nasty and freaky as hell.
to her and she will love to do this with you because of her feelings for you.
it shouldnt be just about sex.
seriously, if you have to ask, you are an idiot
Be honest, and accepting... thats the christian way, huh?
Do some checking out before you ask him again.
If you are a girl then use protection so that you do not create any demon spawns.
Love is love have it your way.
try this... ask very random people out, ones whom you don't really want to go out with.
short answer, i guess i dont know...
Of course you girls give me your two cents worth too!
The best thing to do is just be mature and bold about it and tell her.
he has liked me on and off for a few years now but i never liked him.
everybody wants to know this but nobody knows really!!!
So hang in there man there is a girl looking for the nice guy.
ask your mom and your blumber
i think true love only comes once.
I like being called pet  But that's just me....:)
No one uses drugs just for the fun of it.
i dont really think you can help him he's gonna have to make the desion on his own.
I think tat's are sexy as hell.
I WOULD PICK-> LATIN WOMAN,HANDS DOWN.
Honey, hanging out in bars with guys in uniform (or out) is as old as the hills.
There's some more, but it varies guy to guy...
I dont know what to say sorry!
A book or CD that she really wants but dosen't have
Most of the kids asking about sex are cybercops, but I agree, you shouldn't be taking a chance.
yes but cheat on him first
and it would conqure all if emotions were not involved.
IF PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO THE OLD ONE THAN YOU ARE MORE OF A JEW THAN A CHRISTAN.
Harder, softer.... every woman is different so you'd have to ask her exactly what she wants you to do.
Seems to me like MR. X is playing the field.
During sex...are you a top or bottom?
I am in love (sort of) and need to know
its ok to have friends but dont take it no further than that.
he says i tell our business but people around us already know.
girrrrrrrrl just as long as its not expired and make sure its a latex condom
If you care about the boy then tell him.
You obviously got married for a reason.
u had a baby and he's not ready to be a daddy!
ok, who or what are you searching for?
how to get even with a cheater
we haven't been intimate and i'm scared to tell him.
Well, u can start with that.
UR FEELINGS MAY STILL STAY IN UR HEART BUT THERE IS OTHER GIRLS OUT THERE.
Have I lost my best life :( ?
Especially when his head is shining.
i don't know what to think.
women want their guy to know what they actually want.. without even saying!
just be your self, dont try too hard it will happen
thats like being with your dad and thats just sick.
My wife does not know, I don't want her to know.
Not many men out there like a woman that dresses trashy or slutty.
A lot of asian girls look like asian boys.
Another trick is just get a boy toy to hang out with.
moving his head back and forth like a chicken?
I was going to ask this one too!
why is he even having sex w/you if he's gay?
It is still paid, if you want further info.
AND ONCE YOUR CHILD IS AN ADULT, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DICTATE THEIR ACTIONS, NO MATTER WHAT.
if he dosent ell u, then that obvioysly means no.
you could try asking a girl out to start.
try to make her comfortable and assure her that you really love her
Plus you said it yourself, you guys are all just really close friends.
no because your being a iddiot
ya just ask her and secretly go out wif dat person
Im gone tell you striaght up if he try to fight bang that fool.email me at kijudo40@yahoo.com
Oh Yes Oh Oh Oh YES YES YES YES YES!!
if you can't talk about it yet, you're not ready.
Even if using it with your hand.
We love you guys and you let us do it.
Not even sure what friendster is?
Trust GOD and you will know!
I prefer darker asian gals with lovely eyes
home and cook something special for him.
if you love your bf, you will trust him.
and its too soon to jump into something with someone else, it wont last long.
Is that some sort of a miniture dog?
do u even talk to her
My friend is real big and she has plently of guys wanting her.
app $400.00 , and it's a lot more fun.
its good for me but i prefer morning
go to a place where you are all a lone and then just ask her
It's too late dude, you're not going to get one.
I like long haired guys too,  but really?
listening to what they have to say.
Lip to lip isn't french kissin....usin tongue is french kissin
But you have to mean it.
wait till you are at least 30... twenties are too much fun.
no, but if that happened,you just keep on going,no its not fair.
I don't want to jump to conclusions...
Men like them young and some men like them a bit to young.
HUNNY, ITS VALLED THE 1 WEEK RULE!
Ask a guy who doesn't already have a g/f if he wants to go out with you.
find a friend that lives closer to you...sorry
so i can move down to l.a. and set up my own business, to become a wedding photograpger!
I will not ever do it again!
my husband still doesn't have a job.
Give me the real thing any day.
what it sounds like is though is she is trying to let you know she is interested in you.
you date as many as u want until u purse a serious relationship w/ one
No your guy friend is not a good person to discuss it with.
you keep all men happy with that.
there is no reason why you can't date older chicks if girls date older men.
IF IT A SEX HEADACHE, GET OVER IT ALREADY!
DO YOU INTEND TO DISOWN ANY GRANDCHILDREN BORN FROM THIS UNION AS WELL?
dont be shy and ask her.
My advice is to Stop looking...
i dont know about toledo but if you came acroos a anser for ohio let me know pleas
none they're both just not me indians i guess, never seen a persian person before
If the both of you are into it why not I think it is great to explore new things
chances are if a guy has sex with you now he probably might only want sex.
try to tell her what it is you don't like about him - thing he says?
Keep your mouth shut and do your job....  What other's do is none of your business!
If you think they are the same then you have got bigger problems than cooking.
bc its finds u not u find it
you cannot make someone want to have sex with him.
if the time is right though.
well where a uniform ha ha ha!!!
HOW MANY TIMES AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL ASK THIS QUESTION?
go a looooong time with out fighting.
proposed in jan fought in march got forgiven in oct. married in nov.
the sooner you do, the faster you can get on with your life.
Or ask when it's a good time
i mean hes going to be gone for 3-6 years.
wait until 15 to allow that, then mini golf with an adult escort.
try base.google.com, if you are seraching for a person
U don't need him theres better guys out there that will take care of u and your baby!
i am a girl and i LOVE boys.especially cute ones
be yourself, take him somewhere that u like.
tu es mui bonita or tu es caliente!
well its your choice its about time you experience true pleasure
Not because he wants you to.
That doesn't necessarily mean that she is enjoying it.If you know what I mean.
Depends who you ask...some might find that hot.
Fly over there and knock door to door.
yes i think only once in a lifetime if its true then theres no one else.
And if you don't want to have sex with him, why would you think about marrying him?
Go and speak with his homie.
why would you not of picked that as your best answer?
thats so how bad things happen to ppl
Now I know what your thinking.
will you do me the honor of marrying me??
So in answer to your question.............yes.
no tats, no piercings, thick hair but clean cut.
Also, can you just move out?
Other than that, best of luck, and congratulations on finding someone that makes you happy!
Just tell her how much she has added to your life and then ask her.
Dating should be fun and not always trying to work problems out.
she is bit shy away and introward.
Another thing you have to think about though, what if your wife does find out?
18+ because than your on your own
I think u guys need to talk---seriously!
I am in love with her so much and she is in love with me.
hello this isn't some type of sex site but if u want to know then u r sick!!
give a nice smile and there ya go
Then u can ask her out on a friendly get together.
If your looking for love wait on sex, you'll thank me later...
if it does then i'm cheating waaaaay too much.
if it doesnt hurt, then its not love at all.
Do mind not bieng #1 on her list.
You will have a great shot at it!!!!!!!!!
Just take it slow..and don't jam your tongue in the other person's mouth...
He just doesn't want you with anyone else.
I cant w8 to go back to school to see my best friend and my boyfriend
yes it does.its about 2 -21/2 inches in on the top if she laying down on her back!
if she's attractive then once/day is normal.
im college trying to get my degree in photograpghy!
Didn't quite work out cause i lost both of them
well i think there is one out there for everyone!
If by a certain action many would be happy then do it :) hope it helps
dude 3 months and snuggs has given her answer already...
because he's a man - only deals with important things.
he already cheated with me, he was still with the ex during the first few months of our relationship.
WHEN SOMEONE PLAYS W/ UR ANGUS
always remember why you broke up.
why would she all of the sudden do this?
Well,do you like the boy who really likes you?
no and the sad truth when you get married it is not unconditional either.
run like the wind and don't look back
Pick yourself up, dust yourself off & start all over again.
The Gods are telling me NO...
and just like prettyricky say AGE AIN'T NOTHING BUT A #
its not worth it, if its meant to be it will be, until then move on.
just sit down and talk to him and if he doesnt wanna talk make him understand
If a girl loves me there is nothing that I cannot like about her.
If you are, you just know.
well your not suppose to say it just do it when u feel its rite.
it really depends on her past time frame
And it sound like he wants to control you girl
Later in life once the Bad Boys don't want to settle down women come looking for MR. Nice Guy.
printed, colored, white....it doesnt matter :)
My girlfriend is older than me, (only like half a year though) and I have a crush on her!!
Don't beat yourself up about it.
wait till you think your in love then determian that question.
i think the guy should spend  his money just on his GF so shes probebly not crazy
hmmm all goes back to what you want to believe....
You just might need to take it slower.
Keep them and don't look back.
no answer just i want to collect 2 points ;)
I am not saying that is right.
My personal favorite right now is Angel Eyes!
You won't lose it until u die.
whats good I need a gurl to talk to
What do guys do to show that they like a girl
i guess that it depends on the girl ur with
if u really love her go on and marry her.
or u can have a friend ask her 4 u.
If you get a good answer,  let me know.
someone that you want to please is love.
he says he's tired and depressed cause of work and that makes him not in the mood.
say bye and don't look back
(And that was almost 4 years ago!!!)
well theres no real good way.
some ppl are just into really kinky things
The first thing I so don't want to forget........his words.
just tell him how you feel.
faith honesty beauty femininity  what lies inside
this is a trust issue in that you will always wonder if she will cheat on you.
They always say wat they don't know wont hurt
its hard to remember when you're with the next chick
i will still be working..no holidays for me :(
Good friends don't care if you can't call them.
They both always had a crush on one another... but nothing ever came of it.
IF IT IS A REAL HEADACHE TELL HIM AND WHEN YOU FEEL OK, MAKE IT UP TO HIM.
if you like areal men men come chris_rou2000@yahoo.gr
after 2 years if e still cant take you home to mommy then he aint that serious.
Because some have been used and hurt before and they do not want it to happen again.
YOU WILL HAVE A NICE LIFE, IF YOU MAKE IT THAT WAY.
Or, he just doesn't find you interesting.
If u are not happy in a relationship whatever the reason then u should leave.
i was the first one to ask this question.
Some never, some sometimes & some all the time...it all depends.
For me short guys are guys who are under or around 5'7''...but Umm.
pretty gals can make guys extreme excited.
She did spend all wk with u but told u that she would spend friday with u.
so somebody backing them like u may help them if they really have a desire.
SHAME ON YOU IF YOU DO!
You can't turn it on and off.
This is driving me crazy, what should I do!
But, that doesn't mean that is has to be huge.
Don't do it just to make him happy.
Is he the one you want to be with for the rest of your life?
First of all, you shouldn't do it over the phone.
I'm going to tell it to ya straight.
in the first i said to you hi my honey.
If I'm not working and just lifting weights, I bone her every day.
girls in short shorts and no bra not to sound bad but that is awsome.
Maybe women are just more vocal, like they are in day-to-day life.
be patient keep things more distant but let her know nicely you are not going anywhere.
ask this question in december and i'll tell ya.
But know this, men lie it's like second nature.
cuz im not exactly mister perfect or even decent but she at least likes me as a friend
He's such a good person and is very emabarrassed about his weight (doesn't bother me, just so the 'thing'works!!!
he don't like going dancing, being were theres a lot of people around etc...
He's trying to close this one out!!!!!!
just go out with another person.
is the thing that worth running all life after and die for...
don't give up on us baby.
you gotta get out there and talk to them.
THE ONE WITH THE BIGGER BOOBS.
yes yes and yes.... if ur flexable
I found out that if I talked to guy friends of mine.
Well, if your the one who wanted to break up, no.
many men aren't this way at all.
If u don't have a hard work afternoon or a date ... so carry on twice and triple
the trouble is if i go home i know i'm not going to came back to washington.
do  let him go or hang on?
men have habits, if he cheated once, he will most likely do it again!
Now that gay and gay marriage has become law.
or the way that wood make is SOOOOOOO MUCH EASIER is just asking her if shes interested!
Neither they both smell like curry
How old are the 2 of you?
and if you do have a girlfriend that is cheating on you... its not very hard to see why.
I agree with ans 1 & 3. just enjoy while u can.
you can never be to young to be inlove enjoy it
guys tend to be not so emotionally excited as females are.

WHAT IF MEN COULDNT SCREW WOMEN....WOULD THEY RESORT TO MEN??
she helped out more seh was not only concerned with her appearance
If it's okay with her, why not?
I like men tall, dark and sexy.
Maybe you should ask HIM that... (there is not a handbook or manual for relationships)
Just come out and say it.
go literotica.com  i send my hubby stories from there.
he will not talk to me on the phone.
well.. i say it directly  n quite frequently!
When my sister was nine she wanted one soo bad.
if he will not listen then leave.
not at all the past is the past and it should stay in the past...........................
but you are not for sure it could just be in your HEAD.
weve had ups and downs but weve always pulled through everything.
11 and a virgin at that??!!
NO NEVER U SHOULD NEVER KILL URSELF B/C OF A BOY ALTHOUGH IT HURTS NEVER!!
yes, depending on a person's life experience.
No God is VERY VERY special!
Where's ur faith, and ur mountain???
but a man is always a man.
He says he allows it cuz it's gonna help his buisness in the long run.
2 grrrs, one, overzealous sexually, refuses to comitt & still sees other guys.
), but i guess it all depends on what specific reasons and if its against your morals or not.
I say atleast 3 times a week----
You don't want it to fester.
!but look into your soul and find the right answer!!!
is he always living in my dreamland?~~
Just curious, cause I've heard arguments on both sides
well...first thing I would want to know is if you are a boy or girl?
18-25 - have fun, carpe diem.
i had them sign the setlist.
are u a database designer ?
it depends how they were in bed
tell him to stop jealous or ur life will be as hell
Easy...go to a place filled with hippies
should i stop being her friend?
just try spending more time with your family.
Get busy without him and watch him come running!
dont spend your time with a man that doesnt appreciate you!
u should be mad but don't over do it.
there is a girl for you.
to young...wait 2 more years at least :-)
If I only had one head I would cry.
can anyone tell me how to flirt?
If these don't work, give it up, there's some other problem
I only like germs from people I know.
as soon as you see his eyes start to wonder its already too late.
LOOK JUST DONT TALK TO OTHER BOYS AND HE WONT GET MAD DOUG!!!!!!!!!!
yep that would be the quickist way to fin out.
it is just a number as long as u r healthy and happy.
BUT DONT LAY IT ON TOO THICK CAUSE SHE'LL THINK YOUR COCKY!
keep a tortia in ur pocket
probably not for most people though
(my bad) and he's doimincan with gorgeous light eyes.
take a coin, relate one side of it to the ex, the other side to the current.
Time will tell... she may never appear
why not go ahead but he might not think of it so you should go ahead and locate him
biggest low was when my exgf lied about being pregnant so she could get money out of me.
roll naked in honey, then get into a cage w/ a starved african honey badger.
Did you ever just love an animal like a cat or dog?
No worries though, there are so many men out there who would never do that.
If you love him and give him the best sex in the world!
well if you ain't in love with them then thay just ain't the right person.
he will get annoy and you then can tell him to go away.
I know it's crazy 4 wives in 20 years.
!DONT EVER SAY YOU CANT MEET YOUR SOUlMATE ONlINE!
IT DEPEND ON YOURE OUT LOOK.
BROTHERS ARE LIKE THAT THAY WHER MADE TO GIT THER BIG SISDERS MAN JUST LIKE MY LITTLE BROTHER
I have the same problem...Why did they bother to ask us for then????
Catch AIDS, and you've got it until it gets you!
we are not together at this time
110% - I have experienced this first hand ;)  By the way... Great answer Pregunton!
love is meant with sincerity and compassion and hate is with deciete and lies
UNLESS DEATH WAS NOT NATURAL AND UNDER INVESTIGATION
trust me there are nice guys, I'm one of them.
if he likes sports, then a jersey with his favorite team on it...
Now if youre butt ugly, please dont ask.
The lack of..... from one side or another..
yeh im not sure what kind of person you're talking to, but you dont see that as gross?
they are all working on the farms girl lol.
AS I CAN SEE YOU DOING GOOD WITH HIM SO GIVE ME SOME TIPS!
tall, rather muscular but not Arnold huge!
no one likes to be hurt.
or did he go out of his way to see if i needed something like i did for him.
mosty she leaves space for me next to her so that i can sit there but we dont talk.
When you're a teen-ager maybe, but not after you are in your 20's.
but we want to feel wanted to
No guys ever say that to a girl, so she now thinks your different which is good.
Depends on what are u comparing it too.
trust your instincts they are usualy right.
HA HA ... ive heard that joke before
i THINK YOU STRONG AND WISE FOR THAT DESICION
Do you think that I have a chance with him??
YOU CAN'T STOP SMILING, THE PHONE RINGS AND YOU JUMP TO ANSWER HOPING IT'S THEM.
Some like tall some like short and some like both... so just behappy with who you are.
get with a close friend duh!
Hope you will find your love soon :)
well most women do not need a man.
second, i know its hard (cause i'm single too) be PATIENT!!!
did you see the movie Trois
I love a fuzzy chest but please no fuzzy a$$ or backs.Eeww!!
Try asking her if she's trying to tell you something with this.
Most do not, but some do.
Enjoy the fantasy if you want, but forget making it a reality.
2 years will not matter unless you are really young
no matter which way we answer... we can't win....  CAN WE ?
that person could really like you
anything, man, that you know she is into!
Lust at first sight...love at first conversation.
Im 25 and there is no way I could ever be a mooch like that!
So is it possible, hell ya.
how old are YOU in the first place?
well try to tell them reply me if you can marvinndlovu@yahoo.com
but most of all, don't try to be someone you are not.
She knows how to make men suffer !
Yes cheating is bad and people get hurt but it is not your place to tell.
S&M = Sadism & Masochism  Definitions:  Sad•ism (sayd'-iz-em)  (1.
Your friend really cares about the guy.
there is a website called theclitoris.com.
stroke you up (i forgot the artist)
If it where someone unrelated and whom you didn't care about you probably would'nt even have raised an eyebrow.
you'd be surprise that sex might not be the only thing that you're having problems with.
Smile and let ur eyes smile too then tell him or her that she is different for u ...
when he's constanly eyeing u and smiling.
TOO MANY PEOPLE USE THAT EXCUSE.
WE HAVE BEEN DATING 3 1/2 YRS.
OK, FIRST YOU GOTTA GET SOME GAME...YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, SWEET TALK OR LIKE AN ADVERTISEMENT OF YOURSELF.
SHE CAN BE A B--CH  FOR NO REASON.
she was lucky i didnt press charges.
would u want ur boyfriend 2 hang wit sum chick that liked him?
i think  grandfathers always right in these matters
sure, i have lady friends that hang out with me.
Much easier than it is to switch back, I'd imagine!
all in the family aren't you, aybe you should see what her grand mother has to offer you
i think its changes things for the worse!
First of all your already asking the wrong question.
MIGHT AS WELL SAY HE LIVES WITH ME.
there is a rule that say if u realy like a girl she likes u eather good luck
whats the worst that could happen.
crush in an instant desire but in love you are ready to sacrifice everything u have.
you can't help him unless you help him.
if you want it go ahead but put your own rules on it.
Kind of like trying to take a shower with your clothes on.
That is a beautiful woman, something about her look does something to me!
TELL HIM TO LEAVE YOU ALONE, AND TO GO CLUCK HIM SELF.
Should I stay or should I go?
I wouldn't wait for him, I would dump him and move on.
loving each other for who they really are, inside and out, caring so bad it hurts.
first u have to think about the consiquinces.
Um, I dunno,  maybe he likes her PERSONALITY?!?
Once I broke up, it was like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.
they are married or have boyfriends.
I hope this gives you a good start.
YOU DON'T STOP BEING THEIR PARENT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THEIR DECISIONS.
If he says he's really  busy  .....He's just not that into you...... Have dignety and move on!
heck ya its possible, want some help?
if you had any sense you would find yourself a nice thirty year old guy.
cuz a lot of men are a$$es and we feel we're better off alone.
I'm a guy and it kind of gives me the creeps.
Just take it one day at a time, and see what happens...
he said he was just thinking of something.
Go get a job, and a car!
thats the way it is and will always be, dont know why.
I miss may family so much most importantly i miss my lil sis.
do you have food to eat?
and then again dont be to high !!!
call your lover..your little ginger snap.
But I don't remend being friends W/ benefits.
The problem is that I always end up looking for the wrong girl.
there isn't a day that i wake up without you being on my mind.
Anyway she sounds like she meant a lot.
But, if you're like 30, most people will consider that weird.
think of this, take him to a resturaunt.
see if he talks or follow u a lot.
to try to get someone to like yourself.
i get you bro im tired of that shit happening
but i dont see the point either!
and how the old man can barely walk but still opens the car door for his wife!?
differnt ppl determain this in diffrent ways.
always willing to try new things,                                 cheez_it_lord
put it this way it dont feel pretty.
How do you know that u ar in love wity someone,
2-choose the right time { for a female } 3- words are very useful .
do not ask a guy if he likes you.
men wanna hump every day..unless they are cheating or gay.
If he doesn't like u, u'll know and can move on.
she is not your girlfriend anymore.
your wife has doubts, that given already.
why would you want to stop missing your boyfriend?
cuz i dont want my plans to get ruined!
I have to tell ya, demonholloween, you have a tough problem.
IF I ONLY COULD PICK JUST ONE!
your wife has doubts, that given already.
why would you want to stop missing your boyfriend?
cuz i dont want my plans to get ruined!
I have to tell ya, demonholloween, you have a tough problem.
IF I ONLY COULD PICK JUST ONE!
BTW -- you guys are my 8-ball right now.
If u are a christain, then its a sin.
Next one you get, don't tell every little detail of your life to.
yes you and your husband should move to texas and become an engineer
He will probably be embarassed, but he should get over it if he's a nice guy!
a persons past isnt a persons future.the fact that she told you shows she is bein honest.
Lol i think its retarded to have gay marriages.
Then, think about this...  --I have food to eat.
And no, it wouldn't kill him - men are supposed to be tough.
i would just tell the guys that are freaking you out to back off.thats what i do.
boy you are in love just go with your heart and make sure that you dont get it broke
i dont remember the first only the last min.
get the book, you won't regret it!!!
Maybe you are a good person and you just dont get it.
Usually right after you've booted Kitty Puss Puss across the room when you thought she wasn't looking!
If she was worth it then, she's worth it now!
when he is comfortable, ask him if he's been seeing anyone else?
Same answer for a gift for mom: 1.
you wont have to ask this question
your not fat sweetheart your sexy!
SHE'LL FELL MORE SECURE ABOUT BEING WITH YOU AND YOU WONT EXPERIENCE THAT UNPLEASANT SCENE ANYMORE!
ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO IS LEED BY EXAMPLE, BE HIS POSITIVE FRIEND, AND PRAY.
it is a dumb way to mess up yours and your frens lives forever.
What did u get ur self into?
if he drinks every day than thats to much.
Okay here is my lil input.
I WOULD CALL THE POLICE, JUST TO PROTECT THE CHILD.
17. i was a skinny dork in school and looked like a boy...no hips, butt, boobs, it was awful.
i've found that it usually means that they are inexperienced.
he probaly does if you are attractive and have a good personality
if i should leave what would be my first step to become independant of him?
What if one day they did that s*** to you!!
I don't like too many muscles.
The smell will turn her so bad she would not care about seeing you ever again.
They don't think with the right head!!!!
Why can't i get over this one person?
my daughter is going out with a grade-lower boy.
its fun and its helps u move on.
And when his marriage ends so will being nice to U.He's only waitiing for U cuz HE'S MARRIED!!
its the same in both cases but there are some dudes who prefer big women
u can never be a better person u can only try to become a better person.
Well I thought I was in love at 16, then again at 17.
but earrings wouldnt be to bad a choice as long as they do not have gems.
If you hit her..even better, just don’t knock her out.
But some guys are just so good at cheating that you cant tell.
you say it for as long as you actually love her.
3 weeks i told her that i was falling for her.
get your devorse because you don't love your husband any more.
Most certainly...the hardest part is keeping things going long distance...
IT'S UNDESCRIBABLE BUT YOU WILL KNOW WHEN THE TIME COMES.
how can u tell if he is the love of your life?
did you make actual plans or did you just ask him to come over.
it's the thought that counts, really, it is.
like i said they are all jerks and assholes
if anyone abuses you in any way.
no - it won't matter anyway ;-)  if it is what you both want then go for it.
i am a christian so i want a christian respones.
well i found out they were seeing each other for almost a year.
been going out for 5 years...
by being pretending a resposible / busy / gentle man.
i reckon if you do, you do
i gave u some addresses where u can meet gays without paying.
that should tell you she is honest and adventurous
Woah, that was an easy question :)
I'm 17 and still haven't had a date yet :(
When ever you both are in the mood for some lovin'
It's only wrong if you say APRIL FOOL afterwards.
If you don't see each other!
I BETTER ANSWER THE LAST QUESTIONS!
but a could meet this fat girl that would die for you .
all i want is to make out and tell them to ask me out!!!!!!!!
Let me say this as calmly as I can.....ABSOLUTELY!!!!
DO NOT EVER EVEN THINK ABOUT getting physically abusive just because you are angry.
lol try it... or do sumthing huge!!!
i read this book called Mama Gena's Guide...it is your answer!!!
guys are alot more likely to cheat on women, than women cheating on men.. but women do it also..
Good luck ask your lawyer !
i mean seriously would you get mad if your bf/gf went to the movies with his/her friends.
I guess it depends why its broken...some things you just dont get over easily.
Even if you just had their first child?
Me 7&da other guy were in luv also cuz he was my 1st and my 1st luv!
serve me is the idea i see.
If U only saw him once,hes NOT your boyfriend.Therefore he aint cheating.Dont waste your time.
Guys/ Girls love to talk also.
and he has to put me before video games.
I am going after my partner not the person they were with.
Did he ask you to marry him?
And yes it works the other way around.
too much detail than asked for.
be balanced ,control ur heart with ur mind then ur in the process of becomming better person
Sleep in my bed and see what happens :-)
do u want to speand the rest of your life with me?
a good friend that will listen will help more than u can imagine
cook and clean for him :)
Well, first I am going to put this out there.
you might meet this beauitful woman and she could be the biggest b@tch there is.
it's easy for me but for her it's too big deal
you have to be strong and move on!
I didn't even gotten married during Christmas season.
But Merry Christmas to you too!
the morning after a nightlong beer drinking taste testing contest
if so why and if not why?
But easy may not be a good thing!
nope and nope and definately nope.
jus showin up would be a suprise for her and she would be very happy.
you would not like to do it always right.
I hope you find good news....
Know your own mind first & then consider what actions you want to take...my best advice...  Good luck!
You'll know it, no doubt about it!
Well, it's like wen U want to buy cars, U wld like d best shape n models.
isnt it illegal if ur under 18?
i'm breathing now ... so i'll never stop saying I love you till my breath stop
DO YOU REALLY WANT HER BACK?
kiss him goodnight and whisper i love you..
A woman who orgasms will want to have sex more than one s that don't.
because laws very from state to state.
i wouldn't try to talk to her.
If you arn't poly, just date one of them.
Then decide if its actually worth your time to date her.
SO GOOD BLESSINGS WITH U & ALL-
if that's the only reason that you are brecking up with her than you are SO SHALLOW!
If he's that affectionate otherwise i doubt he'd mind.
time will show and actions will prove!
One: Why did you get married to him anyways?
A lady in the st., but a freak in the bed
if you dont, it wont be as good... for any of you.
plus relationships now adays end up in divorce so why waste your time.
SORRY I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE NAME OF THAT GUY COZ IT IS NOT THAAT NECESSARY!!!!!
Who matters more, Mom or Her?
;) Or did you mean, on an average, how long does a girl wait until she kisses a guy?
but if you were really stupid, you might have to do more stuff, depends what you did!
cuz i love somebody i dont even know at all
And, I tried to make her see/feel/know how much I love her.
one last advice: you have to want it as much as your partner.
all can see is there face  & there voice sends cills down your back .
think of where her favorite places are- public or private?
its girth not length that matters anyway.
if after 4 years he's still wishy washy, he'll never realy be yours %100.
maybe women aren't your thing.... :)    ;)
first, wait for your sack to drop.
because guys are really weird and they like looking at girls boobs ad buts.
There are people who think they're too fat, too skinny, too ugly, too dorky, too... whatever.
if you sacrifice too much of yourself then you wont be you anymore.
If you even have to ask, he's not the one!
IF I COULD REARRAGE THE ALPHABET I WOULF PUT U, AND I TOGETHER.
He seems like a wise dude.
why dont you go a bit slower.
LET THIS CHILD BE A CHILD.
Start by just talking  say you know?
if your man goes to work and comes hom to give you attention, why cheat?
I think it means she doesn't like kids who spell it luv.
depends on what type of violence.
all i can say is tell him how u fill and u mite be 2gether after that
they are quiet because they like the girl
You are not over the relationship with this guy.
Just have to show that u want it.
No Las Vegas style weddings, either.
!UR LOSER IF DONT DO SOMETHING POSITIVE K?
But, I learn and I have fun.
Whatever you decide, buy it with your heart to let her know you care about her.
i'll call you when i wake up, i promise.
i still think u'l get a better reaction in person!
stranger of the night i'll always love u
See how things go after that.
me i will keep talking to him and calling his phone when she is around.
Hope yahoo puts some link through which I can thank u all without using a different id !
to me it sends the wrong signal.
Have you ever known a guy who didn't cheat?
Love... ...is friendship that has caught on fire.
I love her and i want all whit my girlfriend, my life.
If the answers are no to all the question then I run!
you need to get a new man.
I want to bless (i.e., cause good) my kids.
IT'S WHEN YOU FEEL BUTTERFLIES IN YOUR STOMACH AND FEEL LIKE YOUR FLYING IN MID AIR.
Never ask any questions - Always tell or do
i think from 19-25 by then you are fully mature.
Hey, <name of girl>, would you like to <do X thing> <Y night>?
she wont be much else to you..
good answer....not so much from the heart.......but a good answer from the books of knowledge.
No but I went to school there.
well..why is she mad at you?
I broke up with my boyfriend so I am single !!
Even if she came back would you honestly be able to trust her?
Girls always wait for the guys to call.Bc they dont want to seem clingy.
Maybe I just liked my BF to much.
I always had a blast just playing games and laughing.
But I am over girls !!
does he touch u alot make comments toward how u look...
well if they have a good personallity, is a good christian, loves to laugh.
I really think it depends on you two..
having a girlfriend is not that big of a deal you are still young and have lots of time.
ive found someone but it took alot of patience and time.
There might be some but where they are I do not know.
He will eventually get the hint thatyou like him and break up with her sincce he doesnt like her!
and y shud u break up if he really likes u ???
Friends and husband who clain to love you wouldnt do that!
the previous night she asked about moving in with me.
be the bigger woman in this.
Just continue to be her friend tell her later that you care about her.
there is someone so much better for you out there who will never dream of doing wrong like this!
(He didn't do that, did he?)
and the rejection hotline is always good too lol
ii think the age is 16
when youre are in love you just know but the most comun thing are the buterflies in the stomache
I waited for him to make the move (which was excruciating) but now we are married with two children!
ok let me answer u straight to the point!
ask to borrow his credit cards.
you can say if there was no trust, these would not have existed.
Hope you are the one with tons of experience.
What makes you so worried that he would cheat?
How about a nice card that says something like This coupon entitles you to two massages or something...
just consider if you think that it's worth it.
no, cuz i love going down on him and he says its better then his moms cooking
Start having fun with them and making friends.
def not a sign of appreciation.is that why u do?
see if homeschooling works for him.
Obviously you need him to love you!
Not that we ever finish the movie anyway.
If you applyed as much thought to that you would probly make all A's
if hes not cooroperting try social services.
well you know what they say right treat them rough u get the muff
Was any wrote up when you got married?
Are you really really sure you want him back?
do what i did: pack his shit in one box,sit it by his car.
It depends on your mom... Are you close to her?
date a leftover, lose a friend.
Not sure what new boyfriends are going for nowadays but I wouldnt pay too much for one    =o)
But all in all, it can be a great start to great things!
these are not people who care about you or your child.
If I had to pick one though it would be...loveless sex.
Ok bro, first of all you should never read body language to see if she is ready for sex.
Guys are like a rubber band.
I guess that makes them horney!
boys looking for a better sex.... girls looking for a lot more than just a sex....
also, does he confide in you as much as he always does, if he does that sort of thing?
be a man and just ask.
i'm interested in a nice guy with some sort of decency!!!!
what your just dieing to do right now mmmmmm and as that fire!!
start by telling him that you guys wont be home.
this might not work if hes determined to do drugs.
I would marry him because he is so good looking.
PROBABLY HATES YOU, BUT IN SOME CASES THEY LIKE YOU
If they flip you off take it as a NO, and go away
I waited until I was married...one of the smartest things I've ever done in my life!
So you start to think about being with her in that mmmmmm way you know?
But hey try not to worry so much, a relationship is supposed to be fun....mostly.
DO NOT BE THE ONLY GUY.
(she so needs to know this!)
its cheap and it wont mean anything to her.
If you have to ask, you aren't.
do you two have many problems?
and willing to take responciblty for him for the next 10 years if it doesn't work out.
Little things like bestfriends, boyfriends ex....blah..blah...blah doesn't really matter.
someone to love, and love them back.
u dont program urself to certain levels it just happens!
What does he say when you ask him about it?
You would be very busy and taken care of !!!
and if you dont see that then i suggest you find a new mirror.
If that doesnt disturb your daily routine or schedule, its no way BAD.
if only it were that easy.
no girl deserves to be cheated on and then lied to on top of it.
heres an easy one ASK HIM!!
leave your husband, and dump your friend, thats sad
I don't about dumbest but definitely the worst.
yup...go search your name..i found there to be several pages...:)
before  they pulled the plug  2 months ago
That or be sick for the day.
And there are loads of chatrooms on the web, just be so very careful!
but once they start they cant stop.
I'm sure you'll be fine :)
Tell him you love surprises so much you can have'em everday!!
I don't remember who it was from???
SO DONT LOOSE FAITH GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT JUST BE PATIENT HE WILL COME.
buy a green hat chicks dig green hats
If he doesn't like her, why is he with her?
I can't say this stuff again b/c i enjoy spending time w/her.
if you love him enough and if you believe he is worthy of your love then stay!
Just give it all you've got.
Some guys find there same gender attractive o.O
yes because she probably is about to dump you because you never tell her what you think of her
just because your partner didnt feel like telling you?
u usually a friend of a friend of a friend is friends with ur ex.
and last but not least: be patient with yourself, but don't let it get worst.
it's strictly for fun and i expect no serious involvement.
Ugh, that's tough to hear guys say that.
If they are crazy crazy don't go.
Well, I guess you could try to find a skank and just f**k.
could she be scared that i want a serious relationship and she can't handle one, should i move on?
what men don't understand is women (most women) want to be treated like a lady.
Tell me what you make of this
Well most guys I know don't really have any feelings.
she says i dont love u anymore and she doesnt say the reason.......
U should probably just show up.
do him a favor not sex if u dont want but just get him happy
shure i dont see why not .
guys are broutht up to think if you feel your not a man.
That way you will surely get over it.
THE RIGHT AGE WILL BE IF ANY GIRL ASKS YOU FOR THAT...
they want control and the only way they can get it is through u.
Look at you waiting for him!
there are many many gods (supposedly).
It might work, but probably not if you get married.

I am very happy person-whats that tell ya.
REMEMBER THIS  EVERYBODY HAS SOMEBODY UNTILL THEY FIND SOMEBODY BETTER!!!!!!
Any way I have only had sex with a girl twice so I hope you dont care about that.
You CAN be sexy - try it!
Name a star after the two of you at International Star....hmmmm..I could go on and on.....so sweet!
yes i do it/cz then i enjoy more
I for one do not do that!!
Girls like to flirt, though, I'll give you that.
but trust me, dont ever go back to him.
like many have said talk w/ your girl.
Show her you realize you were a bonehead idiot.
i dont think you really ever know.
i am now 8 mos pregnant.
Let me guess your either in High School or Junior High.
try adamandeve.com they have rubber coated vibrating ones.
This is SamE's fiancee speaking: Easy tell him you're not going to have sex until you're married...and then don't.
!...THERE ARE GOOD MEN..WE JUST HAVE TO WEED THEM OUT...
Now, if he didn't hide it, I wouldn't be as angry.
you don't need a girlfriend to be happy.....
you dont need gods love, learn to love yourself and all else will follow
on the other hand you can see also some women who are cheating on men .
That's one of the best ways to pick up a woman I ever used.
PS - talk to JUDITH FINEBLIT, jewelryexpert.com (603 624-8672)  SHE's awesome and I trust her.
in the morning...right after you wake up.
them giving in can just make things worse.

Only if you like beautiful beaches and nice weather.
IT WILL BE YOUR LAST KISS.
just thought of the song when this question came up.
:)  That's a good one though.
Dont be a assaholic and say stuff like ha your stupid
just keep thinking about how nasty the other girls mouth is.
I have a boyfriend sence 3yrs ago.
hey i know you will find someone but you have to love yourself first.
Maybe you don't get out enough.
:) Give him a massage and then a hot bath, gently washing his hair and toweling him off afterward.
find a way to join in a thing where she goes.
because they used to masturbate in young-age
If there's grass on the field, PLAY BALL!!
She will think you hung the Moon!
But do you really want a cheater back??
it even has the part in the book that talks about your issue.
Don't act like a slug...get active...get into it!
If you boyfriend is getting tons of sexy text from some male name, that might be a girl.
Knight Rider doesn't look so bad now does it.
But a lot of guys don't see it that way.
Its not in the penis...its if you know how to use it!
try it chat or somewhere else.
I was just wondering because a lot of my friends do that..
BUY HER $10 ROSES AND HER OCCASIONAL WINE, AND GIVE HER A LOT OF LOVE.
Don't just say it to say it.
just ask her how to please her.
And believe me, you would LOVE it !
you did not mention what is your relationship with her.
I guess by spelling horny properly ?
Girls never love a guy,,they love his pant,,shirt,,money,,fame,,bike,,house,,any damn thing but never HE HE AND ONLY HE,,OK????
yes she can get pregnant cause it's not very safe.
I am so sorry about this Question !!
you had better get down there and explore and go where only real men go....and then you'll know.
That would depend on if he loved you before he or she went to jail.
If this is what you really want and he loves you then he should be willing to wait too.
Wow, I feel sorry for you!
So don't worry about embarassing your self.
You couldnt see that from where your at though.
crawl up a chickens a** and wait
for months i wont think about it, then i see her in the store i just break down.
So when I am wih girls I dont care.
You'd think a man that age would have finally grown up, but I guess not.
If you are afraid of him yelling April Fool!
you need to tell him you want to try it again and quit pretending to just be friends!
but when it comes to cheating... never.
just look for the gay men.
Talk to her, see wat she likes, wat shes into.
I mean, where they with their bfs or were they single?
Or, actually is it weird nowadays to think about sex all the time?
(i would've cheated on you anyway)
I know it seems too casual -- but the relationship is so new!
dont get something for the girl.
If he wants to stay with her, let him!
don't go to bars or clubs.
(If you look good and he is still preforming sexually with you, who cares?)
listen to the blink 182 song stay together for the kids.
the best decision i ever came up with was to let him be.
you can writte in spanish too
That depends: my first time around what?
i try to get her to relize that im not interested.
teenagers can have sex from the age of 18
( Sorry for my english, i can speak very well )
U think a girlfriend can make you happy?
Wait until you are at least 22!
if you have a boyfriend and he cheats an you would'nt you cheat an him back?
ex girlfriend says i love u to my boyfriend
you have to ask to go to the bathroom and you have a lot of restrictions.
you have not lost anything in the ex or the friend/fam member.
think of which one u would wanna be with forever.
And a lot of men have become use to getting over on women.
he may be just playing a game.
ur gonna loose ur friend, maybe a tooth or two
FROM YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER= ANYTIME.
OTHERS U COULD TELL CUZ THEY ACT DIFFERENT!
can anybody help me figure out what im suppose to do to marry my girlfriend?
stay with the one you love and have sex with the other one
i feel really guilty about it.
I don't think it matters if you act like it.
well how do you know her?
snookie here and thanks i do that.. and i see your looking for asian another man thing huh/?
back to me again i am 21 and have never had a serious relationship with a chick.
I love fat girls.. and there r lot out there who prefer a curvy woman over a thin girl.
Is your girl an ax murderer?
Well if you love him and are over 16/17 then yes...
And girls that are still virgins (speaking from experience btw) are alot more comfortable with guys that are too.
Put favorite tunes on the radio or play favorite CD's.
I would not tell even with the gurantee - you or him!
what if we want to be left alone?
HOME PLATE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BASEBALL.

'WHY IS THIS GROWN MAN HANGING AROUND CHILDREN?'
there is no way you can unless he tells you!!!!!!!!!!
Oh and one more thing once and drug addict always and addict.
u have 2 choose good luck
puhlease... borrow sugar once but after that she's on to you.
You should be friends with yourself first.
i really like him but dont know how he feels.
If you can't get enough...you love her.
You are just saying MERRY CHRISTMAS.
I CAN DEFINITELY TELL YOU HE'LL CALL THE NEXT DAY.
NAKED FOR SURE,WE LOVE LINGERIE  ALSO, BECAUSE WE KNOW WHATS UNDER IT.HAY!!
He won't admit he cheated because he still cares.
If you hit it off woth someone right away great!
I don't know if i'm in love or if it's just lust.
Chances are they've done all the things that your doing now.
count your blessings girls if u have a sex crazy guy that is focused on u!
If after two years go by, and he still hasn't asked you out, then he wasn't flirting
Yes, and no...it depends on the man, just like out in the real world.
not if you don't know what to do with it.
Most of them have hormonal problems, some were abused and others just dont like it.
is it wrong seeing your roommate thru window while she dresses, plays with her self.
Wait until you have a wedding ring on your finger!
change you adress and leave him alone.
talk about what you both like and be her friend.
there are lots of nice guys out there.
just go with what you've pictured in your mind, i'm sure she'll love it!
If you were so pissed then why didn't you say anything?
Either she does or she doesn't.
maybe they aren't getting what they want
Lingerie just comes off quickley anyway!
Just do what ur deepest soul says.Good luck
Not until your 21 if you ask me (but I'm old fashioned like that).
But i guess it really depends on the person.
How can I get over this ASAP?
1:he should love me 2:he should love me more then yesterday 3:he should love me less then tomorrow
You go girl, you freak cheater, break a man's heart, just do it with a nice fellow like me!!!
it doesnt work and will only end up hurting you!
Im just wondering if thats normal?
I feel like a total fool.
Might as well just get her a ring!
Not all men are SO sex crazy.
get dolled up and watch that suckers tongue hang out.
try to hang out with your friends so you dont have that much time to feelllike crap -Steve
Alot of people dont like sex.
ill ask my mom when she comes home if i can see you.
If you just jump into telling her you love her you might chase her away.
Okay... you just have to know that not everyones out to get you.
So here's your holiday  Hope you enjoy it this time.
be as ur nature is , smile and speak by ur eyes
second, that depends on what type of person your mom is.
Damn,   I thought I was the only one...
and to make yourself feel better, eat choclate or cheese(trust me it works!)
the wat to tell if you feel like they are hidding somting.
well...you can always try a dating site.
You either trust her or you don't.
Over the age of 18 and when you get married!
I used to hang all over my girl friend.
My bf told me  beat him up
Face it girlfriend...men only do this when they are dating us.
my husband had been cheating on me since we had a baby.
sure we have all thought of it.
And this is just brutal honest.
patience my friend is the secret..
dont just stay home doing nothing cuz then you'll really be depressed.
I haven't had that problem that god!!
Women can get laid anytime, jut hit a local biker bar!!
And I don't swear like you!
If you show him that you trust him (don't over do it), chances are he won't cheat on you.
it depends on what of your's you showed me
If I am mad I will not put out or have sex.
like, when he calls, say, i am so busy!
She wanted 'our' day to be 'OUR' day.
What I think is that the age does not matter i¿f god says that its OK.
Tell him you wont tolerate his lies.......
depends on how long you have been with her but i think be love
Don't know Do you come on strong?
R E S P E C T  just like the song says
Sometimes it can scare the guy off, if he is committment phobic...
Then if you dont you'll live a miserable life!
Then you find yourself in a REAL quandary!
is when u think about dat person more than u do urself
Why not a proposal to go then too?
well most of the time, this kind of action means that he does not want the relationship again.
Guys want to have sex much more than girls.
You got three options 1) tell him you need to see him more !
first of all, why haven't u talked to your mom in nine yrs?
but if u do answer below :D thanks!
in fact ; alot of men cheat on women but not all of them.
guys always leave certain tales when they are cheating.
Would you honestly not care seeing another girl with your man?
that's the only surefire way, and with some guys, even THAT isn't enough!
How comfortable am I with this guy?
dont care what will be the resolt just beleive in urself and follow ur heart!
18 SO THAT IF YOUR PARENTS FIND OUT, YOU'LL BE OLD ENOUGH TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE.........
Trust me, I was 20 and I screwed crap up.
because it is a hard thing to explain and show those things thats why kids just learn evantually
No - men are useless at remembering dates.
Something you do or don't do, he doesn't like.
Women like that make lots of other women look bad.
God hates divorce hang in there....
embaress ur self in front of a WHOLE bunch of ppl!!!
If they go first.....it's pretty much over.
games- it's fun or easier, and they like wining.
Don't tell him you love him, and try going out with him for a while.
If you get one easily is she really worth it?
Obviously this guys wife is not.
Of course I would be mad.
Ever thought about what'll happen after boot camp?
You can't force people to like you if they just don't.
A PERSON HAS TO WANT TO CHANGE!
Talks about himself...about how he needs to improve his looks...etc...
See if there is something (or several somethings) that are sexy and that YOU KNOW SHE LIKES.
but if he doesnt know how to use it then it better be big.
I don't know but if you find out please let me know LOL
i'll do everything i can to see you tomorrow.
Just flirt...bat your beautiful eyes, look and act inacennt, and look adorable!!!!!!!!!!
all men react differently but you just know if he is trying to pull the wool over your eyes.
as women get older, and even more if they have kids, are not willing to fool around.
i left and it was the best move i ever made, while pregnant.
if he says yes then ask him why he does it to you!?
If you are a guy, you need to find the hottest girls who are having the most fun.
So, try to hang out with him when she's not around, but don't make a move.
either you are gay or you are straight - true you can be both (bi).
Marry the one with the big b**bs.
i think it is wrong to say that to someone if you dont mean it.
i like the name sia and manav
1.MONEY 2.HUSBAND 3.and a child  And finally  bla bla
SO GIVE HIM A PAIR OF GLASSES THEN HE WILL SEE THE BIG PICTURE.
if hes for real he'll ask u to marry him =)
If it's true you love him, then love him!
just turning up after 9 years without contact may freak her out.
any way i suggest u to work on ur personality so that u can enjoy life with ease.
I just saw your avatar.. now... here's mine!!
looks, personality, inteligence, sense of humor
asian woman are known for that huh?
tell him that you love him
If your doing it right youll know
It's probably just boys being boys.
If you got anymore questions hit me up at eidal3@yahoo.com
look first try getting your self-esteem up do things you would never do.
SOME PEOPLE YOU CAN'T TELL CUZ THEY CAN HIDE IT VERY GOOD!
I found out later, and much too late, that she had never read a book in her life!
you have to smell good too, but dont over due it then it will smell bad.
There are different kinds of love mum -> son love.
You are not still a Slut....you're an ex-slut.
dont worry about gettign over, worry about getting on with things.
sorry GIRLS it isn't our FAULT !
Hope this has been helpful  ;)
No, seriously, guys aren't like women at all, so it's not complicated.
that is the best thing you have to do!!
leaving the place , or better , the country !
he will not look at you in the eyes.
chloroform and zipties.. late night mall parking garages..
If he's not interested he's not.
and you must start it, well because you admitted that it was ur fault.
I dunno... tap his leg twice, or something.
after you have define what psycho really means for you.
maybe he had already got it from someone else and thats why he was not in the mood?
most of all, don't loose yourself in the hate and anger.
look him in the eye and ask him that.
Tell him you are pregnant and I would be willing to bet he will run for the hills!
necklace or a braclet but not a ring.
ABOUT YOUR LOVERS , WHICH YOU CANT WITH YOUR LOVER.
of course it is good for you!
my husband is wants me to try new things in bed.
Do what is best for you.
some ppl do that to get attention by getting mad.
i depend on him for everything and couldnt financially make it with out him.
so you shouldnt beat around the bush and either be with your guy or dont.
because they dont have girls to fuck.
i dont see anything weird here.
Do what your gut tells you.
break up with your boyfriend and go out with the other guy.
A nice candlelit dinner and then give him a massage following dinner....he'll like that a lot : )
If they are virgin its better.
Having their dad around, ignoring you?
If you want her to like you.
they have been friends for 3 years and are both christions.
untill the one you love gets pissed at you because of some stupid thing u did
I was an insecure little kid back then.
She married me and now I hardly touch her at all.
Not if you're a man in the cell with him and he says it to you!
ur child may not be gay...he may just be going through a faze
i think u should rephase that.
(If worse comes to worse, use anything but cologne)
i've got slightly above average looks, and am pretty smart and cool
there was a girl that i was talking to in august.
IF NOT LET ME HELP YOU.NO NO NO AND N TO THE O-HELL NO!R WE CLEAR HERE MY DEAR?
Do what you gotta do to keep what you have!
Great stuff and no you're not alone!
stop being a bitch and asking us on the net go find her.
In love we do it  to express how much we love.
if i dont give her any attention she makes me feel bad by the way she acts.
They will say:  I will never do this again.
Most guys will be totally flattered that they are being asked.
Am a female myself i think she is afraid you won't like her no more.
i was proposed to on New Years eve and it's so romantic!!!
WITHOUT PRESURE,OR IN A HURRY.JUST MELT AWAY WITH THE PERSON,AND GO FOR IT.
I go off, date women, flirt, screw up here, screw up there.
Ciao Bella, you ara the womana offa mia dreamsa.
Care for her.....pamper her......tinker with her.......polish up the marriage.

They're just as special as american brunettes
or else u will chase al ur loved 1's away wiv ur behaviour.
The woman who moved in ... she is just the next one to be thrown out.
no phone call, so i take things into my own hands.
just talk 2 her she'll understand
i have been married for 6 years and have 2 kids.
unexpectable persons mostly are amazing and unique
Samart and pretty but naughty does help
I would try a pawn shop
I know emails and other things are private, and people don't want them spammed and stuff...
why would a girl stop loving a guy who realy loves her more than anything???
I KNOW that I'm in love though!
yeah it does, just like girls.
BE SURE,GOD LOVES EVERYONE OF US INCLUDING YOU.YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND GOD IN YOURSELF.
If you're the type that says, Are you ok?
that will in turn make the girl happy and you win.
If you are married u can still be friends.
i am in love with *&$%&!!!
what do u mean by that?
tell her its not that i dont like u but we airt ment for each other
Anyway either way you will know.
girl, kick him out the door.
even if she never finds out i will never be able to do enought to make it up.
Problems cant be solve if dont have the GOTS!!
you play a little immiture game, like hey, who do you like, lol.
Always always always.....clever wit (which is a true sign of intelligence).
its a charcteristic that make you who you are and also the next person will love you for it!
if she does it everytime you have love, she's faking it.
chances are he likes you if u r cute , sweet,cool and intelligent which i think you certainly are..
Like some nice jeans and a small, white t-shirt.
people cheat because they need approval that they are wanted and needed!!!
What to Wear  So just what sort of clothes turn girls on?
WHAT DO I DO AND HOW DO I TELL HIM?
THEY SHOULD BE WHITE - WITH A SUBTLE OPALESENCE THAT CATCHES IN THE SUN.
Last year my brother stole me a winter coat.
Maybe you should ask her that way.
I don't want to see you anymore.)
Im talking about love and relatenships....men wanting that blonde bombshell when the right one might be Ms. Average person
- she just may feel the same way!
u definetly shouldn't have done that hoodie thing.
verbal abuse is just as bad.
Then, listen and follw her advice!!
he just does little suttle things he never did
i have tried to get over it.
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER DON'T YOU?
ill say yes or no when he ask me.if you asked me ill say yes
Has not done ANYTHING... anything means anything... so can you be Gay?
Dirt scums looks more macho and are carefree...
just tell her how you feel and if it dont work out move on
When he's away, you wonder if he's cheating.
she could have a lot of STDs
You just climb on board and holler, YEEHAW!
in the end your gut is usually right .
no i dont having kids is not easy mmm and u must be thanxfulll for that
anyway, good luck and merry christmas!
Is it what they buy you?
It does not matter you should buy the person a gift if your they BF or GF
If you don't beleive me take a chance.
!--GUYS DONT CARE AS LONG AS U HAVE A HEART BEAT THEY WILL GO FOR IT.
Because they do not love the person that they are cheating on.
because there are other easy women out there
Some of the guys I know are mean.
Guys with no guy friends are huge turn-off for women (until they start dating you, lol).
Women don't deserve men who treat us like trash.
Walk up to him and say, I like you, can we be friends?
Yes there are girls that are not worth dating.
Call him and say it's over.
GET A HAIRCUT OR NEW CLOTHES.
How else would you not be able to figure it out?!
AND RELIGION DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IN THIS CASE.
when u just say it and dont wait for a best time to come
THE ANSWER IS B'CUZ YOU FEEL GOOD HAVING THAT PERSON WITH YOU.
if you are a young person that is thinking of having sex, i encourage you to wait!
No matter what anybody says gays are wrong.
and then she will be like umm...
What in the hell are you doing with a married man???
If she moves in a little, than kiss her.
I say get an education and then worry about that!
No there's nothing wrong with you!
If they are in love with you, great.
But this i know is just the want for sex and nothing else.
OR SEXUAL INTERCOURSE IF YOU'RE AN ADOLESCENT.
being hurt is hard, but you need to move on.
its too bad women are not more easily aroused.
you shouldn't be with them because you deserve better.
Plus they get the best of both worlds by not admitting to it!
I see you on here alot.
u r looking in the wrong place.
ALWAYS GO WITH YOUR FIRST FEELING CAUSE IT TRUELY WILL NEVER STEER YOU WRONG.BELIEVE ME BEEN THERE
you and this friend or just yourself are experincing lust, and lust is not better then love.
with friends like that you don't very well need enemies, now do you.
it will make the kid happy, and you double win.
at least not in the wrong anyways
LOVE IS NOT THE QUESTION IN LOVE IS THE QUESTION.
trade her a pack of twinkies if she breaks up wiht you
o and hes a sensitive guy
but think of what the future holds.
So you asked, what is god's name?
PLAYER To EX- PLAYER True game is just what it sounds like.
Try to be tolerant (and TRUST ME I know you probably feel like you have been).
If you like her, then tell her.
start a web site called young girls then hire all you want with the proceeds from the site
and then think of something they both can enjoy.
just go ahead and follow your heart.
If u want a peace full life dont behind money.
i think if i did that so the gift will not be a gift
Infatuation... ...says, We must get married right away.
And no, you wouldn't see me with dirt scums either they would either be police officers or military.
If you find yourself thinking that she is one in a million, then go for LOVE.
Just remember it is WOMEN they are cheating with!
that means not calling him just a friend or someone you know!
has your sex life diminished any?
Dude-- only YOU can answer that question!!
It means that his love so deep for that he would do anything for you.
Thanks everyone for ur reply !!
just because a woman is fat or ugle does not make them a bad person.
And also someone to do the heavy work (ha!ha!
no you are not fat and yes you can get good looking man
And who knows love better than books eh??
What Do You Smell Like ?
Just between you and her,IF u can do that.
If you do this, B is already implied if youd do bothe A and C.
I mean the girlfriend not the crush.
men think it is easy to make someone happy that is already happy.
bots just anoy us while we are chatting
If I was a girl I'd be gay.
wouldn't it depend on number of people invited?
Once and ex leave them an ex.
The man takes this as why didn't you call?
girls have no clue what love is.
if your desperate than make the move!
And Not trying to impress her..........2 Much!
i don't think he'll do it voluntarily.
but i love him to death.
LET THEM SEE YOU AT YOUR BEST.
u better treat him 2 date...
the average  penis size is 5.5 inches hard
That way you can get used to it.
Depending on how u look at it and mean.
Honey, if anyone knows anything about being a little hoochie mama it's me.
Hmmm... Vin Diesel b/c he's a hottie.
there are some who are looking for that and personallity but most are looking for mostly good looks.
Unfortunately, all of em cheat so not good guys.
They haven't been togeather for very long!!
i knew her, and he always said they were just friends.
he/she might be the one you are in love with :D!
haha that is a good question, girls like a flirt but not a hoe!
I don't think you wanna be Tina again.
You like someone because of and you love them in spite of.
because guys are just interested in looks.
And NEVER let a man do that to you again.
Sounds to me, you went after a high maintence girl.
I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THERE'S 4 THINGS THAT MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK LOVE, COMMUNICATION, UNDERSTANDING AND TRUST.
2 types of Love: Love 'the verb' & Love 'the feeling'.
Right i just said it to you.
because being mean for them is to find themselves and being happy
Then all you have to say is I L-O-V-E Y-O-U
Yes, but why would she want to?
They had a bad first-experience C. They think guys are only after sex.
*wink*)   Good luck......I'll be rooting for ya!
you are creating bad karma for yourself....and kidding yourself if you think it will go no further.
`coz she was a virgin before you
If you're a hottie and not a bimbo and he doesn't call back, HIS LOSS!!
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T SEE IT LOOKING AT THEM.
don't worry , she will forget him when she will get 18
Little shy girl, I see you have posted a lot of questions.
does he not want to see me?
He may go to jail too.
a partridge in a pear tree....damn it someone else thought of it first!
Or ask yourself:  Am I ready for a kid?
i think the most men if like each other , they would don't care what woman looks like physically.
at a special restaurant, or if you're outdoorsy, at a pretty lookout place.
i wouldnt cheat on u if u were nice
i'm sure that any girl would be happy to hear it :)
I honestly believe that most people are bent on what other folks are doing.
how can u identify true love?
because maybe you can try me 4 size.
Maybe you're just not this person's type....
you wouldn't sleep the first three days , but later things , will go better !
yes you should because that very bad to forget someone birthday or christmas too you
I am gonna wish people Happy 2006!
no my wife wnt give oral sex i know how you feel call back
May I take you out to dinner?
so why dont u fight for it!
I don't know why but I just can't help it.
and it's toolate to turn back.
Just make sure the person your havin sex with doesn't have an std
we just think about us because we are scared to get hurt,and relationship come and goes.
So b cool n U r going to b allright !
i found the profile under there.
Listen dont look for love because if its right it will find you!!
well if you really like him you could give him a little more time.
if he comes over on saturday say oh well we wont be home tomorrow and probably not monday either.
Do women do this to men?
is it really fair to love one more than the other?
PLEASE HELP ME I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!!
you have to think of everything..
I think you should hang out with him more and fide out if you like him back
i dont think the money was everything in your situation.
just want to know 'bout general thinking
heres what the recording will say.
and everytime i tell him its over, he wont leave me alone
The internet does have nice people on it, just set your limits up front.and patiently wait...........
she is living with him now in adultery.
Not about how nice a guy is.
no its not if you realy care about someone!!
or else, go to a city and pick up some not-so-good-looking girl off the streets.
be original.don't copy someone else's idea.
its hard to tell with men am i right?
probably 20 percent of married people.
4 the  way to react well just say ie to me agian  i dare you  love, dev
if not, i wouldnt have him in your bed doing anything exept holding for your reputations sake
when you are willing to risk something to be with that someone
you wouldn't want to have a child and never know about it, would you?
If you are just having a tough time...
he has made no advance in a sexual way and they have gotten abstinance rings.
The movie line, don't say anything
No, i wouldn't pack up and leave.
guys prefer girls that know when to be naughty and when to be nice.
But that does not mean that career and money are not important.
However, if you still got some freak off in ya, you might wanna try some threesome action.
because good girls are gullible and bad girls want it too....hehe
but i'll never go back, never.
Or maybe, men are afraid to hurt girl's feelings about it.
learn...grow...enjoy your baby, i doubt they will.
THE MONEY DOESN'T MATTER, THE LOVE DOES.
BY HOW YOU PRECIEVE HOW HE TREATES YOU
and at night... kiss her like none other!
Us Guy Need to think with are BIG HEAD NOT with ARE Lil Head.
go to aol.com and find chat then find that room.
EITHER IGNOR HIM OR TELL HIM OFF
it will make her mad as hell
Get rid of both of them.
But good luck, and happy gaming.
YES SOME DAY THE PERFECT MATCH WILL COME ALONG
if u do this it is very very weird i still think its weird to this day
If he did it to you ... you know the rest.
some people dont even have the money to buy things.
If he does have it(which I doubt), just break it to him easy.
1. good human being 2. help other peoples 3. fill my life with love n happiness
Maybe one day ask her to the movies or something.
ignore the exs, go for the new girl and be open with her
Would you ****WILLINGLY**** spend your life with her until you die?
You wont believe this anyway ..But age 52
I've liked this girl since i was 19 y/o.
hey your name is great....becase its the name of my best friend in chandigarh too....
Look around her room or apartment to see the kind of things she likes.
is there any girl from punjab.i want to make her my good friend
you don't always get the response you want and the truth isn't always flattering for us.
diamonds always show how much your wife means that you are willing to spend it on her.
If not, try to give him little hints.
I HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT.
names, does the child have his father's last name or yours?
bE OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT IT AND DONT BE SURPRISED IF PPL LAUGH.
i'm tired of all those ghetto @ss guys trying to be pimps.
But don't be a wuss either!
well i can't tell you what it would be like cause i lived with mine my whole life.
wait until you have been dating AT LEAST 1 year!!
u must choose one of them regardless all the difficulties
Except, you could start flirting with her.
If you get started today...you MIGHT have something in hand by xmas.
Not tonight honey I have a headache
See if she wants to have a go at it.
Why don't you ask him to invite one of his boy friend ?
THATS THE EASIEST THING TO DO!!
If you think he is not, then dump him!
its 6:34 on new years eve and im all alone.
IMO you DONT love your boyfriend.
j/sayin this happened to me last week.
cause they are pretty and sexy, soemthing between the ears would be helpful.
If she is not screaming it, try asking.
What's mom trying to tell you?
might have something to do with thier childhood.
there are some lines that just shouldn't be crossed, know what i mean?
i don't think u'll find easly .... girls always think themslves rare
or try to find my true love?
for some reason we always want what u can't have.
u have to choose between the two as to whome u love the most.
It sucks realizing love never existed where I thought it did, but was a life lesson that I've experienced.
Don't let egos to come in.
or were you pisst because you didn't go?
I'm 15, too but I don't worry about it at all.
if you think hes attracted to you then go for it!
Do yourself a HUGE favor and get the heck out of there!
go and tell her, that u miss her
or is it just a physical attraction?
Once a cheater, always a cheater.
lol dont know what type of girl u are....i hope i helped
I LOVE CHICKS WHO DIG VIDIO GAMES

Ditch him you can do better

i had the most fun day ever!
oh yes, just don't subtitute, use the real ones.
I probably first told mine when I was a little kid...
Hi,your name here..... Then she will respond.
Two: Why did you get divorced anyways?
(Rarely works, if it does be careful)  Where else...
Why not just get a man?
Dont trust... **** her forget her
If he didn't care he wouldn't have a problem admitting that he cheated.
There are men out there that can focus on multiple relationships....I mean friends, family and especially YOU!
I dont know what it is, but im dead serious.
yes i think some guys will love for who u are not how you look.
You are generalizing right now......so why do women cheat on guys.......What is cheating?
FOR BETTER OR WORSE REMEMBER SHE LEFT YOU WHEN YOU WERE DOWN I WOULDNT WANT HER BACK.
Three: Track him down with a PI, like Inspector Claseau.
would you be alright if you tried it and ended up hating eachother?
!just go directly to what ur weaknesses and redirect it!!!
How would U like it if U were married and UR husband cheated on U?
commitment, Sense of humor, Love And some money too won't hurt
no sista, i don tink so.
I don't want to eat here.
a feeling that can never be explained
Do you always look your best?
ask her out to something neutral, movie with a group, dinner with friends whatever just make it casual.
we split up because he had to move.
True love stories don't have endings!
Love is when you like someone alot.
if it hadn't been her, it would have just been someone else.
i always start my love letters with,  HELLO BEAUTIFUL, OR HELLO SEXY
if she's mad 4 a dumb reason.
age aint notin but a numba.
!anyway just always remember we are all humans!!
If you truly like this guy then be his friend.
If you really like the girl.. you know what makes her happy.
Where you always not so interested in sex?
3rd, keep your legs shut until at least the 3rd date.
we say that we love you sometimes just b/c you say it first.
And then I would think about 35 more years....
just watch football and take your laptop with you!
wow....have u talked to her since?
it's fun doing it and watching it to
maybe even a guy who isnt in juvinile.
How do you know love is in you??
if you have gay intensions then try it - see if you like it.
hey im fat to and ive thought of killing myself but i thought of the poeple i would leave.
WELL WELL WELL WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?
Goofy you can relax with and mysterious guys are just too much work.
or u cud txt... or msn... just dont do it rite in his face.
there was a man in my life.
if he did something bad then no if he didnt then yes
If you work with them think about getting a new job.
Even the savege & covetous nature of man leads his eyes to the things he wants.
find your self a good man that wont just use u find a real person like your self.
get her plastic earrings from clair's.
GO TO THE DOCTOR AND HAVE A LIST OF YOUR SEXUAL PARTNERS.. SOMETHANG AIN'T RIGHT
you wont have to ask yourself that question if he or she is the one.
You have to remember that what you children see...they become!
Ask him, if you did it would it make him uneasy!
'Hi, I am blah blah) then say can I join you for a drink?
You know, guys are not sure what to say or how to say it.
please send any help info that is available.
How About   Hola  Just wanting to let you know that I can't stop thinking about you...............................     Hope this helps.
no wonder your avatar looks so sad.
I was just curious cause I wanna try with my boyfriend.
depends.....if u dont care for ur current boyfriend...then go for it....otherwise, stay clear.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE SAYING THAT THERE IS SOMEONE FOR EVERYBODY?
I like nice music dim lights and mmmmm well I won't when I am angry :)
looks dont really matter to girl.Be funny.
DO NOT attempt to do this with someone you know.
If there are more girls than guys hanging out, opt out, at least for a while.
its not a very good relationship if he only wonts sex... write a letter and neva see him again.
someone to make them feel secure and treat them right...a best friend for ever and always :)
Thirty, because you know what you want and who you want it with by that time.
well...it actually depends on the guy..... but if u ask me its a stupid reason to break up!
Dude its like asking what can i do to grow.
Get over it, something like that would be a good enough cause for a break up.
but he didnt tell me that he was moving his cosin did .
the body language... she will laugh at everything.
Only if he makes less money than you do.
BUT BEFORE YOU DO THIS...go through your wife's closet and look at what styles she likes.
Oh, belive this one, if he don't want you to go or know where he's going, there you go.
now i am working retail and i like what i do.
NO if you hear that they are wrong or lying.
if he is single tell him that you like him in that extra special way and see what happens.
dump him..dont get used..u will mess up ur life and u will have big problem in future..
have you tried stalking, that tends to work.
if he hit you once, he might do it again.
You don't really have to ask her out persay.
YES I WOULD HAVE A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP IF THE GIRL WAS MY PRFECT MATCH.
So here's your holiday  Hope you enjoy it this time.
6 to 6 and a half inches.
both have the same level of perseption!!
i have a freind and i could tell him any thing and trust him with my life.
You shouldn't ask out a 14 year old, that's too young!
then you can look for weighted or heaver duty ones.
Im so tired of him... it;s not even funny.
There are men who are not like that.
If you want romance, give it.
and please dont let yourself develop a hard or bitter heart!
well, 1st of all, most of us men do seem sex crazy to women.
Yes, even if he's in jail.
They say its great to not have to worry about all the bs some guys bring with them.
not very hard, if you're hott
if u r looking 4 a 1 night sex, i would say that person u meet is worthless
If you don't really care about her, then go for the career.
Uhh, if you're a man it sure does.
I don't want my son to know because he is only 8.
Try to find someone who is better and ....do not hang on to the past.
I love ya so much I wanna have sex with you and so much more.
)if he refuses/ he's not with you anyway.
if your boyfriend needs space, give it to him before he cheats on you.
not only your body matures with age, also your mind and character.
Girls worry about their skin like crazy and she'll run a mile before getting close to a spotty face!
:) much love to you in this hard time.
Cuddle, kiss, makeout, and then help him get some relief.
when you don't have to ask anybody if you are or not.
it applies to guys and gals both.
how to approch them and ask them?
Damn, I want that for Christmas!
just think about all the bad, that can go with the good :)
you just have to learn to trust people.
Ipod with her favourite nos 2.
Part of it says:  Kids Can't Cause Divorce!
we just got back from a trip that lasted 10 days meeting his parents and such.
romance is the ultimate key... rose petals...music.
work it out or move on and quit playing with your heart!
here comes the train of the obvious question answerer and next stop is you!!
yes sweetie if u r  still comfortable with him u shud!!
Bring her flowers...flowers are good.. remember that!!!
But...I have a 'friend' that put a note on my car with his name and phone #.
As I said before - Greed
Yup that should about cover it.
Wait until your late 20's early 30's.
i would cut ties with so-called fam member/friend.
Hi Sweety, I used to be bio.
if you really care about your friend, find someone else.
I mean, I like 3 different boys and I think that I may be in love with them all.
If your girlfriend too aproches him then you should seprate from them...
any more questions e-mail me at allarcon88@yahoo.com
Homie you need to check your self, you need to only one and stick with it!!!
The one thing that women need to learn is NEVER TRY TO CHANGE A MAN.
THAT DEPENDS ON WHO I'M WITH.
Youve lost that loving feeling....  affair
im 19 and married to the father of my 2 yr old child.
: I was straight until my 15 b-day, bisexual from 15 - 21,I am gay now.
ok.. there is this girl that is absesed of me.
In a relationship, romance and talk, is a 2 way street, not a one way :)
;)  But do talk more when you're around with crowds.
screw the roller coaster of emotions and living lies, i'll take the good guy!!
Any ideas as to what I should do and what I could get her?
If he says anything negative about girls asking guys, then maybe he isn't worth it...!!
no u want to stay friends w/ this person right?
just a thought...things that make you go hmmmm
So they like us naughty and nice for sure.
(This is when she wants casual relationship with him.)
well if you want to remain friends after the break up then no unless you have marriage in mind
and you need this 3 things mature enough to enjoy sex.
They both have very good points...and DO NOT HAVE SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE!
I take it that you are a Christian.
You won't believe how many girls hate sex because either  A.
It is not just men, women are like that too.
likewise, don't get him anything similar.
for all ur question u have to depends on the girl's reaction and response then her movements
try to sneak around and get an idea of what she likes first!
well, lucky you if you only met such guys.
Ask what turns a guy off instead.
after u see that there all gay shoot them
To keep you for himself - not many guys want to date a p/g woman.
i'm still looking for an answer
my fiance and i are going to have two weddings.
Just hang out with him, and act like you like him.
If he is a sports fan...he will be thrilled if you are too!
I never hung around gay people being raised.
Girls that just sleep around don't care if you tell them you love them, they just want to fuck.
keep your lips relaxed, at first you dont even have to use tongue.
the last one i was in i married the guy.
BECAUSE MEN ARE GREEDY AND THINK THAT THERE IS MORE THAT WHAT THEY CAN SEE.
i saw u said that u have been with only two guys and u r 21.
You find the right guy someday.
I dunno, even if she like you, and then she'll prob.
Because they think in the same way like us.
Let me tell you that really does hurt
just waiting for him to make up his mind
yours was not one of them.
Like me in lots of ways 3.  mentally there, but doesnt need to show it 4.  likes math
because we can beat off to them when we cant hump a hore
you'll be ok, i left my ex over a year ago, and i still feel for him.
No, I dont think your wrong.
so try to become a better person at least u may end as good person.
and the next day say srry again.
but never stoop to his level by trying to get revenge!
women can take the man out ,but don't make it a habit....lol
But once you are in the friend zone it is really hard to get out!!!
THEYRE NOT FULL OF CRAP...EVER HEARD OF A STATE CALLED NERVOUSNESS???
i actually had the same problem with another chick.
Women go for men with money even if they're total jerks and abusive, not for REAL Love.
good sex is.... not all sex is good.
she is ready to be kissed.
Hang in there DON'T GIVE UP MAN.....
not in love but in like
Thanks for playing I hope I got this rite (jk!)
Well I used to call it cuddling with my girlfriend,you call it hanging.
i mean it might sound good now but trust me- DON'T RUSH INTO IT!!
Don't believe anyone who says there is!
you should be flirty with one person and not every woman in the room... not a good idea
A FREND IS A FREND AND A LOVER SOMETHING DIFFERENT, CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DISCUSS WITH YOUR FRENDS, I.E.
I can not imagine life without kids.
If the juices are still flowing then GREAT!
leave your husband and find a new best friend
If a guy becomes involved with a girl, does he have to cheat?
give me an instance....yes i am single go figure.
What did your best friend do?
trust me girl, it is damn near impossible to stay mad at somebody taht you truly care about.
Please, Write what you think Ok ?
girls like jewelery, flowers and expensive things
I thought he was a great guy - perfect man.
to much sifting through the sand and ur gonna find a broken glass.
reach for his crotch im preety sure hell respond let me know if not:)
My world is brighter because you walk in it...
wow that was hard, mentally retarded or just fantasizing about him too much?
why would a girl stop loving a guy who realy loves her more than anything???
jennifer lopez is the right one 4 me......... ;)
Maybe you are dirt scum, and the 95% to which you speak are good guys??
have you tried beer and pizza??
a lot of gurl will deny it and say oh i only like personality but we realy do.
it kinda blew up in my face.
Just checking this out,because i was curiuos when i found it.=)
Not all girls care about money.
its called revenge girl and believe me, it is worth it to be rid of that untrustworthy jerk!
Flirt with eachother the whole day and night... And whatever you do, PUT HER FIRST.
Both girl and boy are living happily ever after!!
get it tattooed on your chest.
he's hot and funny and hot and sort of smart
Best shape n models to d eyes of anyone doesn't gaurantee d best !
make her a basket of personal favorites
I don't want him to go else where.
Bring her around ur mom more.
yeah u can its weird but then again the way love works is strange itself
if so then just show up and see what happens.
if not just turn her down and tell her how much you apreciate your friend.
i am 23 and i have 2 kids with my husband.
Yes, men do need attention, but women need it too!
You said it beautifully already, now just say it to her.
they care about no one except their self.
yes, but they can never get divorsed so, but you can
we will probably get married one day and have talked about it recently.
think about it i mean seriously what do u think it feels good
But remember, pretty n sexy gals also like handsome n macho man !
however, spending time with people you enjoy and who like to listen to gripes helps a lot as well.
his answer is good enough for me...
perfume...not too expensive, but it shows thought and care...good luck.
yea the r and t are right next to each other on the keyboard lol
believe me i'm there i'm like that with my ex boyfriend and we are only friends now.
they're probably little kids who think it's funny.
it worked 4 me i don't kno if it will 4 u tho... srry this is like a novel
NOT ALL SOME OF PEOPLE IN THIS GENARATION...
I used to go from partner to partner, with friends and anyone, even girly friends...
And girls do go for a good aftershave - that means the expensive stuff!
Some pretty n sexy gals n handsome hunks stinks !
IM AFRAID I WILL LOOK STUPID!!
dress up nasty and do unsual sexual things ;)
Sure, head off to the alter!
umm i wouldnt get jewlery for a female friend.
By the he looks at u
Go to her favorite store, go shopping together, make it a fun day.
then, flirt him back to you!!!
Sex is not that big of a deal.
Being a full time mom IS a job!
forgive and let go, but don't forget; just use it as a learning experience.
Focus on finding a mate, NOT getting a girl.
WHO BIG OF A BABE ARE YOU?
imagine all the kids that look up to me what good would i be to them.
We want a FAIRYTALE at least i do.
Tell them you are in love with them and experience the best sex you ever had !
Maybe you really don't want a girl friend.
they would never do anything to hurt me eather
Concentrate on school, where there are probably some nice boys you could be friends with.
usually those don't last too long, but they're probably the easiest.
usually if she's talking to you she likes you
But some people say that i shouldnt get to serious because im at such a young age.
Someone who I can be totally myself, good and bad.
well maybe u r too young or u just want to keep your free life.
of course not,  go ahead and goodluck
I wouldn't have cared so much if he would have at least told me before-hand.
Sometimes girl dont wanna start to talk the thing that can make her really sad.
so that's what she might be doing.
Don't expect him to pull this off, it's up to you.
do somthing really sweet thats says can't stop thinking about u.  sent flowers and tell her how you feel
First, it really sucks that you are homeless!!
look at what she wears and get her something similar!
He had been sick but now it is crazy.
if so that might be his way of asking if you didnt deni it.
If you know like I do, you need to wait.
BUT IF HE OR SHE IS THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT!
what should we do when we se a sexy girl?
my dads wedding was for free cuz he knew the preach they grow up to gether.
Hope it helps Most Excellent One  ;)  Gary
Once a snake, always a snake.
2) BE OPEN  TO EACH  OTHER  SO THAT BOTH BE COMMON THING AND MAKE SURE NO ONE REFUSE .
Anyway, I can’t think of more right now but good luck.
Yup :) I met my first boyfriend online, as well as my husband.
You don't want to hear *anything* about her ex-boyfriends or stuff like that.
But most of them are the rude kinds, make fun of you etc.
after you said yes, no you are not wrong.
You can't unless you are the one that filed it/
And if he or she didn't tell you, well.
just kind of gently suck on his lip... dont try and eat his face... just nice and gentle.
im thinking on seeing my mom but should i call her first or just show up
She is too young - he is a grown man.
Got any hints from her or ideas?...use those.
Does he take a shower the second that he gets home?
maybe thats why u dont want to have a gf.
It can't be some guy or chick on TV or romantic guy off of a soap.
i dont have any money to spend on this.
ALWAYS KEEP THE GUY WANTING MORE, DON'T GIVE IT ALL THE FIRST NIGHT.
Thats when things went down hill.
get out of your mothers basement.
the bigger the man, the bigger the ego which is a turn off.
we aren't psychics..but if you have to ask..chances are you don't have much faith in the relationship..
I've never heard it before....but I like it!
try ur query using google.u can find many and if u find any good do plz tell me :)
and dont go with sexy in your name.
Not at all - in fact it is a Very good thing if you hold yourself till your marriage.
sometimes people cheat because they find no other way out!
I know, this sounds horrible, but guys like to believe they can get any woman any time.
You should just try out some fun hot sex with a guy and see if it feels right.
no i didnt love my husband and left-kids are fine
I have the same kind of relationship so i say YES!!!!!!!
Ask her best friend for ideas  Vince C, Orlando, FL
just become rich they will like you then
depends if you want to or not
follow his eyes and connect them with his moves and reactions then u'll find it out
I FAILED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.PEACE OUT!
Because there not a real man.
Just dont try to make yourself grow up to fast.
But i perfer not to talk about that with the person im with.
I know this one, honestly, I do.
(Material- I know, but I don't know him to say anything else about him but his looks)
i think they have too much time on their hands.
Well, if he just FORGOT, that is not a good excuse.
i dont have the haurt to tell her to go away.
She wanna talk about it, but she cant.
or you want something really bad because you cant get it!!
As for you, don't ask for your gifts, that's pretty lame.
for now at least, don't talk to him, keep your distance until you cool down a bit.
Have you ever heard the saying,BOYS WILL BE BOYS?
Go ahead and leave her becuase she deserves someone better that a loser like you!!!!
If you love her, tell her.
I have twins and I get sooo many matching outfits.
are you sure he's working out at the gym?
If not, and you still want her back, don't file either.
If you like her, start flirting with her.
Making out with guys is really gross.
If not, you should not worry...
told her as of right now i'm rash free; would you be my girl ?
why dont you just ask him?
not if its importantif you just rung to say hi several times in one hour, that would be annoying
plus if you have children and things don't work out, where will the children end up?
Don't waste your time on the low-life looser!!!!!!!!!!
your perfect obidience in every way.
SOME women tell lies...SOME men tell lies.
If you chunky or not it doesnt matter its whats on the inside that DOES matter!
you two only see each other for the time.
if the boy tries to keep it secret, its still gonna get around
But I never let my family know.
One more thing...don't use the word awesome at least around young women.
Tongue   her til she gets off.
Go and have a good time dont worry about them.
keep looking for that person who will love you, and isnt taken!
Don't think it is a waste of money, atleast its a way to find your mate
HE IS CURRENTLY IN BASTROP COUNTY JAIL AND WANTS TO GET MARRIED WHILE HE IS LOCKED UP.
If you do, I guess you do (5 years!!!!
By the time I realized she wasn't kidding, she shruged her shoulders and walked away---Strange but True
Tell him to mature and start reading up on pregnancy.
CHUCK THIS RELATIONSHIP INTO THE CAN....CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP ANY LONGER.
THIS MIGHT TEACH HIM A LESSON,IF THEY LIKE EACH OTHER HE WILL COME BACK,BUT WITH A DIFRIENT ATTITUDE.
are men or women more persuadeable to cheat?
If she doesnt notice you im here!!!
So, I'm kinda sittin' and ridin' this question with ya, seeing what I can learn.
When is it a good time to give out your phone #?
I hope this helps a bit.
The thing is she wasn't bad looking at all and I think she really ment it.
what does your gut instincts say ??
Don't walk around thinking Well golly gee I'm not at all attractive so how will anyone ever like meee.
most women wont lie you just havnt found one that is going to be honest.
wouldnt call it dating but hey if you can create all the necessary backstory why not.
I'VE DATED A LITTLE SINCE BUT I REALLY LOVED HIM AND I GUESS I COMPARE EVERYONE ELSE.
OH AND I M VERY OPEN MINDED I HAVE DATED WOMEN BEFORE.
aww i love what ineedlotsofhelp118 said!
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PREGNANT
Nope...but I think it would be hilarious if it happened LOL
i guess when he starts to like men
Why are some guys more horny than others?????
becasue women already have all the answers
even if its just a sentence.
I don't feel right around them.
God, then Mom, maybe ur grrr if'n ur lucky.
money is good but i don't go on looks.
by her doing that says a ton of stuff about her.
gone so young by amber pacific is amazing
did u say a joke then she thinks u are funny.
i m not a virgin.. but i dont regret it.
simple is boring, complicated is not...
I like Craigslist and OK Cupid.
What do u think I should tell them?
She jumped him but he got up.
Once a guy said, Nice to see you.
Tell her to mind her own business and if she don't like the way you do things to bad.
and i  want to call him again but would it bother him?
five minutes sounds kinda wimpy if its a usual time thing and not a quickie with the kids downstairs.
the first on,if this some extra baggag isn`t very extra:)
he only said hey to me once.
If you believe lesbos are cool then say so and if not then why?Me personnaly well I am one!!
why isn't he moving in with you that is the real question here!
im also very loyal to my girlfriend.
No flower, no candies nothing like that.
do not beleve if they say love is a feeling!
If not, your just wasting your time.
(dudes, and others, this is my cousin asking this, not me, lol, I dont swing that way.)
BECAUSE THE GRASS IS ALWYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE.
because she is insecure and doesnt want to be alone, it is called co-dependency!
Help, I don't know what to do!
well first, is there any way you can tell if he's been active on this account or not?
If you try to find love, it's so easy to see things that aren't there.
I do not do the bar seen because I do not drink, so what do you do?
or try to laugh it off.
well there is actually alot of different points to this question.
i've actually met four people i chatted with in online dating sites.
You obviously dont love her if you gave up when you should be there for her.
no he is not a cheater.. the rings not on the finger yet.
TELL YOUR SPOUSE TO SEND A POST CARD ABOUT IT FROM THEIR NEW ADDRESS!!!
so we secretly ganged up on him!
he really liked me, so i pretended to like him, and we dated!
any tips to at least hide it?
Do you really think he is a bad guy?
Wait, I forgot a good nap is up there, too!
ask her what she likes and doesnt like.
So I thought I'd ask you.
however he shouldnt be leading you on with pillow talk.
i find it kind of new and interesting when a girl says that they like me.
FIRST, STOP GIVING HIM MIXED SIGNALS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM, HE WILL INTERPRET THEM AS LOVE.
If it is, nobody never cheats.
if she says no forget her
If u will look at my photo .... maybe u will wish to have 3rd bf !!
i personaly go for the guys with blue eyes and blond hair.
And what if things do not work out?
coz i had it with a person ... who is my best friend
Gifts dont always mean he love you.
I honestly don't agree with most people here.
Was there someone that cheated on you, that made you upset at girls?
I never get enough kisses and hugs.
people ask me that for my last question
Infidelity, I say never get married, marriage is the #1 cause of Divorce!!
i've always been the type of person who falls for my best friend.
but if he does it to you again.
It's just not worth the safety risk.
not saying youre a bad lover but some women take a really long time to get off.
you don't know you have to trust him
pls help me out here truthfully.
MY BOYFRIEND JUST PROPOSED ON CHRISTMAS AND I DONT KNOW WHERE TO START.
Ask, but never hide your feelings.
if u like mt advice e-mail me at tech_boy001@yahoo.com
They are out there, we just have to start acting like one.
folk got nothing better to do and will read anything case in point..........
Surf P O R N online, or MAS TUR BATE.
If you just told her a funny joke then it is a good thing.
money is good if your thinking about the future or just a suga daddy.
suggest that you date others for awhile.
I met my fiancee on the internet!!!
Not all girls are like that.
wait till he is ready if you really love him you wil wait till he is ready good luck
!even if i start to do dating by net!!!
i agree, start seeing other women.
You haven't found a good guy because you've been too busy with this loser.
they don't give up the sex  answ3r3r
That is what women like, real guys, not fake guys
or ask him if he still likes you.
make sure its okay wit your cousin first.
i will make a bloody love story for our p.e.
Because if he LOVED you he wouldn't put you down or cheat on you.
First of all, don't just bust out with I LOVE YOU!
looking past the text..ask your buddy (best friend) what he thinks...never know..might work out
Life is to short for the what if's
Cuddling with my husband and reading a good book!
well that you will find out more later...
If he says he loves you but is not in Love with you.
Maybe its because some girls have something the other gurl doesn't have!!!!!!!
I have already asked this guy out once but on a message and he didnt call back.
i hope some body answer me becuase this thing really cause a proplem for me????
Good Luck and try to do better next time, God loves you!
instead of focusing all ur attention on ur partner, you just think about other things.
tell them the same thing i do .
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS DON'T EVER LET HIM MAKE U THINK ITS YOUR FAULT.
There, I said what you want to say to her!
instead just tell him you had a massage with someone and unexpectedly you had an orgasm.
i got to go now and take a time out
cuz this one girl is confusing me
if u do search for it u may ot with a false one.
men nvr understand girls...  ....its ok we nvr will
You know it is like a marriage.
ask her for the DVD version, vhs tape will not last!

show confidence and treat her well!
I make great friends on here.
He is kind of redneck type of guy, in good sense of words ;-)
designpro has it dont ever give money or pay bills for someone you are dating.
What should I do to flirt with her?
And he continues.......  ......the next day you see it again.
God blessed me with that special someone, i'm 31 yrs.
or you could think about all the things he could of done behind your back.
First, if you love him I don't see how you could even care about his looks at all.
Luckily I haven't had to start a fight.
I clapped my hands and my face shows it too!
BEAUTIFUL FACE WITH SOME EXTRA BAGGAGE.
because guys are turn on by sight.
you just have to do the research and ask around to a couple places.
its a nice question when u look at it.
Basically... dont dwell on the past
Then again-who says a girl couldn't have both:)
maybe that is the motivation he needs.
And the other guy goes to the college in the next town over.
People read everything they just don't always answer.
TO GET LUCKY PLEASE GO RETHINK THAT QUESTION BEFORE YOU POST IT ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB
A peice of shit that hangs from your ass hairs.
lemmi know ..  as soon as u find 1!
They like a guy who listens.
hold her hand and snuggle, give her lots of kisses and hug her real tight.
lol I am going to take a stab at guessing here and say 12 times in a week.
Women have it so tough these days.
well.. just sit back and think... who would you give the world for?
Don't look for a problem that isn't there.
Not until both of yall start going out will he like just you.
So how and the heck am i too meet a partner if i cant talk to strangers!!?
definately a liar.. and possibly a cheater.. my ex boyfriend did the exact same thing
uhmmmm how about looking for a job.
take it from me its not worth it
he's keeping his options open incase you guys don't work out
after breaks you should go to bathroom to do sssssssssss&sisisisisisiisiiisii....................
Oh, I wouldn't be happy with that at all.
forget her and them then u'll find them follow u ... believe me
take it from me its not worth it
he's keeping his options open incase you guys don't work out
after breaks you should go to bathroom to do sssssssssss&sisisisisisiisiiisii....................
Oh, I wouldn't be happy with that at all.
forget her and them then u'll find them follow u ... believe me
if you are thinking about sexual things about that person, then it is.
If you plan on getting married I really hope it's for LOVE - Good Luck & Happy Holidays!
they are only uncomfortable if you wear em on your head.....
You just have to be willing to take that risk.
I guess you don't:) just kidding, try your best and see what happens.
apparently, this guy has issues... with himself.
Its not gonna be a quick fix and it takes time.
That's what I heard once, & thought it was cute...
My ex-boyfriend's sister and i used to be really close.
And what would that do to your self confidence if it didnt?
have fun untill the ride stops, then get off and get another.
my husband made me a pair of half caret diamond studs!
How should I become a ladies' man?
But what if it doesn't work out?
But one time I asked a girl for a date, and she accepted!
when you don't talk do u miss him?
what r the things to talk about.and how do u do it inorder not to piss him off.
O.K., those are my quirky turnoffs!
no we actually do listen but you guys can give such silly answers?
its not that big a deal,then from there youll be able to see where his heads at..
He cried, but wasn't really hurt...
mn_sassygal you can lie to me any time whooooa what a dish
does this kind of love last for ever?
maybe not now, or soon, but one day she will cheat.
:) Not so bad is it?
u could always try just talking 2 him and see what happens
mabie he wants you to leave.
if you dont ask you will never know.
write & i'll tell u more  By the way - u r appreciated for your help on yahoo answers.
SO EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S REALLY OVER HOW CAN I GET THESE FEELINGS TO STOP?
See if you can get her to hang out with you as a friend first.
If you try to be sth you aren't you'll just look silly and girls sense this kinds of things.
id ask her and if she says yes she cheating then yeah she has to go.
it's just something you feel deep down
Eats lunch with them 3 days a week.
Lately I have been feelin guilty for bein wit my man, but, thinkin about this other guy.
stealth setting are like the ignore buttom?
MOSTLY HIS CHOICE.I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET HIM OUT OF MY MIND.
WE HAD DIFFERENCES W/MY KIDS AND OTHER THINGS SO I TELL MYSELF IT WOULD NEVER WORK.
when i realize that some one like you cares to ask me that.
Most people don't even get that.
Take a left when you get to hell.
That way you know what you're getting into.
Because you're thinking he's not okay.
- To a man = mon chéri, pronounced [mo(n) shay ree].
Hey, that's a cool necklace you have there!
I didn't like the French way, it felt too dirty.
Not very good, since it looks like a whole bunch of people already did!
If you cared about those days at all you won't want to carry on the really bad ones now.
nowadays women should take the hand of control all the wedding side
she will also think of it as kinda dirty that she did someone her best friend did.
You can't... that ship has sailed.
about four to five times a week.
never try to be bitchy, doing so wud only make matters worse.
i think that means that she only interested in in only boys .
it depends but most girls ive met like mature guys with a good sense of humor.
hmmm,i dont know why...but when im in a crowd i feel crowded...know why ?
u know those things that a woman does that sends off warning sugnals in ur head?
Wow, orgasms from just getting a foot massage, man are you horny!!!!
Never use a pick upline on somebody no matter how funny it sounds.
U should only have sex if you are married.
IM is a good way if you don't care too much about him
i would definitely go for true love!
But that didn't stop me from the best one nite stand i have ever had.
Yes ... and farted too ... but not during the same episode.
you just have to find us.
We're all gay...it's all about what u prefer
If she just want to have casual sex with you, just enjoy it.
Just say I LOVE YOU 2.
a walk in a park,feed some greese,something like that.
When was this golden age anyway?
i think a kiss is harmless, so any age.
Worst is, she will not answer her phone or e-mails to explain.
I guess because nobody cares about others deep down and they would rather sit there in self pity.
it will find u thts the only way
but i'm oldschool and think thats appropriate-maybe i am a dinosaur.
lets vote and put it to rest
WHY DO MEN CHEAT ON A WHEN THERE IN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP????
And do it before the other guy does!
Because we are just attracted to the opposit sex.Thats just how it goes.Try It!
this may sound hard but best way is: to start dateing again.
Like, I met one guy today for lunch...he was very nice, but I also chat with other guys too.
Maybe you just ain't cool enough.
be confident dont think negative make ur mind positive.
Choose the restaurant......but say, I chose this because I want the best for you.
If she is not interested then she wont care abt you or what you say.
Dumped her sorry butt and found me a good woman.
Because they get the male species hot!
A thong is more like...underwear, swimsuit...  A G-string is flimsy, for lingerie wear  They are BOTH butt floss, though.
maybe he had it on there and forgot about it?
yeah they would , yes i image so if thats what they want
i woke up with him on top of me and his***** inserted in my cl*t
He's a jerk - get rid of him
I found the person i was destined to be a little 2 late.
i still call up one of those women  every once in a while to go out for a beer.
most gays wont admit that they are.
But the point is......you need to tell him!!
usally it means the cat/dog needs to go for the night before going to bed
you wouldnt buy a pair of shoes without trying them on... why should sex be any different.
if you aren't happy move on.
A friend of mine told me this is normal...im hoping she is right!!!
now, if it was an artist that did modeling on the side, i'd be in like flynn.
I gave up looking for the one and once I stopped looking, he just kinda showed up.
let him watch some adults movies :)))) kidding...  ask him what does it make him stop?
NO please do not feel bad - instead feel good!
who goes to death by his own will!!!!
If I were you I would question it and be worried...
2. don't ask do you love me if you can't reciprocate.
Or, in plain english, ask her if it's ok... :)  -w
right now she is the backup plan if you don't come back,dosn't sound like love to me
)and if u don't u will feel having lost out on a important and beautiful relationship.
dont harp on the issue as that will only drive him away from you  (guys see it as nagging).
because what you are doing is wrong and it woun't last well.
Avoid it like the fiery pit of you know where!
They aren't you just gotta learn thier language.
Oh, and I like a good cup of coffee and sunny days.
coz I am not a native speaker of english.
I don't want any drama, i just want my dress back.
are there not enough problems with this world?
Hm, let me think about that....NO!
Don't ask her if it's OK.  Just do it.
hey my dear friend dont worry man.
My answer... most men don't (from what I observed).
THE SAME WAY A SINGLE MOM DOES!
i think its hot when a girl is a virgin... most guys do.
that's tough, its an unusual setup.
watch 40 yr old virgin that movie is kik ass funny and it will give you some tips
SECOND, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE HE WILL END UP GETTING HURT NO MATTER WHAT.
Ask your ex-boyfriend this question:  Is it ok for me to date other men, while im with you?
and how sweet, and kind you can be!
old and we have been together going on 4 yrs.
there will be drunk nights where hooking up is all too easy.
and explain to them that they should be happy that you have found someone to make you very happy!
put down the magazines and go out of your house.
Did I just cheat on him?
you might also wanna talk to him and see if he likes u how u like him.
next time you get jiggy with it ask her if you can use the vibrator on her.
and she is wonderful.. now it's a parttime job you don't like?
Some guy just want to have fun, other guys want something more serious..etc.
How do I know so much????
its hard to forget things that were between you.
if its pass then let it go.
Well hun if u decide to meet the guy that is when it becomes dangerous.
No sweetie, this is not cheating.
just try to remember its their loss not yours.
both men n women..  well..difference is that.. men r more desperate for sex..while for  women.. commitment is also important!
In 10 years, when he has that big old beer gut, look back at him a laugh!
(uggggllllyy)  anyways, there are some out there, but they are few and far between.
just wondering cuz of the holiday season
honey i would drop her like a rock....she is not worth it!!!!!
if your happy but it's other people that are not happy i.e.
Not at all, you just want that special feeling you get from it.
Love is MORE THAN THAT its that you just like to be with,work with and trust your life with.
Most men could care less if they married or not.
?may be on the street !
you already know what you should do.
Do you not wanna help him?
see if she is your tipe
call her and tell that you love her
DO U THINK HE MIGHT NOT FEEL THE SAME WAY?
Casablanca  (can't believe I'm the 1st to tag this one)
That isn't fair, and wouldn't you hate it if someone did that to you?
It literally almost broke me down because he said our love was neverending and I loved him so much.
because you're dating the wrong people
I am sooooooooo lucky to have him :-)
However, don't worry, there are still guys like me out here.
In my experience, love always seems to come my way when I least expect it or want it.
then get out quickly/cleanly, take the children!
Good luck and just so you know i would think it was pushing it to.
i like the look of jennifer love hewit and jessica alba but hey thats why its a fantasy.
Get over your self and let him go with someone who thinks more of him that you ever did!!!!!
OR  you could try casually starting a conversation about diamonds......that would work too
some thing is lets get in bed
should i ask him what he meant by this or should i wait until he says something.
show her your sausage and if she smiles then she likes you
If you are really worried you might just want to get a paternity test!!
how old is ever1 on here
Tell her that you need some privacy, a little time off, alone time:)... stuff like that.
ya never know until you try it.
but dont forget she is your sis and no man is worth it.
outdoor wedding..lots of colorful flowers, jewel tone fabrics.no silk florals
it could be anything and he's just to scared to tell you
entice him by showing him some skin........ a sure fire success.
After they'll b relaxed, feeling great & ready to thank you!!
49-52 is a small group, you should be looking at the 40-60 age group.
it's not as scary as it seems.
you better give her a dinner date.
breakups are hard but youll find the person that is love of your life.
Problem is, I still love her.
you need to leave him right now, its only getting worse from here.
don't let her bat her eyelashes and convince you its not.
What should I do now ?
only guys here the the secretaryy is like super ugly and about 25 years older than i am.
It really depends if the guy really likes the girl or not.
not.it is not cheating you just  start or trying to cheating
you should start your life a new.
OMG so ask him to go study with you in libary!
a 10 dollar gift card for a thrift store.. LOL
Everytime I look into my girlfriend's eyes, I can see the beach.
u dont have love without a lover!
Is he SURE he is OK with that?
u just have to be ur self.
I don't belive in the lifestyle!
Take a breather, (I'm sure he is feeling a little bad too) and go cuddle with him.
I dont care about the diamonds or the cost of my wedding ring.
yahoo personals is number 1.   match.com is number 2.  you'll have better luck at yahoo.
No it is not bad at all.
So, don't look here and there ..... just stick to the first bf.
Easy... ask yourself if you would take a bullet for him.
But then I wanna be with my kids and husband.
Alright, so you and she have the same taste in guys.
DON'T MAKE A FAST MOVE, BUT USE THAT GOD GIVEN INTRUMENT - UR MOUTH.
ppl read anything they can get to.
1 of my friends cheated on somebody and they HATE her.
but falling for everyone is not right.
ok, if you ask nicely I will.
Remember: Men are from Mars women are from Venus
cus you guys are a handful.
Do you want to get married??
Hell, you've known him for five years!
The wilder the better, I don't want someone who just lays there.
(Interestingly none of them would dare date a black guy!)
YOU GO GIRL AND STAND UP FOR YOURSELF YOU HERD ME!
guys don't care about telling them romantic things.
Whatever Jason says will lead to a war and will not be effective...
Barefoot on the beach with just family and a few close friends.
YOU NEED TO DO SOME INVESTIGATING BEFORE YOU ASSUME THAT SHE IS CHEATING.
So should I give him an ultimatum?
fool me once shame on you.
should i hang on and wait.
yes there is I have a best friend relationship
and if he says YEA, kick him in the crotch.
Anything less than that, forget it!
talking sexually or intimatly with anoyone other than your spouse is cheating.
we're [the girls] just starting what they [the guys] did years ago.
evrybody does it... try it, its great
whoever you are dating now put in on hold until you are though with your divorce
i'm yet to discover the same!
Especially if you're not the girlie type.
there are so many things think about first.
The female brain is far too complicated for that!
I know it sounds superficial, but wow....wear good shoes!
But on the other hand (u woman - ya'll r sneaky and devias sometimes.
(psst, it's the 6th string on the guitar)
so suck it up and ask him directly already.
instead wait for the true love to find u.
have a nice life.then find another.believe me there are plenty out there
if he does move in with these girls make it a point to be around.
and try to do things for little money to begin with.
if he's your ex, don't get him anything!
love is not about the size... is about the all the rest toghether...
Never give up or stop trying, its too important
so you should really take time to think it over.
if you are just chatting about normal things with no intention of sex, then no, it's fine!
so that guy who u like is also a gay?
if you have to ask that question, just walk away
honestly if they did u think they'd be so amaze with the fact that we have em too
She didn't want to quit doing it.
My boyfriend and I just don't have much fun.
i think if u ask any woman though respect should be #1 on everyones list.
not having much fun just now, are you???
u and the friend need to keep quiet
!but i don,t know wether it is my fault or society fault?
cuzzz they are women they have pussy and butt that why.
Couldn't stop thinking about the other man until the one I luv came home.
but sex is a bigger issue.
go to one who realy knows what love is and then ask: Does love change?
Some girls jsut don't know how to say no, same as guys.
well girls and boys do the same thing.
if theres a second date, thats a good sign
how i can enjoy her sexually
slower is better than faster except for the occasional quickie...lol
I bet you she will want you then!
look for a guy who does not attract you.
if their happines means more that your own.
I'm a married guy that loves shemale porn.
If you don't think that that is cheating then NO you did not.
If they cant stand it or get used to it maybe you shoud move.
maybe your not enough or good enough for her that she has to use it
email call drop a note yeah its okay to ask.
she's drunk passed out laying there isnt she ?
its right next to your heart.
k what he told u ask it to him back
Ask yourself if you only fall in love with forbidden fruit...?
Is it so you don't get caught looking?
he told me he is tryin to wait it out with her.
they should go to dinner and a movie.
Sure, people do it on line every day.
Cheap Trick, If you want my love  Now give me a 10, thanks.
or if you really fear the rejection then tell one of his friends that you like him.
You sure you know what you're talking about?
DON'T TALK TO HIM ABOUT GUYS YOU LIKE OR ARE DATING, THAT WILL ONLY HURT HIM MORE.
boys like girls personality  and their looks.
It doesn't matter how much sex you've had, I wouldn't use that as a consideration at all!
a guy that takes the lead and stay in control
so you can please her better so she can forget about that vibrator!
sounds like you are just interested in appearence, check myspace groups
maybe he's after that green card
I say go for it and enjoy it !!
?,,,nuttin to worry bout in my opion
That's how men think, we're a simple people!
because some people do not like other people.
yes  and by the way - where have you been asking that question for the last 10 years?
sorry im at work with no messenger.
because no one told them not to lie.
Just always remember ur family does love u and always will.
you leave everything in a mess, and expect us to pick up the pieces
tell him the bitter reallity slowly with hand in hand.
If you need to dissmiss him, then do that too.
no i met my baby online and we've been together for 4 years now
I gave him a note, but he didnt reply yet.
if u realy luvs him, juz go ask him whether he or not?
Not French ... the language of love ... the most beautiful sounding language ...
WOW I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
But it would be wrong if you actually did it.
if she's just messing, flirting around then a quite talk wud do.
You don't trust him or you wouldn't be asking.
But trust me not all women are flirts.
forget her with a little spit - even she don't diserve that
He or she isn't worth it.
the day she doesn't like having it, maybe after a few hundreds or can she count after that!
i tried to call him but he is either not home or nobody picks up the phone.
but you cannot make him want you in his life.
HE RAPED YOU!THAT'S RAPE IF HE DIN'T HAVE YOUR CONSENT.
if u are a cheater yourself u are certain to get a cheater.this is divine rule.
How do I get a bf?
it is always appropriate to tell someone you love them, even if you don't.
true love...money will fade away but true love wont.
dont get involved and ruin a marriage.
If you have to start counting on your toes...
After u will say hi to her try to show what a person u r (im about personality).
give to her a flower today and a present on christmas
an ideal wedding spot would be near the beach on a sunset setting.
oh ya there is always some body out there for everyone.
for share our thoughts & love
to qoute sir mix alot I like Big buts and I can not Lie you other brothers can't deny.
show her that you really care.
But i do belive in love online!
Don't be afraid to take a chance.
NO BUT... IM COMIONG FOR YOU I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
it kinda backfired but it was worth it!
give him flowers.give a good bye kiss.
sounds like were in the same boat.
i would go with the artist
The word friend itself reveales the story--FRY-END,, SO DO I NEED TO EXPLAIN ANY THING MORE????
I tell him I don't like him he say's he doesn't like me either!
Come on girl, get up and get your baby and leave the fool.
and i was in graduation final year.
Did he ever give you reason to be?
Being happy IS THE RIGHT THING!
NO UNLESS YOU TRUST HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART
And no other guys in the picture to be jealous of.
if not then find someone else.
i like to let my 2 boys and the big tree hang loose every now and then.
Dun u have specific quetions than open ones??
MARRIAGE WONT CHANGE A THING EITHER WAY!
there's  a big difference between a crush and love.
hes a d!ck you dont want to associate with players   like him.
Mom always told me not to talk to strangers!
If you are like me...once you love, you always love.
All men find something in women that they love and eyes arn't always it.
(trust me this works 4 most of the time)Good Luck :)
I'm going to bring my family with me i'm not that stupid.
put the computer away and go for the real thing that is right at home waiting for you.
if not talk to him about it if he loves you he will understand
Do you know what your saying?
GURL GO ON LATINO SITES U CAN MEET PEOPLE THAT WAY.
they want all of your time
he's just not that into you.
If he persist, then get 'ghetto' with it.
cz they too will think the same way about us.
because it taste like banana cream pie!
Since you have raise the point,I realize that too!
i wouldnt advice eyeing another person's gf.
im asuming you are a woman.
Now back away from the computer dude...
also compare them with a list of what you like/hate about this person.
you should ask yourself if he loves you so much why isn't he leaving?
I had a crush on a guy for 3 yrs.
I once told a gay friend to be careful or he would get AIDS.
there's a lot so i'll try to narrow it down to 3 things.
BE HONEST TO HUSBAND,LOVE HIS FAMILY,DON'T SAY EVERYTHINGTO HUBBY,
IF he gives you a bad time about accidentally losing it...RED FLAG.
do what your heart tells you to do it is the best thing right now
Now, now...there are great dating sites out there.
SHE DEFINITELY WANTS YOU TO !!
no chance at all..i've read it.
for me i dont know how to lie and i dont want to know either.
This is like asking, how do you know if your straight..
So stop looking, and just hang out with your friends and have fun.
or do u believe in love online?
You know, maybe they'll invite you over for trist!
Be careful w/ the company you keep.
Brunette for sure...who said Blondes have more fun?
If you're an idiot keep posting stupid things alright?
WELL MY ADVISE IS FOR YOU TO TELL HIM HOW U FEEL.
he wont be worth your time.
there is no way u can be together?
Brunette for sure...who said Blondes have more fun?
If you're an idiot keep posting stupid things alright?
WELL MY ADVISE IS FOR YOU TO TELL HIM HOW U FEEL.
he wont be worth your time.
there is no way u can be together?
eventually, reality sets in though but you are still always happy.
a nice dinner a movie and a soft kiss :x
I never miss an opportunity to tell her.
Does that excite you, guys ?
Just another way of spicing up thier sex lives.
just tell them that you dont want a marrige right now.
and what  tune  to  talk  to  him  in ?
It goes back to the cave man days babe.
GOOD LUCK AND REMEMBER IT'S NEVER YOUR FAULT.
because thay fell something inside of them and thay want to have you know what
its beautiful, might be hard to come by though.
when she says no dont be a stalker it will just annoy her and get you in trouble.
I guess, she just missed her son.
1. for no one every to get sick and die only die from old age .
i was wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me on friday?
its beautiful, might be hard to come by though.
when she says no dont be a stalker it will just annoy her and get you in trouble.
I guess, she just missed her son.
i was wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me on friday?
if it does work, there are trust issues at hand.
i want a beautiful girl with good attitude and a down to earth personality may be its you>>>>>>>>
I was going to simply asnwer 'about what?'
It F** annoying when I don't feel like talking(communicating) ............
Warm cocoa makes peeople feel in love, you know!
you should set things straight with her.
try to be your self and just start a conversation with one and hope for the best
dunno what else willt ake ur own judgement
she cheated on me but I still love her because of her courage.
I told him i didn't like that and I wanted to kiss him but with no tongue.
You won't know unless you try though!
but if ever that happens to me, i wouldn't be able to get over it right away.
sorry man - do u live in theran ?
They would not love you if they did not care of your well being...
NO but farted did i say that lol
she tends to giggle and become sort of shy when your around.
show her the man you really are!
Mmm...before you decided to left him?
so what mental hopital do you go to agian?
i don't think many are very smart because they've used their looks to get away with many things.
It is definitely blond!Blondes have this special angel look going on.But they gotta be naughty angels!
Just don't call like every 5 mins.
Then give her that stuff and LEAVE.
but half of them were  bad in bed so i wasted a lot of time on the losers!
let her know you trust her judgment on everything and that it is all about her.
You are just hanging out in the wrong places.
things that most guys do to hurt your feelings..let me know..
If you dont wanna lose here, just trust her.
they also think that they want a listening hubby.
I think it's more accepted that men cheat.
first of all she shouldnt do that.
gifts are not perimeter of true love
She just seems the kind of person you could just sit down and talk to!
IF HE SHOWED UP AT MY DOOR I WOULD PROBABLY REALLY WANT HIM BACK, BUT I KNOW I SHOULDN'T.
well that is jus my opinion but it is what you truly think
so in other words just be yourself and if she doesn't like you then she's not right for you!
Because women think alot of things that don't make sense.
Girls hardly ever use an obvious pick up line with men.
(ok I also giggled.....but wow....horrid date!)
he may of had it on there before seeking for a gf.
Have a couple of beers first...
don't tell him you had a massage with a guy cuase i think it will make him feel bad.
if sex is very good to men do they wanna keep coming back to you?
WE MALES HAVE BEEN IN PRACTICE FOR YEARS   BEFORE WE LOSE IT.WE ARE READY BY THEN.
if it is the past then it shouldnt concern u except getting tested but yeah u should just talk.
It keeps everyone wondering where you are going and who you are going with!
You should be asking a lot of questions.
He needs to show you he wants you!
Alot of money would be nice, won't lie.
I pick it up and just stare at it.
reality is that you are not gonna get such a girl.
would apreciate helpl with this difficult problem
There is NOTHING to make up!!
call on the phone and ask her out
cuz love dose not hurt you!!
If you have at least 1, then your set!
THEN EVERY ONE ELSE HAS TO UNDERSTAND.
she will always think you two still have something going on.
I going to wait 5 or 6 yrs after I get engaged .
LET HIM GO, SOON HE'LL REALIZE WHAT HE HAD!
Since you already called him once, donot call him again.
whta is the right words that i should say to this kind of man?
i would have to say yes,i would not say that unless i liked the girl
the guy above please note that its grammar and not grammer.
its a good place to lay were head on and because they dont have boobs.
as long as you are good to her, and its ok with her, then yes, stay with her.
I was a good looking guy to begin with but I was just shy.
Sitting at the beach, watching my kids play.
Shell think that ur way 2 serious to start.
Oh I so have the same problem.
whch ever ones work out more (depends)
theres some things that need to change or i'll leave and i can't even get him to listen
GIMME 10 POINTS PLEASE  AND  CALL FOR VOTING
Having one girl that you really care about can be very satisfing.
I wasn't doing it for the money but because I loved him.
HAVE YOUR FRIEND FIND OUT IF SHE LIKES YOU AND THEN GO FROM THERE
Then proceed to have cyber sex cam to cam!!
Or do what the other guy said, large members work too.
But don't just go in at the speed of light!
you shouldn't have to try to get a boyfriend, it should just happen.
Us guys only think one way and thats the easiest way to get punani.
Just be yourself, treat her nice, give her a date she'll never forget
And boy was that a mistake!
oooo girls like to be complimented.
Try to flirt and then be cold.
But even then... you best bet would be child support.
Some guy liked me when i was in 6th grade and it wasn't sincere.
give her a red bull and she'll fly away just like in the commertial
YES, your baby's father is your husband only
If you are sexually attracted to the same sex then you are GAY!
no, date who u want to date, it will be ur girlfriend so ull want to like her
C'mon man, if you really love this woman, you won't cheat on her.
if woman has royal blood she better not get married cuz that blood is not sposed to mix
honey, if it's taken him this long, probably not
Isn't that trying to gow up a little too fast?
(There's more questions coming about her.....HELP ME OUT HERE PLS)
we dont wanna be thought of as 'easy'.
dude, if u think she likes u, go for it, if u think she doesn't, look for someone else!
Her ex-husband cheated on her, so she cheated on him to get back at him and then left him.
Lets refraise ur Q: why do Weird guys confess to me?
Oh my gosh, your on cloud 9.
it is not all about the sex.
I had butterflies in my stomach b/c he scared me.
I know u heard this b4.
if you don't tell her, then nothing will ever really happen.
HOW DO I DEAL WITH IT?
neither ill just keep dating my girlfriend
thing and tie yourself to just one person...you should be getting to know all sorts of guys.
the cougars are out there...and they will find you.
maybe his is a virgin, or possibly waiting til he's married, maybe he has a std or small penis.
if you guys are friends i think it is best to just stay that way.
She said she is gonna call me and let me know.
What is wrong in it, if she likes another guy and have friendship with him.
a ring is just a ring
i wouldn't put up with it if he says he wants to marry me, because marriage is permanent.
SURELY YOU ARENT THAT DESPERATE THAT YOU HAVE TO GO ON AN ADULT SITE.
Only if the girls are sexy though.
Just that the girl is straight(not a lesbian) and somewhat immature.
You just sort of have to help it become perfect.
The situation i'm in now, my guy has to go threw catholism classes.
there is no future in it
sometimes the boys that dont talk that much pay more attention to their girlfriends when they get 1
Maybe he wont mind if you werent even there
shell flirt with you and be nice to you.
I'd be a rich mofo right now.
The only thing I regret is that I married the wrong person...lol!
If he is a geek or nerd  thinkgeek.com
some place that is not full of noise !
And please, don't ever get married simply for that reason.
yes it is because then she would have to cheat and that would not be good
think of things to say to him.
jst say tht he's the best thing tht ever happnd to u in ur life...
There are a lot of stupid questions on here... like who emailed me last!
Every girl wants to be asked out!
but if she doesn't like you back that way she will feel akward around you after that
well.. when u feel that that the person u like..gets on the top of ur priority list!!
dont  ask sexual or questions that pertain to the crap that she usually gets at a club!
2, and u now wat 1 of them barely even talkz 2 me and treatz me like crap!
Girls like to play hard to get... not knowing the age here..
how u  can be sure   that    the   wife too is not cheating the husband.
A lot of guys want that too.
well do you want to marry me then sence its so urgert to you that i am.
Listen & listen & listen & listen & then talk.
HE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY MAN I EVER TRULY LOVED.
and what i should do to overcome this proplem???
that would win me over in a heart beat!
money, cheating, in laws, no time spent together
u had to ask : does the exist love??
Milk In La Frigerator or My Ignorant Little Friend
His girl hitting on another guy right in front of him.
it's either your appreciated or funny or you got something on your face
also, ask yourself, do you feel bad after doing it?
ask her if you can buy her something to drink and sit and chat for a bit!
not interested in rekindling the love you once had.
tell him that there is a a sports ilusttrated swim suit model out side waiting for him
If you are the same age go with friends and check it out
do you really mean that because i think it is really bad to date online
You ask him to stop and he wont hes bisexual.
well, first off she put boys instead of men.
But, if you would risk your own life to defend his...  then you are in love!!
sometimes i feel i should because he dont see her anymore.
The best advice my mother ever gave me was Marry your best friend!
YOU DONT NEED THAT IN YOUR LIFE.
AND WHY DO WOMEN CHEAT WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING REAL GOOD????????????
The guy's got issues he needs to work out.
i am 26 years old and untill now i don,t have girl friend?i know nobody believe that !!
flirting is healthy...cyber sex is cheating....
I am in my mid 50's.
if u meet nice boi then they would like 4 just doing u.
maybe he is a christian and he beleives that u should not have sex untill after u are married.
As for your answer.......I wish I were an 8 ball......a prophetic soul.......but I'm not.
Damn... now if only I could take my own advice, lol!
thats what i did and it worked.
You just have a high sex drive.
bECAUSE GUY ARE SICK PERVERTS WHO MAKE US THINK THAT!
Of course you shouldn't go out with him!
like they all said very slim!
Try to meet real woman off-line...that's the hard thing, huh?
But I also cherish my female friends because they are awesome, too!
If you do what this then keep doing what your doing.
Dear, You are friend even now.
maybe he actully did lose your phone number and he likes you back.
ask her about her and seem interested in what she says!
THIS WILL BE HARD IF YOUR REALLY REALLY SERIOUS.
TREAT HER LIKE IT WAS THE FIRST MOMENT THAT YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.
what if it was a part-time job you didn't even like anyway?
well if u can amange a long future with them then your in love
have a talk about it with her dont yell or get in a fight.
maybe he thinks that ur trying to break up wit him or tell him sumthing that he won't like...maybe!
tell him you're pregnant and see what happens
what would a woman do that would make u faithful to her and eat from her palms?
most women are pretty shy about voicing what gets them off.
listen this happend to me alot.
am i going to believe in him?
Couple here    Not often enough, cause of the Kids!!!!
I KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR FAMILY, BUT THIS IS YOUR CHOICE AND YOUR FUTURE CHOOSE IT WISELY.
Dont take it seriously I dont mean it in a bad way.
find a girl that you like and treat her nicely and just be your self.
if U wanna have a relationship online, just keep it at that.
My fvorite aunt is dying, I can not take anymore deaths!
Myself, I always stick with the can't go wrong routine.
Get on the net on a webcam.
go to a nice restraunt and eat n talk
then again, if its not from before you guys got together then yes, he is a cheater.
men w/ men is not beneficial to anything, man with woman makes life!
Once they start looking, we girls can get whatever we want from them :P
I told him to call me and he had not.
guys are more about what you do -action based expressions.
well, if you really like her...I don't think I would ask her out...have you heard the term rebound...?
Why can't you ask him out?
If he loves you... he loves you!
i joined her in her english coaching class.
always smile and be energetic.girls dont fall for money u can have cute gals around u with ur humor.
And, how do you determine, if you like the them, once you meet?
neither are what you would want him to think if it's not true.
be clean and neat, smile, self confidence, self-confidence, no real woman wants a weak scared man!!!
well girls have a tendency to think they are acting different when they actually are not acting any different.
you know she wont be obsesive or anything like that.
yes and i have done so in the past.
this guy choose the option of not reciving instant msg
Hmmm...well, wait to see what happens with the guy and his girlfriend.
Well if you're not just trying to pick her up you have nothing to worry about.
all women love it but most guys are to stupid to realize it
I agree with NOT just offering her unsolicited advice...what a turn-off!!!
Best of luck to you Jolly Roger!
be yourself after all thats what your best at so take my advice go with yourself
Go to my 360 and check a few pics i have listed.

Regardless of what anyone else thinks.
Why do YOU HaVe-To have This gal???
Bang his best friend, have someone videotape it(or tape it yourself) and then make him watch it!
I almost always have to initialize the quick pecks during the day!!
No once a cheat always a cheat.
I think it is not sufficient to give one's views...u should specify details
And her cousin, and her neighbors.
Just pick the one you like
I didn't die or even explode.
but that would be too direct.
WELL,EVERY WOMAN/MAN WOUL LIKE LOVE BETTER,EVEN IF THEY DON'T ADMITTED.

Also, don't EVER give a girl money.
Cuddling on the couch and watching tv with my family!

Of course I don't live in NYC.
we are not complicated is just that we are too cute to get what we want
There's one nice thing about having a car without auto-locks...

most guys i know with looks are absolutely pig-headed, don't have a personality, or are completely stupid.
a lot i can't count.lol.no seriously i think about 25...gee!
well, i play the drumset, but i'm not hot!
just ask someone u like out
How well should I know a guy, before meeting him in person?
B/C MARRIAGE CHANGES EVERYTHING IN THE RELATIONSHIP!
if they keep callin you AFTER..you tell them to quit callin.
Hi, you like me, do you think i like you too???
At present I don't have money for day care, maids etc.
just tell him youd like to go out sometime?
they are just afraid to be alone!
but he is a real nice guy.
Even now i am 39 years old.
i think you should think about this.
Start there and she will lead the way to the rest.
first you cant allow or unallow him to do anything.
if they cant believe you and get passed that then they arent your true friends.
There is not just one answer as their are also sex addictions, mid life crisis etc.
just ask her or comment on what ever she is looking at or doing and then go from there
remember the grass is always greener on the other side, until you get there.

maybe she is telling you that you please her so you wont feel bad.
i'll agree that you just need to tell her how you feel.
Sometimes I love something or someone so much that when they let me down.......I HATE IT!!
They like mature guys because they want someone who know what he's doing and not trying...
now thats a quesion worth answering
no i have never sneezed during sex...but it would be really funny if one of us did...
make love to her, dont just have sex (if you are in love with her).
little boys dont really ever like girls.
i have slammed peoples heads in their lockers once.
If your answer is no, dont read any further and dump him right away.
WE TELL EACH OTHER I LOV YOU EVERY NIGHT.
Make them WORK for your love to.
Dodge Ram; it's a pick up
because she didnt do nothing wrong.
jesus man, might aswell shoot myself now !

It depends on who dumped who.
(member of a) body men specially picked and trained for carrying out raids and making assaults

you should find out what your parents dont like about him and .
0% unless you are a computer you read it while writing it.
no why should u suffer .
do you trust people online ?
But DO NOT LET HIM USE THIS AS AN EXCUSE.
thats wat i want a rock hotty but not a sex freak
I would invest any time you have in learning about attraction......  Hope this helps....
Seeing each other is not dating it can be that yall are just friends.
Then let me give u a little advise on how to get her to go out with u.
Read his book - UltraMarathon Runner
Can all u girls help me out with this>
just tell him to back off.
because if she likes him there might be problems in ur relationship.
Good god, leave the skimpy underware to the girls!
They know the laws here too, I think its if they marry for 2yrs.
cocky guys or guys with the playboy mentality are BIG turn offs.
If you already done the best you could?

Also, in top ten is: i'm a lesbian, but i'll make an exception with you...
depends the age honey....really, no timje is the best time...
show her that you like her by asking her out to the movies and going places with her.
and a ring cannot influence that.
if you like her enough to risk that friendship just be honest with her.
The rest look at men for sex.
and its either to feel sexy or to not have a panty line
I hope I am a big help b/c I have a 13 year old guy friend, too!
*looks in the mirror*   There she is!!!!
you should never speak to him again
Before she slaps you and think you are a complete perv… and the world goes to hell...  :)
I'd rather not have a slender girl.
Buy a ring, get down on one knee...women are allowed to propose too, you know!
Bummer... Really don't drag that cross around ....
6 at school...once after and once on the phone...i think im winning (in the non-married catagory)
you feel you love him but he makes it hard for you not to like him!
you could try to think about all the bad things he's done.
My wife has no idea that I do this.
Good Luck to both of you.
Gotta have trust in a marriage.
know what your lover want best and get it if you can affort it.
tell them to mind there own business.
i like this girl but i think she doesnt like me back what do i do?
If he is worth marrying he will wait and you should wait.
You can also try the Yahoo!
I wonder how would *you* help her out?
If it CAN happen, it WILL happen  :)  Cheers!
But don't act like this didn't happen.
well, i am a 30 years old guy.
tell him your true feelings and you might be suprised.
fool me twice shame on me.
Well i just want to try and get him to like me.
i like the blonde, but i love the dark red.
All the while watching her go through guy after guy.
So when I don't get it enough, I go searchin for the boy to give it to me!
Rule 2: If she's wrong, reread rule 1 :)
and what purpose does it serve other than fulfilling two confused peoples lust for one another!
LIfe is complicated and its just the way it is.
That joke about the baby was funny.
If not, break up with your girlfriend and do what you want.
what do girls want from a guy?
guys dont play games only girls do
if you would have asked us earlier, you could have got a YES long back!
he used to be really sweet and do things for me.
Good luck with your shopping :)
Adam... and ask him... why man have you made this stupid mistake... :P

I would get rid of her ASAP.

Mistake #1 - cheating on him.
simply tell him u don't like him and if that doesn't work find a new guy
you need to work on your english... spellings and grammar.
What the heck do 13 yearold guy's want?
Girls like guys that act like jerks.
i want to get to know her but what should i say?
it might be infactuation, not love
What does it mean when a girl puts that she likes 'Boys!'
yeah porno stores most nimphs advertise what thay want hope ya size up.
its like two for the price of one.
it's perfectly fine, there's someone out there for you.
I go for the beautiful face...
AND IF DONT TELL HIM, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IF HE WAS THE ONE.
Seriously though, its gotta be quick.
GOOD LUCK AND LET ME KNOW    ELIZA
So it will take the both of you...  Bless you both and best of all to you

So guys growing up with a dad not showing them about chivalry.
'I'm going to go hang out with the boys.')

Not relatives, someone whom you want t o pick their brain and ask what ever questions you desire.
Surfing P O R N, or mas tur bating, is a great way to relieve sexual stress.

Bang her mom, sister and best-friend.
Have you ever been a victim of a bad/funny/or rediculous pick up line?
Pull out a gun point it at him and laugh.
if i told you... it wouldn't be secret.
not me  not him ended up..both mad... any suggestions in how to get happy again?
if your not happy brake up.
most of them will have their own chat there that they use.
Tell him nicely to back the hell up.
She just can't find a single solitary guy over there that likes her?
If she considers it to be cheating, then it is cheating.
WELL I DONT AGREE WITH ANYONE HERE!!!!!!!!!
Or maybe she's just a sl*t.
and dont go dutch but you can say lets go see a movie ill get tickets you get popcorn.
Um...wow,lmao.I guess they like to be around them,I really have no idea...wow.You've sen that?
same reason women cheat on men.
ANY WAY, ANYBODY THAT PLANS TO MARRY SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT THERE GETTING IN TO.
unless you want an open sexuall relationship with her, get out now.
He sounds a lil fruity to me....
he's heart broken, she says she's not ready for a relationship thats all
DIRTY WOMEN are as likely to cheat as DOGGISH MEN... Men just get caught more.
but my friends don't want me to because they are scared that he will come kill them or something.
DONT EVEN PAY THEM ANY ATTENTION AND BE YOU.
Tell her to F**k of, just kidding.
By all means ask him straight up if he is gay or bisexual.
Anyone with self dignity would not go back to person who's like that.
Just like anything else in life.
Do things you wouldn't do before.
the sirens only go off once every 2-3 years.
Anyway that sounds hot, I wouldn't drop her, but I don't know if I'd marry her.
Have you tried kissing her yet?
if the guy  hve  a  wife?
If not, then you just like him as a friend.
It's just what I'm attracted to.
for example there is a women a that we work in the same place,i am new there!
But wit my baby its more of a mental thing!
so good luck on what ever your decision may be.
Now, get out there and meet some women who area ladies and ain't slut_s!
if she cheated on him then she could just as easily cheat on you.
Flowers are not cheap...depending on what kind you get.
As for best friend... all my best friends are men and so am I and I'm straight (I think).
give her something about yourself the she can brag to her friends about
i did it to get closer to them, not for the sex or anything like that
how you gonna start a fight and get beat down.....LOL.
why would he want to kill them is he like a murder
you need humor in your life to keep the relationship going.
i think ur negative attitude is spoining ur time.
Ask yourself this, is she worth waiting for?
trust ur self and be the king in ur sight
but even a little check like that would be worth $15.
Might be a little hard to find...but CHECK IT OUT!
Just keep doing what your doing.
this is how you avoid being creepy gym guy.
if it bothers you much more, report it to people with more authority
i would want to stay friends, so no
reinforce that she is always right, no matter what the circumstance.
the airport is a very public place with lots of security around.
BUT IF HE STARTS THIS QUOTE GOD COMPLEX AGAIN,DROP HIM AND CONTINUE ON.
1 to 3 times a day.
I stopped that by telling her if she don't like it stay your asss at home.
How long does a quickie run?
I THOUGH THEY LOVE YOU A LONG TIME??

But let's be honest, does size matter?......
Whatever you do do not cheat on him to get back at him.
Better start saving these gals from ???
Just be yourself, and have fun!
YEAH BUT IF SHES A TEASE WELL DNT WHO WANTS TO DEAL WITH A TEASE
wow that is a good anticipation.
short or none everywhere else...  it's my personal taste...
TRY THE PHONE,AND DONT CALL FROM HOME OR WORK.GO SOMEWHERE HE WILL NOT FIND U.
no matter how u tell him he is gonna hurt if he really love u like u said.
If not think as its over and get over with your life.
Not really a great option, eh?
cant seem to get over this.
i don't think ur boyfriend would like another man touching you.
If it smells good it's go!
He just might not be packaged the way YOU think!
when it's totally bullcrap and the girl is totally innocent would you belive him.
what would a woman do that would make u think forever?
something like, will you go out with me?
I don't know but I read it
if the boys cheat, then they are losers.
DONT LET HER HURT YOU LIKE THAT
it potentialy could happen...and it sounds fun!
I never got to tell him exactly how I felt.
Guess,  I know how yo feel.
You could just approach her, tell her you've seen her here almost as often as you (!!!)
be yourself...be nice kind...treat her like you want to be treated...it's easy once you get the hang of it....
(He might pick it up in a single ring!)
u have something to lose both ways.
because u didn't face the true love till now
all she cares about is spending time with you.
Never let em see ya sweat, at least this young.
you got issues......go to a doctor, a psychiatrist!
like i don't like to have fat bf or husband
match.com and if your jewish jdate.com
Women ( not men ) are the driving force in pressuring men to marry much less buy overpriced rings.
(get a divorce/leave him first) Mistake #2 - calling him stupid.
teenagers use the internet for homework plus it's winter break u know for christmas.
what about races of kid's grand-parents?
they were boys (of course) lol
It looks like he is foaming at the mouth,(yuck) but I love him!
!or have a detective organized u could be an detective tooo.
by the rate ppl answer yer question, seems like all of us have read it.
Then tell him your not going to shoot him , just break up with him.
I guess this just isn't the place for that.
if she still goes all over him just let her know the peice of crap she is.
but she will not want to fall in love with them.
I even feel like I sort of know you now even.
Don't get in a serious relationship and just have fun.
he's a 13 yearold guy what am I supposed to get him????
Dont go back just 2 go back cuz u love him!!
don't go out of your way looking for something or constantly hound him about it.
WELL,FIRST FIND OUT WHY HER FIRST MARRAGE DINT WORK.WAS IT HER FAULT OR HIS.IF IT WAS HER FAULT!

He's and old man but hes only 20.
But if it is a part time job you don't care about, then why not?
And my buddy didn't kick my ass either because he was dating my sister.
stop focusing on looks and quit looking altogether.
tell him that and you will own him.
SNAP OUT OF IT join the rest of the world.
It was just what you envisioned.
FIRST TRY TO BREAK UP WITH HIM BUT NOT IN PERSON.
thats because most of them are pigs
people get married it is because they love each other very much.
if you are lonely then you have friends that you can have fun with.
Then both of you can move on.
considering there are only 49hrs left, most likely not.
where it can't really be anything more than jsut friends rofl
Of course, it does take two...
If he's not willing to try it then it's oretty much over...Sorry
Become rich, good looking, or famous.
if you two are really meant to be, you will end up marrying him.
She looks like an awesome person to go out with, how do you ask her out?
Us women really do want to get to know you good,shy guys :o)
to stop relations that happend before mirrage
sweetheart, you aren't tring to date the right girls, or should I say women.

Talk,get to know him and finaly ask him on a date!!
You seem like a sweet guy who only wants happiness.
Not if you were a smart cheater!
My boyfriend never gets me anything.
and u dont want that now do u.
Keep it all the way real!
take your bucket of worms and just go fish in another pond.
Some are because they have issues with men I am assuming.
that is just wrong plus shes older.
well technically you have not penetrated so no.
Tell him you now a lesbian.
if you want act sexy around him.
and if he says NO, kick him in the crotch anyways.
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT SOME WOMAN ARE SMARTER THAN MEN!
You are just gettting surounded by a lot of jerks!
You better keep your eyes open or Joe next store might steel your man...
If a girl fancies a guy she rubs or touches her neck frequently.
I could go on and on.
if you ponder this question more then twice in your life you r probably gay
Tell them you want to have sex with another, then your not cheating your truthing!
I get dumped for guys that won't do anything for a woman.
maybe because you havent found the right guy to respect you
I'm still in love with my ex eventhough she's a dirty biatch......
buy a car and go where the wind takes you.
Explain exactly what you want and what is going on.
*also very easy 2 get drunk*
u just keep silent like u dont knows she is existing
Any just don't replace cologne with soap
I dont think you should be worried.
Man are you gonna be sick.
and it won't cost you a dime.
I already messed up (bawled at a dance), and my mind was already screwed up for two weeks.

I have the same problem so if you get a good answer let me know uzedkarz2002@yahoo.com.
is he old and yer young?
Hope everything works out great for you!
i wouldn't try to find the right woman (guy in my case) becuase it'll just happen when it happens
It's just one of things you know...
and if its going to be a problem then just dont talk to him anymore.
then pray to you favorite deity.
it's tough... but you have to find it in yourself to go on.
LOVE LEADS TO SEX ....   sex without love is like having sex with an animal !
the key is to show that you are different!
LOVE YOURSELF AND DONT LET ANY MAN PUT U DOWN   ELIZA
It is a  cool thing to do!
go up and start talking to her
1st, that you both know, 2nd, she MAY know, and then third question you know she doesnt know.
If you really care about her, you will want her to be happy.
He should not cheat on you and he should not care about your weight at all.
and thought you should just introduce yourself!
just tell your family to give her a chance you love her thats all that matters right
and he can't just kick you out anyway?
I don't think he is totally straight if he enjoys watching stuff like that.
pray about it and you will get your answer,watch
;-)   Anyway,  lower back pain is a terrible thing.
ask her out if she says no try to move on
I have recurring dreams of my ex almost weekly.
I've known love from friends, guys, my moms,n family.
then when you feel the time is right ask her out
Then one day the guy turns everything around and says he loves me?
I waited until I was thirty, and guess what?
Make if funny if she says no, and i asure you shell end up saying yes.
and when they ask you if their ugly so no, tell them they are beautiful or something lol.
There's like 20 million women right here!
Hi, I agree....there's sure a lot of youngin's on this thing!
That means that u are on his mind all the time.
yet every once in awhile i will get like a crush on another guy.usually someone im around alot.
so try to do the second thing first, then if you can't do that first thing.
everytime your with her (almost all the time) shell be happy or smiling.
LOVE IS REALLY ALL THAT MATTERS.
Just tell, her that you wanna take her just as friends and no pun intended.
Ask ur wife to get on a webcam.
Hope you're in that same boat.
Becareful in who you fall in love with!
do u love this person deeply?
But they DO things that say 'I fancy you'.

And, of course, it always helps to have someone nice to start dating :)
no just cause hes good to your son does not mean hes good for you and to you
If you are not, you are just using him.
Personally I wouldn't worry about it.
Perhaps because many do not believe that they can.
I would not trade this man for anything I AM the luckiest woman on earth...

You dont Just get her to give it time Dog.
it does not matter if two guys or gurls care about each.
But if he just responsed bcos he's a polite man then it is ok, dont think too much.
introduce him to another girl, preferably one that 'likes' him, and then encourage their relationship to bloom.
if i was you i wouldn't do it.
Either he loves your or he doesn't.
Especially if you dont want to have sex.
IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU FEEL WHEN IT'S ALL OVER
Get his s/n....and send him messages every once in a while.
don't be cheap in first sight.....
Or what are you doing now that you were not doing then.
DO YOU GET BUTTERFLIES IN YOUR STOMACH EVERYTIME THE PERSON CALLS?
it seams you love him already so tell him according your heart voice.

If a certain subject always ends up w/ u closer physically they're playing u for a fool.
Shes the type of girl who is not good or doesn't even express how she feels.
I mean the list goes on and on.
I don't know but tell me when you find out
i thought he is looking for someone.
NOT AS LONG AS YOUR HAPPY AND YOU ARE DOING/GETING WHAT YOU WANT:)
But things that obviously bother her, I've stopped doing, and now she rarely gets jealous.
I tried it once but he immediately knew that was me :)
I asked a guy out and he said we would...sometime.
Is it just a want or is it really a NEED?
He does so much stuff 4 me.
if your husband or wife is cheating or hurting you are you suppose to just say with them?
I will tell you this though,..
e)It was like my body exploded!
any chat pro has such rooms
Women don't pay but men gladly do (enough to make it economically worthwhile at least)..
I want to smile and enjoy every minute..even during sad times...we'll keep our 'wits.'
I just want to know what you guys think of this.
GUYS: Would u consider buying your girl a ring with her birthstone or opt for a traditional diamond?
But I confess that the whole blog thing baffles me...
(i really hate smoking -- of any sort, and drinking)
if u dont wanna marry the guy let him go dont play with him.
the guys are notthe only ones that cheat.but people cheat because they are not happy.
girls get serious about it as long as they know ur serious.
i ask myself the same shit
Find some friends to hang out with and get her off your mind.
Nothing fancy ..Eat with your fingers kind of food...it's more fun
first of all why do you call yourself darkangle?
is there a problem with me.
front row  at  a concert (love  gun  by  kiss  has  a different  meaning  for  me )
Why do men do this you ask?
You love him and he loves you.
yes   2 years is no big deal
Angel honey give his ass the boot
BUT AGAIN I SAY DO NOT DO IT WAIT FOR MARRIAGE!
so nod and say ur right honey i never thought of it like that.
she calls you back when you call her (5).
But I want nice guys not complete jerks.
Even the perfect man, is not so perfect.
depends on wether ur choosin' the good guys or the player type.
best said in the movie old school Love its a mother fucker
She won't dare want to be with another if it is!
not all women think like this, just your woman.
no i won't, but somebody will...
someone i could look at forever...
And she should love you for that.
Bring it up like in bed during pillow time with each other
He would make us all look really bad ;)
I stopped that quick but he tells me not to worry and he stopped telling her he loved her.
No because your parents care about and don't want anything bad to happen to you
really, for better or worse was your vow.
He says i have bussniess trips everywhere lately.
WHY DO YOU NEED A MAN TO SPOIL YOU?
If he does, give it a try...go for it!!!
it's just asking to get hurt!!
does he tell other ppl when your not around?
ummm...what time of year is it?...do think he is SHOPPING???
i really like this guy, but i am trying to get over it and be a friend.
if he please to do all that it would without asking
it is natures free gift to all kind.
she shares her lunch (food) with you (9).
yup absoloutely ok as long as ya look carefully
But the truth is: I WANT ONE!!!
His excuse was that she was like his sister.
If you are a guy:  You are setting yourself up for failure.
as long as they are over 18.
guys don't like drama, and stuff like that.
the kid that they all ready have.
I LOVE HIM FOR JUST BEING HIMSELF.
and is it possible that he realy loves me?
theyn will always defend you no matter what.
Good luck and congrats on the 2 years
My boyfriend did stuff like that all the time.
If we guys could have MULTIPLE!
did i mention that he's hot?
i have the same problem with my mom right now but we are getting there.
Marriage is for life my friend!
YES, IT DOES IF ITS A GUY LIKE ME WITH A THICK 10INCH PENIS!!!
trouble related to love n relationship...
introducing bride and groom, cake cutting, dinner time, dances, etc.
i have the same problem with my mom right now but we are getting there.
Marriage is for life my friend!
YES, IT DOES IF ITS A GUY LIKE ME WITH A THICK 10INCH PENIS!!!
stay offline for goodness sake, if you think like that.
I  can't seem to just have a boyfriend I right away fall in love and scare them away
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD!
is to let them get it out, while you JUST LISTEN.
this is because LOVE IS BLIND.
No, this is NOT a joke!
a couple of tattoos are ok. certain peircings are hot.
I don't ever wish he would buy me flowers.
stop trying to get a date online & get off the computer!
Take out the trash, pick up your underwear, and say I LOVE YOU at least twice per day.
with a cucumber..and a shaving cream can
hand her you american express card
I think is to cut off the shit of getting hurt!
one with a hot body and a hot personality.
JUST CHICK HIM OUT..LIKE TRY TO HAVE HIS SCHEDULE.
Thats gettin kinda thin ice right there, with the touching.
He will probably go back there.
just be nice to him when you are telling him off.
Someone who is smart and funny.
It's just going to make them mad.
You CAN'T get a guy to like you, you don't have to.
Just dont hang out with them.
If you banged her mom or sister, you're not getting her back.
i don't know about girls in general, but i know i do.
So eather way, you shouldn't worry about it.
Because your boyfriend won't let you have one.
its you he should think is sexy.
TRY TO DO THINGS THAT WILL TAKE YOU'RE MIND OFF HIM.
it isn't just your perfection you have to cope with, its everybody elses).
But it's the normal looking people you should worry about.
seems kinda like a dumb question... if she didn't like you why would she let you kiss her?
Can't live ur life to please others.
I really like the guy, i would do anything for him just to be happy.
Because if girls don't feel an emotional connection with their lover, IT AINT HAPPENIN-- at all.
So you want one and don't want one?
IF HE WANT TO KEEP IT QUIET, IF SO NO HIS A-- IS UP TO NO GOOD.
i only have one friend thats a girl and ppl tell me thats not normal.
Any way if you truly love him you should trust him no matter what.
if they dont and be honest with u  u wont be able to take it
I beleive in Lust at first sight but love???
it actually depends on the girl.
you should always be who you are.
if your not comfortable with that then joke around(example) say wouldnt that be weird if we went out?
its like working out how do you get stronger?
life is a mix of good and bad, but it's not always 50/50.
Turn  on BC GRANT RD - go 1.0 mi  11.
Then tell her that just because you are apart that you can't still be friends.
And NEVER do anything you dont feel comfortable with.
yes.Try to bring a girl to orgasm.She wont leave you
Then, it's up to the guy to if he wants to.
If you have to ask...he doesn't..!
cuz maybe you're a good kisser and u don't kno it.
Anywhere the 2 of you want to.
if so he probly feels obligated.
How can I break up with him like that and he just spend $108 on my b-day gift?
get married.... no wait, then you'll never get laid!
If you're not married Break it off.
My thinking is that if you wonder if you are in love, you are not.
ill go to the first one!
spend more time with your wife.
love may be considered as first step to have sex  ...but there is also pure love without  sex
Don't do it no matter what she says!
No you stab at what you can get close to    Then you move in !!!
If life puts you down 7 times get up 8 times!
GOOD GIRLS WHO WANNA TRY SOMETHING NEW, LIKE LIVE ON THE WILD SIDE, GO FOR SO CALLED BAD BOYS!
yes this is normal..even some girls look at sexy girls too (but not all)
just on days that end in Y
And wants a family with me.
DO GET ANXIOUS WHEN YOU DON'T SEE THIS PERSON EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR A DAY?
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA ON ANY DAY!
Sure he'd find it weird but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have a positive outcome.
What type of party did u throw and does he like parties?
i  think  she  is tellin  you  to  smack dat  ass
every guy has a different fedish, some like ginger some like marry ann.
he probably feels like he needs some space, and asking him where he is going may make it worse.
you`ll only get hurt in the end.
Up to you but if I had it to do over I wouldn't.
I take it that you are trying to see if he would cheat on you..
I JUST DON'T THINK THERES HOPE.....
Maybe Phone-Sex with each other !!
Example: If your a shy male,it would be hard for you to ask some out.
Let her know just how much she really does mean to you.
my famile was cool with it, but i know there some familes that are not.
YES I HAVE AND IT WAS WORTH IT I FOUND A BETTER NEW PERSON THAT LOVES ME MORE
Whatever you do, do your best!
but other wise i agree with you completely.
try one with a special room or the empty side or outside.
I'm not being gross, do you see what I mean?
If it's warm enough find a lake that rents paddleboats (they're like 5 bucks an hour) and paddle around.
Report Abuse   Why do i want him back so bad?
Next get out there and have fun again...mingle discover new things...most important don't pretend and definitely laugh.
IF HE LOVES YOU THEN HE WILL WAIT FOR YOU!
that he is really not ready for you, and don't get hung up on him.
since she now has lost her vagina and has a penis, you'd have to look elsewhere.
break up with your parthern if it is your bf or just forget aout it and go on
i already gave him a nice card for xmas.
Just think a man that does all this and you're stil not happy?
Love the LORD JESUS CHRIST First .... then  HE will give you the best!
going somewhere that has a pool table!
You've never even seen a pic of her???
I just checked and they have versions of the song by
health or sickness, rich or poor, better or worse.
You know the old saying goes boys only want one thing so just wait.
If he's a nice guy then maybe things will work out this time!
no, it's not bad at all.
hello mate urs is the same problem as mine!!
only you can answer that question but it is not legal in some places
he says it bothers him too that guys leave me comments.
Well, I'm a young teen and I definatally do like girls that speak their mind.
no, it's not bad at all.

Being 'In Love' with someone does.
What if they wanted to wait for marriage?
My mom always said, Actions speak louder than words.
If you have to ask if it is LOVE then you don't have it, yet.
My girlfriend used to get jealous fairly often...
No if u dont want the kid use a condem
maybe you need to anser that question.
Say something creative like Hi, I am Joe Blow, how are you??
picture yourself telling someone that you love them.
But, REMEMBER, her ex was NOT a good man either...he cheated on her.
ask him if he likes guys
to me if a guy is shy a note showing intrist would be a good way to start.
My boyfriend does a lot of things that I don't approve of.
then tell them thay let you know.
if she thinks the guy is mature then she will admit she likes him.
I like one guy, I never talk to him.
all guys think about sex all the time.
this is why devorce is so high.
Hey, do you want to be my boyfriend?
Love is always free ......... and what is not free cannot be love(true love).
I like one guy, I never talk to him.
all guys think about sex all the time.
this is why devorce is so high.
Hey, do you want to be my boyfriend?
Love is always free ......... and what is not free cannot be love(true love).
was he like this before you married him?
Heck what will you do in your free time...LOL
Depends on the weather and where you live...
well when someone loves you they look for you.
If you meet a guy and have been hanging out for over month.
please send any help info that is available.
What so if she also loves u.
Whatever you do, don't let her go.
where can you get the wedding of your dreams donated, in whole or peices, without the media stuff?
if you are in love, your life's going to be hell!
You made a promise, doesn't that mean anything???
well you should talk to that persons best friend.
and its not this dick with legs.
would you love that person any less if that happened?
i dont won't to be nosisy.
But oh it was so much fun getting there, lol.
when you talk about other girls she gets mad (6).
i dont won't to be nosisy.
But oh it was so much fun getting there, lol.
My room, so I can watch.
when you talk about other girls she gets mad (6).
because it is a big deal to you.
then once you guys have started talking about the topic ask her if you would ever have a chance.
cause they love to have sex with someone new
It cuts both ways, I think.
When you don't like something do you say that it is gay?
Go out with somone else without telling anyone.
(short answer... ask him what he likes!)
I know my bf cares 4 me.
I know its the good ol' USA.
you guys flirt together(example tickling, play fighting, chasing eachother) (7).
when your ugly what do you have to lose.
Whey people don't like african girls?
You gotta feel out the situation though.
Man I totally sympathize with you.
Guys don't play games like you women.
but he's married, with three kids.
its hard but that will make you slip up and he will know.
im a women and i don't get it either
is it good to remain virgin for a boy till marriage?
tell him that u two can just be friends and maybe something will happen later
that should take all the stess off of you.
Best place to find a Date ........College  Best place to take someone on a Date Deffenetly not a club!!!
Just check the size of his balls honey....flat out say their looking smaller and watch his responce baby!
but just have a sence of style and hygene and you'll attract a guy
u just need to ask her frequently about what she feels for u !
easy just tell them or show dem how much u love dem
if he loves you he is gonna change his stupid crap.
At least that is what I find and I'm sure an average guy.
somehow i agree with them , because the nature gives her the role of feeding and protcting !
IF U WILL NOT DO IT SOMEONE SHOULD.
go to google and tipe in ecard then u can take it from there.
So how can I show her I care about her feelings?
Men do not like a weak woman.
Maybe you just have too many trixies in your life.
I know plenty of guys who don't like skinny women, i thihnk its just personal taste.
they can but it's not likely.
Don't think of it as spying....
He was what I breath and thought about 24/7.
if you want a life partner ther it matter.
spends less time with you always has an excuse to everything
on top of a 100 ft crane in a gravel pit during a storm... YAHOOOOOOOO
Then if they say maybe or yes ask her to do something.
does anyone know how i can talk my friend to stop stalking people he falls in love with ??
Obviously, if you're cheating on him, then you don't truly love him.
But I gotta admit it does seem stupid as I look back.
Someone who is not bitchy or conceited.
Go out to a club and ask some girls.
She could have a great mind but if she looks like a monkey then it just won't work out.
helllll naw....does he have a brother?
if you want a pertner to eat panipuri then it not.
i know it's corny but it's romantic.
Now you know what he's *really* like.
sex) he knows exactly what to say to get what he wants.
I Hopefully I helped you a little.
you take your wife for a reason right?
Ask him if he wants to be your boyfriend.
!no, i don't think its cuz ur a libra, cuz, i'm a sagitarious and i do have prob.
I mean it will be her ring so she should like it.
if he really likes he'll understand what you want too do.
But never push and worry and distress.
I dont care if they are popular.
(that may not be the best choice though)
no, you'd have been a prick had u said yes!!!
If it floats your boat go ahead.
opening doors is sweet but that cant run low.
You don't need friends to get yourself a girl.
because your getting old and they want u to be happy.
Girl, I've been there done that!
Surprise him once he comes home and take a wiff...
it means he is a real jerk
(Butterflies in the stomach... know what I mean?)
wELL IF YOU ASK MY TRUE THOUGHTS nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
if you dont you wont be together forever for sure.
IT DEPENDS IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
If you get some too (it doesn't mean you're crazy)  you will understand why she is like she is.
When you tell her you love her and you know without a doubt she loves you back!
Yeah, keep your mouth shut and leave this situation.
I say wait till your in your 30's.
YOU GO TO  HER.ITS VERYY SIMPLE
Jerk is only one of the items that make some men.
The one thing I've learned is don't force life.
yes it is a sin and it is illegal!
i`m not giving her any attention and she calms down herself
lol Just cuddle up behind her.
Guys look for a girl that is not retarded and looks pretty good.
I LEAVE NOTES TO TELL HER BUT SOMEONE WRITES BACK i DONT THINK ITS HER.
Because they are just soooooo darn sexy!!!!!!!!!!!!
relax... lots of woman have this problem.
ithink long hair makes guys look dirty and like girls
Unless you have alot of money then it might be 46.
Trust fund, yuppies, preppy girls all hang out in uptown.
90% of women do not orgasm by penetration alone.
If your man is cheating on you need to kick him to the curb RIGHT NOW!
My boy you asked a very good question!
#2 do u enjoy the doormat position?
Did you ask her why she did that?
never fight a man who is not afraid to die, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain.
if he is not eating, he if flirting.
suck it up talk to her and ask her out.
would you mind if you were/are married for your husband to have coffee with a married woman?
Sorry that it didn't work out.
a boy in my school and i have his pic and #.
A lot of people say yahoo chat.
you should ask her of she does or doesn't like ur last name and then take it from there!!
Ask your girlfriend because she obviously knows them best.
What, I'm trying to figure out is, is she playing with me or for real?
But i think it effect only if you want a LIFE PARTNER .
the only reason a person askes this question would to try and get some there selves.
not very expensive and you get a lot for your money
don't believe anything you see in a movie.
Don't do it ...  oh my God you will so regret it.
Baby Girl: A first love is a tough one.
how would you like it if she slept with one of your friends, right?
Ok, the last part may be overboard... :)
Am I being stupid or what?
n am not crazy at all.
thats why they say better or worse, not better or nothing.
Turn  on MANCHESTER EXPY - go 1.4 mi  4.
try talking to him on the phone when he aint around his friends or just ask him in person
Don't u have needs other than that.
Even thought they might not want a relationship; they figure they have a greater chance of getting some action
and go about your business like it was nothing.
i think you shouldn't, regardless of her age, both of you will regret it later.
You were not a prick, you were a gentleman!
NEXT TIME HE GOES ON A BUSINESS TRIP GO ALONG!
Flirt a little and ask her to go to the movies!
tell her you won't listen to her because she isn't treating you with respect.
yes, let him think he is macho.even if he isn't.
my friend told me he love me to but i dont know what to do
maybe both her birthstone and yours!
only i kno that he doesnt love me.
Most women don't want guys who are afraid of them, they want confident men.
You just said that he likes someone else.
i have said this already in many diffirent but similar ?
the new man in my life is great too, i don't know what my heart tells me anymore.
Good luck in finding your soul mate :)
Usually there not mad at u , she may be deppressed.
i don't know either;  it's like saying i'm throwing up when really it all goes down, not up
go to ebay...my friend's mom buys them on there all the time...you can get anything on ebay.
yes i'll do if i felt her need it .... satisfy her aften and she will enjoy u
tell him to stop chatting online so much and start working out.
find someone who is willing :)  then ask
do whatever comes from ur heart
if u two have a strong enough relationship outside of dating that is
I think that he is seeing another girl, but he is HOT!!
But I don't despair that much.
I'm guessing that she's around 50?
Be Honest, smilling, funny and gentleman ...
cherish true friends and love your boyfriend!
when she asks you to do something and you do it w/out complaining.
I only wish they were, then I would go after hime like a cat in heat!
So it is not just the guys.
its mean the one who needs it ,ie getting bored by the relationship
if he finds out uve been with another guy, he'll leave ur ass so fast ur head will spin
not my husband..but maybe someone elses.
he was fair and honest and didnt lead you on.
Be jerk back, and don't like him anymore!!!
You do know what a Houdini is, don't you?
if may seem that your using it to your benift.
Good Luck and go get em.
in family meeting i see her and i like her from the first look
You just have to STOP...no one can do it for you.
Dude, there are plenty - PLENTY of other girls out there.
I have, on more than one occasion...and I'm a dude!
I don't have that specific kind of fetish, exactly...
Another guy would not happen, lol.
Should I try and talk 2 him again?
they say that sex for woman , means family , love , safty !
Dont be afraid of embarassing your self.
d)I felt my whole body shake uncontrollably!
cheating is a fact opf life most women who blame men with cheating are the women who cheat
they want to fire down the sexual instinct
Admit all wrongs (even though you are not at fault).
Maybe she is not a girl?
please send any help info that is available.
its never too good to b either one of these.
if someone else is happy he will be happy.
Do whatever it takes to stay close emotionally!
she likes u...but she seems kinda immature.
but now i dont and he still likes me.... what do i do to not hurt him?
Whats the worst she could say?
as your exchanging phone numbers with her.
smile :) its the 2nd best thing you can do with your lips.........1st being kissing, of course
Ever heard the saying women need a reason guys just need a place?
!if he's looking at the net he's not looking at you anymore you should ask is that normal
IS THIS PERSON THE FIRST THING ON YOUR MIND WHEN YOU WAKE IN THE MORNING?
well i say u should still be friends but dont stay with him for a long time
if things were meant to be they will fall into there place.
it all depends on how turned on you are as to how wet you get
My mom chose a younger guy.
You shouldn't trust him if he's in a different area code.
But Im not sure what Im doing wrong.
WE BUY EACH OTHER STUFF AND LEAVE IT THERE UNTIL WE FIND IT.
you can still be his friend.
ok. Im not sure what u r talking about but my nick here is my email.
instead of agreeing you should be exicted.
try showing some signs of liking/attention, maybe he'll go for you or<(of course) maybe he wont!
You don't really ever get over it.
there's alot more ways, but i gotta go.
umm its someone u can be in the same room with for more than 10 min.
if so then id bet yes.
I just knew, not like that childish knew, but really knew..
Be shy, but speak ur mind wen u feel u should.
One of the most awesome guys I know has CP.
do you really want someone around you have to keep proving yourself to?
well i dont know what to tell u but there is a website below 4 u to try out
Nope, as long as you do it back.
you have to ask your self do i deserve better than this.
tell them how you feel about them
Don't give him a reason not to.
Well as a woman I would wonder what is wrong with a guy who didn't like sex.
Asian girls are like other girls.
no just kidding just dont answer it if you don't need to
Maybe u will even get one 4 Christmas!
Maybe thats why they come here....
That way you last longer :P
I know someone who is looking for work...Thanks!
Course I wouldn't date him cus he's like 30 years older than me, but yeah...
I mean look around outside it's everywhere
i really dont like to babysit on my days off!
If their is no reson for you wanting to leave!
to love & to be loved is the  greatest thing on this earth
You could always put the plane tickets in a huge box and wrap it ;)
Just dress really hot & go dancing at a night club with just your girl-friends.
Maybe they are not looking for a wife.
When you find the one that you just can't live without, her looks aren't going to matter.
ofcourse they are human too they are just into the same sex.
If your guy is cheating on you and you know it then break up with him.
If he says yes, you know.
because he dont like you, hes gay
Why do guys say they NEED sex?
Or think of it like this.
Don't try to be mean, be yourself.
have a 1st date at a cafe (lunch or coffee).
do you want to hang out sometime?
Just take your time because you have lots of it.
I just love a squirty lady!!
and if you love him so much what are you doing out with his cousins?
BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW WHAT THE GIRLS LIKE:)
Ya I am interested in this question too.
the woman who is now my wife.
I don't really want a relationship.
dont rush a kiss, the best 1s take time, trust me(bad experience).
Why can't your dad be friends with JEN?
personaly i dont know what to say when my bf complements me.
try to remeber why you got married in the first place.
I haven't been able to see her cuz, shes in NY and I'm in TN.
BE NICE, CONCERNED AND KEEP YOUR MIND ON SCHOOL AND FRIENDS.
ha ha, guys don't always wanna have sex.
go ahead and have sex- but use a condom.
I like geeks...they make more money and try harder (in all areas)
or he's telling you this to get in your panties if he hasn't already done so.
i would not try to talk to him anymore, it sounds like he just wanted to have sex
But once u start living together u tend 2 see ur partner often so gradually that LOVE declines
Try sitting her down, and try to talk about it with her*
Well if he is a friend you should be able to just ask him.
try to send her a love letter that expresses exactly how you feel about her?
HOW DO I KNOW ITS HER?
have you seen the movie A lot Like Love?
at a consert or any where where you need a lot of money
it just sounds like you're entering the friend's stage man...you dont want that do you?
i think a restrant would be great
But, I never saw my cousin again!
Oh, and one more thing:  don't ignore other guys while you're waiting for him to come around!
Ask him about it, If you thin he is lying, give him an ultimatum.
i don't think so if you like her then go out with her just with her dad's permission
Because mature woman are good companion.
Why not, its not like there is a 30 year difference, then it wouldn't be very smart.
A VERY CARING PERSON, WILL HELP ANYONE IF I CAN, BUT DON'T HURT THE PEOPLE I LOVE.
if he truly loves u he wont leave u!
Just what should he say ?
I'll just put it in a simple example...  MEN - 2 kinds of orgasms       a) Off the chain!
put your kids first every time
if u like my advice e-mail me at tech_boy001@yahoo.com
When you get married to them and you stay married until one or both of you dies.
Anyway... there are alot of girls out there, and we are all looking for different stuff in a guy.
im going there something like this now.
And what's not to be attracted to by that?
say that men like womens breast because when we started walking upright, it started to resemble the butt.
I know that there is nothing fair in Love and War ... but she is being ridiculous!!!
make friends with him/her and ask them out
Listen to DONALD D.........HE SOUNDS LIKE HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!
Soon u will find the right guy.
AND IT WILL KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET.
AND THEN BE A GOOD LIS-NER...
He might he that as fun.
just hang out with him and if hes nice 2 u or is staring at u he likes u
If not you just made her remember why she loves you in the first place.
it's not worth loseing a best friend over.
my husband is working in new jersey right now but ppl said hes married?
You see...She tells me she loves me.
I think some how some guys  are so week and aimless
Hmmm....I don't usually recommend asking right out.
spill a smoothie on his shoes..
Maybe she's in love with it.
So there really isn't any clear cut way of knowing.
she say very little just wondering why?
Love is love ... Live and let live.
i dont know why so it scares me.
even so its no good Men are always(almost) like that.
i would rather he had some meat on dem bones.
because you have to ask a question to get the answer!!
im in the same pickle tell me the awnser
if you or they have ever cheated on somewon dont bother.
find out if this guy still like you or not and then hook up with me at jellybreadkeisahhly@yahoo
Thanks for the comment on my question Poohjo :D  Love your enthusiasm also  ;)
if she smiles and hangs out with you you have only moved up.
if you truly love this person you will wait forever.. how ever long she/he wants you too..
they always want to be with you.
if    he really loves u then 'i love u' doesn't matter .
I think in most guys it is just a want.
No, b'cos that is what your heart desires
I fall in love with my husband again and again!
I even returned to the church begging god to give my wife back to me.
why r'nt u happy for u?
pair of kids, so its all good
On your wedding day you'll be so thankfull you waited and say WOW!
Just say your right to everything she says
AND BREAK DOWN THE WALL AND MAKE HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BEING NEAR YOU ..
Its like there addicited to it!!
Otherwise......life just isn't worth it...no matter how hard I work at it.
Second, just tell him you don't want to hang out with him.
oh you never should just agree a relationship, deep down you don't want it.
If we are crazy...so be it!!!
sorry but it is not your job.
I do and the more you speak your mind the more guys (like me) goes crazy
figure out if you are still in love with him, if youre not, try to get there again.
Holy crap... you've got to be kidding me.
i would dump him and find some one that really love you
WEll Im a girl so maybe i know your answer.
but always keep yo eye open holla!
Do you think he really loves me :)
im going out w/  my bestfriend (guy) and we bearly started.
Sure,but don' be discouraged.It happens to evreyone once in a while,just put it back in.
You don't want a man, you want a servant.
We argue alot about stupid stuff, but he treats my son like gold.
but in true love the concept is different and they will smile....and the go uhhhh!!!
sit down and give him a good talking to.
Now that said lets talk about the guy who left to think.
its like the air we breath.
just like throwing up it has to come up your throat to be able to go down!!
sure you will someday, when you are married.
someone you met at a bar - at least you know what he looks like
or blonds red heads lol  sorry
I know it depends on the woman!!
anything above two and half inch rocks!
Even if he does leave his wife and kids.
dump her ass if she is arrogant like that.
lust is when you are first with someone.
You want to be just friends too.
however, he is married and with a kid (she knows, kid doesn't).
(**  )<| Dead Fish Ollec, the Fish Slayer
Don't try to force yourself to like someone.
tell him to adopt a child for him self(i mean it in all honesty!)
How men get rid of clamydia?
Not one parent and a child.
Ask alot of Q's but also know when to keep your mouth shut and listen.
Ask just 2 people - her Father and your Boss.
what should i give him for xmas?
And, you can also ask her out.
your soulmate could be in europe.
I love peach fuzz on women.
(I hope I got that right)
IF NOT, STICK WITH YOUR PLANS.
I know a lot of people who are on their 2nd marriages that do that.
Soooo....yeah.......my little emotional overflow session here....lol.
If you don't like it, then it IS wrong.
So whats another way to know if she likes me or not?
Say your guy loves you first.
not often enough, too many other things going on.
I havn't had one yet,but I think just sit someplace and have your best bud perfrom
just have s3x a few, times, get married, then have sextuplets(6)
should i call him or what?
Don't degrade yourself this way...there are tons of sexy nice guys out there.
Only when we're not thinking about sex...oops!
when you are in a relationship and you are seriouse about it
the wedding/ marriage isn't just about her.
But man........that is too young to know what you want from a partner for life!!!
Act like your name Triple H
Not sure...wanna grab a drink later?
Well i would talk to the guy, there should be no MAKING HIM do anything.
He loved her so much he married her and had kids with her.
Hahaha, you sound like so many other single people I know.
haha-- mens are free for anything
me and my boyfriend are almost 3 months together is it okay to say that i love him already?
She laughs, we dream... and can't stop smiling.
Sounds nice, great concept, like wiping w/ 2 squares of paper, grossly innefective.
wut do u think i should do?
forget him, y would he live that relationship?
cause i cant message at school but i can do this.
he is most definitely cheating on you!
I like long hair on guys.
are you asking your boyfriend out or are you cheating on your boyfriend with some other guy?
so will he divorce with her?
You've got a set of balls on you!
girls dont really like fucking around with peoples hearts unless they get paid.
buy her flowers or something she wouldnt expect
you didn't marry his sister or his family and vice versa, you married HIM.
Should I try and talk 2 him in a different way and what should I say?
Ask him why dose he like you?
hmm it sounds like a test of your loyalty and all that bs.
That does mean that there not still in love with there 1st love.
If you mess it up,..no worries,..There is ALWAYS another guy (or girl for that matter).

if fate permits, things will change and you two will go further.
im 24 and my wife is 35.
get over it and get on with your life.
Pleaze dont push things 4 da both of u. let things go as they progress.
whats the point of going out or getting married after you'v been hert.
bon jovi-ill be there for you.
one for sure sign is if they leave to go to work and never come back...
IT CAN BE TOMMOROW OR IT CAN BE UR LAST DAY OF LIFE OR UR MARRIAGE DAY.
2) how she acts 3)who she hangs out with
3.He always thinks about his family and the only family i have is my mom  What should I do?
But my reward for hanging in there.....?
At one time she said she liked me alot but was going to go out w/ someone else.
if you like him after he treats you that way...then you are a masochist!
I just don't think most guys date with the initial intention of getting married, that just comes along later.
believe me i know i almost lost my finiacia' to a guy, and it hurts me till this day.
Guys (especially teenagers), pretty much only think about sex.
NO really does mean NO and whether U like it or not they RULE.
Can u tell me something abt u?
my man is in brooklyn new york.
You don't want to hurt her.
Well, it's pretty clear that you two aren't an item yet.
the shy girl because when you get to no them they wil talk to you.
they want to have stories made out of that... pure fun thing to them :)  but then who cares!
when we love a person, we want him/her to be happy.
thats the key, the rest will follow.
I dont want to have friends that hate me.
Depends what kind of ladies u want.
Guys usually don't play games, that's for women to do.
You need a guy that is going to love you for you.
when u make your mind think before ur heart
(he says it's harmless flirting) and calls him when she's having problems with her man.
if you have to ask this question leave or stay it means you should leave.
he and i are both very attractive and sucessful.
first, this is not something guys do it's something this one guy is doing.
then hell yeah it would be us but that's just it!
so if he wants to kiss then let him unless it makes you uncomfortable.
Then, find a great guy and have great sex!
try to see a girl that has alot in common w/ you.
First of all how old are you?
And I always thinkg she might find someone better too...
you go up to that person and ask them out.
I wake up several times and toss & turn... just never feel rested.
because girls have holes that we want to put it in.
if you have to be asking that question, then i don't think it is okay...
its always nice to exprience something even if its good or bad.
Think about your kids...you might end up with nothin in the end..period
If a relationship is heathly...Who should care?....Me, I am no one's judge!...But my own...I'm gay and I Rock!
And if he says no, then ask him out!
Some men look good bald too.
WAIT until you are 35.........that's when life gets good.
Once a cheater, always a cheater.
Txs Rngers say: cmon boyz, we got right on our side!
i noticed the girls do not just admit they like you, they give you signs.
Also watch MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING
Keep your chin up even though I know it's tough.
I know it sounds funny but if you really like this guy you should ask him.
when you can't stop to think about that person
try calling p-line i found one of my boyfriends there and well now we are just friends
Thos would defenitely help u dude!
Any place where u like to make love is heaven for u.
it is ok but you must be carefull cause there are freaks out there.
And it MUST be a 2 way street.
this dude wants to kiss me but he has a girlfriend what should i do?
How much younger...lol  Some women do.
I know most people who read this will think badly about me, but that's ok, I don't care.
If there is doubt then I would wait.
i think it really depends on what the female is looking for.
i think if you married someone- you should stay married unless one does something unthinkable, like cheating or abuse.
i guess it can be a resterant.
How to encourage a guy to ask me to go out?
if kids are involved though, gotta do whats best for them.
Women know it is far wiser to keep your mouth shut and let people make their own mistakes.
I try, i really do, but it still doesn't seem like we have a really good relationship... :(
Trust me she won't care after that.
Men do this sort of thing because they generally get away with it.
ima virgin so anything will help.
i have noticed that it depends on the girl.
If they all have their girls going then he has a girl going too, it's just not you.
b) I'm just glad I got one  WOMEN - ALOT!!
You cant let anyone persue you like that.
!also you need to take things slow if she wants you to.
I had four kids for him.
Men do that sort of thing because they can.
if u are in love just to hear i love u then  u r ot in love at all
i guess u just listen to what she has to say.
all good things to those who wait.
well if yall only been out 3 times i don't see how u can even love each other.
I wouldn't do him again, yuck!
Report Abuse   how old is everyone here??
LAUNDRY...... My God next question please.
Probably best if you just muster up the courage to tell him, though.
I don't like shareing my guys.
i've been with my bf for about a year now.
WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE EVERYTHING IN THE DAMN STORE.
most of the girls are just talk, and never follow through.
if your crush is married, i donno wat to do but if he is not, divorce your husband
I KNOW IT IS HARD BUT YOU WILL FIND THE RIGHT MAN SOMEDAY!
let him make the first move, if any?
I like her to but I dont wont to lose her as a friend if I ask her out.
check your wonderful abilities then trust your self and carry on
Ok I'm weird.....sex just doesn't feel as good if you aren't with the person you love.
everytime i do something nice for people i get slapped in the face basically
asians have money no doubt about it.
It always hurts to be rejected so there really isn't any way around it?
it is good to talk to a mature woman
BJ, then go bake him a pie.
If its meant to work out it will, so hang in there.
if not he might be obligated.
Washington DC - the ratio of men to women is huge
some have it as a laffy taffy  answ3r3r
We are funny about that stuff.
if its at school, you will find someone else, if is a friend in your circle then ask them.
it depend which country u belong?
it would depend on how the chat goes
I maybe 52 but I didn't start out that old!HA!HA!!
if you don't talk to her than yeah!!
If you get feelings then they are because of your lust.
now if she loves u and u love her then stay with her!
Just be the most what u realy r
wait til u get married, lol.
i hope everthing works out let me no chris_myhll@yahoo.com
You must be the GIANT of ur dreams brah, not the dwarf of ur fears.

dress sexy and then get naked
i have no ideas what to do !
why would they freak out if they are single it shouldnt be a problem
you are not wrong for not wanting a child just like he is not wrong for wanting one.
Just tell him to back off.
Being a guy, I can tell you that we don't do well reading signals or taking hints.
I dont know... do you ask him where he is going?
BUT this girl who likes him more than me is making him go out with her!
Only if you want it to.
First of all try gaining her father's trust
girl on girl kicks ass guy on guy is nasty
(Ladies and gentlemen answer me here i'm drowning!)
Umm...it takes me a while, 'k?
he wants whats his own baby.
just gotta have faith in another person
But it sounds like he wants his cake and wants to eat it to.
try watching the movie Hitch...you might get a few ideas...
we've tried yahoo personals, and chat rooms, gay bars, etc.
NO ... pheromones actually work on the person using the perfume/cologne.
LET HIM COME TO YOU HE DID IT WRONG NOT YOU.
but now i think he might be with this one girl - not that he has said so.
U can try it if u want, provided he still dont know who it was).
- satisfied customer is their best advertisement!
Makes me wonder if she is like 12 or something.
tell him whats on your mind.
not really, why are you even asking this question?
Next thing I know, he's kinda got a girlfriend.
go in for the quick swoop.
just be up front with him.
throw it away and even if you split up in the future never return to the porn.

Don't beg for their friendship either!
Well I hope this helps some....I know it helped me let go.
I WILL BE SO MUCH BETTER IF YOU TWO WAIT FOR MARRIAGE!
keep it going then ask for her phone number but in a way that not so formal.
If you banged her brother, you've got issues.
They got a divorce, the women re married a few years later.
thier not as scorned as you
only his boyfriend knows for sure...
1) first the guy is going to notice her body she needs to look SOMEWHAT good.
believe it or not, guys tend to daydream more than girls.
first of all if its a coworker, becareful.
exclusivity is a good indicator...when it's just the 2 of you dating each other and nobody else.
.when i call him back do i ask him if he likes me?
i love my boyfriend and he loves me.
If he is a guy, then he is cheating on you.
Why surprise her after you eat??
Show up naked and bring beer.
DONT WORRY U WILL MEET SOMEONE SOMEDAY .
try to fall in love with him again regardless of his stupid sister.
make it about her, not you & your sure to get a second date.
so if you have a gut doubt about it.
NEVER marry a man just for the kids sake.
look at the cars they drive.
Or if they call you just to say Hi.
some guys prefer more cushion for the pushin'!
Fore go tacky and cheesy pick up lines.
Why look at porn when you are just right there waiting in bed?
he will like you so much less when you do.
you just realized sooner as you get older how dumb it all is.
Like if you both like movies or things like that.
she does not act like her self!
if you want but i would wait and play it out.
beautiful it makes a girl feel special
U may have 2 just ask her why she dosent talk to u as much.
here's a good date idea, don't be cheap.
i also think its against the rules, in my college at least.
It makes it that much more precious when you DO say it!
men- sex men-power women-money ( theres always a gold digger out there )
a huge soft bed.... some place where you feel most comfortable and relaxed
i also prefer my guys big.
mabey thats what she means she wants a bad boy w/ roaming hands and rushing fingers.

JUST SAY WHAT IS ON YOUR MIND!
You gotta have trust in a relationship.
Some guys are just as afraid of rejection as girls are.
Is it wrong to laugh at a man when he says Men have needs???
maybe they  feel to  comfortable  around  you if i were single i wouold go for ya
but i like her very much...
ask him what his fantasy is.
Get some girls in your college.
does he say it only after you do?
B STRONG DO PUT A STOP 2 THE TORTURE OF A INNOCENT CHILD.
rub her shoulders if shes washing the dishes then jump in and help.
I gave him a big tip!
Goodness will boomerang back at ya'.
don't push him.......it'll only lead to resentment and he'll pull away faster than anything.
Maybe if there were only big women, this wouldn't be an issue and men wouldn't have a problem then.
Cooks a meal for you and it's not your anniversary or birthday.
hold her hand while your watching TV 2nite.
Or else you gave those vows for nothing.
(((((((((((((YOUR IN TRUE  LOVE LOVE))))))))))))) HOW YOU KNOW YOU FOUND IT?YOU DON'T!
I love him and I don't want this to come between us .
marriage is a sacred thing- and it's hard work, don't give up!
soon you 2 will be doing all kinds of things together.
I felt sorry for him, even though i know i shouldnt of.
I think he was kidding ;)
- now, always and forever and to stop asking.
well i can relate to that being a guy.
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL THEM SAVE YOURSELF THAT DRAMA LATER.
DONT LET HIM KISS YOU IN THE DARK.
I like guys with short hair.
so, dont put the blame on your boyfriend, its all about mother nature.
Mak him/her love u by being loveable :)
i think about 90% of them do.
well...im in high-school and have been for 2 years now, so ive learned alot!
I want the wedding of my dreams!
It soudns like she likes you already, so the hard part's over with.
why not the precious moments store?
Just because you two are best friends doesn't mean you guys are compatible for a relationship.
it's time to get some counseling.
buy them a pair of white socks!
Tell her That there is another great year with the woman of my dreams
make her jeleous, by flirting with her friends for instance!
yahoo chat is pretty good and it's free
They will come to realize how bad she really is (if she really is that bad) with time.
The one who never says 'NO'  ;)
I wouldn't think that just hers is such a nice idea.
is he trying to make me jealous?
wow... why did you limit that query to just 2005?
When you get married she should take YOUR Sir Name!!!
Just go up and tell her.
HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU, BE BETTER LOOKING AND TRY AGAIN
when she talks, listen in that way you will know whats bugging her.
Sometime you strike out, but most of the time,... it works out.
because he would never expect it, take the load off him and surprise the hell outta him...goodluck
Just think of this.... What if your mother chose to have an abortion when she was pregnant with you??!
Dont kill me before I finish...LOL.
If I want them I buy them myself or ask him to pick them up for me.
sounds like you two are just in a rut.
but i think, in most western countries the virginity issue is no big deal.
When you find him...ask if he has a brother (haha)
If she says no then ask to be just friends.
stop bing so nosey.... usually nosey people find things they dont want to find...
Not just to please your boyfriend.
unlimited music download membership for 1 year
they will never talk behind you back.
It's like a nobody going to tell me who I am thing.
should i stay, endure it and try to work it out?
does often tell you that you are the guy of her life does she play interesting games with you
And I have a camera phone she does too.
You don't have tell her right off the bat.
Guys think with there minds and women think with their emotions.
you should tell him how u feel and if he loves you he will understand
Am I loosing my best friend?
is he really abusive or are you making this up?
to me that would be the most meaningful sweetest thing a woman could ever do!
firs of all it depends on how old u are!
Girls like that will rub there crotch anywhere.
dont cheat, but especially not with her friend!
i mean what is the worse that he can say right?
if you love eachother you will find ways to make it work.
I think thats ur problem tofigure out no offense....
some females do that, make it on you to leave.
he needs new friends if there that immature
But after reading wat u mentioned in 360 blog i think there is something which is seriously wrong...
And if you love something you always go back.
If he is smiling really weird and is asking stupid questions and he is staring at you
Let's see...if you really hate her, she probably already knows.
i've seen some cases where they loved each other since they were 5 and got married.
get out there and be yourself!
I always find out, its like I sense it.
dont say it before you get to affectionate.
But like if u over 30 dats stragiht.
Lots of nice, intelligent girls... ;)
Don't see him one last time.
get freaky nasty     get down n dirty  do every thing and any thin you only have one first time
Yes:  Don't sunburn your back on your honeymoon!
we can't choose who we love only what we do.
i dont know him butim guessing.
even though it's olny 2 yrs.
But, women are just better in hiding, and lying.
to have loved and lost...because u learned from experiences or [[mistakes]]..
maybe she's scared of commitment  does she go around and flirt with other guys???
Don't worry if women need you or not.
Or cyber online and all that kinda stuff !
i got to end it but i cant.i need to know how!!!!!
hard but true, maybe she does not love u. right?
SPUNKY MOST OF THE TIME HAPPY AND LOOKING ON THE BRIGHT SIDE AND SOME TIMES A LITTLE WILD
say are you doing anything some night & ask her to a movie.
i dunno u n i havent met u .
yes us  girls really do want sex as much as you guys do.
Don't worry, you are only 15 and there are many other girls out there for you.
simply buy her something she wants for a long time...she'll definately chill down
i think the modern life and society demands us to pretend that women are the same with men
she just wants a good grade, forget about it you geezar
i would watch out and not have a real relationship with this person.
by fame and never be disappointment then remember that failure is the first step to succeed
If you really dig her ask her out but no sex.
old guys young guys, it doesnt matter.
o theres hope a lot of hope trust me
yes because we need to get to know people
depends if you can find anothr queer near buy
Surprise her with flowers...forget the sex.
Maybe she thinks u r some kind a virus or 3.
I THINK THERE IS MORE INTEMACYWITH A PERSON YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH.
Most boys wonder what are girls good for anyway?
Because they are just so interesting.
I love love love silver, blue, black, and sage green... but I'd say that I like BLUE the best
we dont have to work as hard b/c dudes are easy prey
HE WILL SNEEK THE KISS IN SOON ENOUGH AND YOU WONT HAVE TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.
Shes says it has nothing to do with me, she just has not sex drive.
lol, I'm with Wendy on that one.
If you know what I mean.
above all he has to be interested in alot of stuff I am.
But dont worry.. there will be other guys for you to like.
not too long like to ur shoulders though.
Guys just have urges when they're around pretty girls.
to make a friend, be a friend...to make a spouse, be a spouse!
if you ain't getting none, then start masterbating
be there for the person, help out, be a friend.
But if you want to kiss him,..just lay it on him!
I personally think that's so lame.
Just tell him its your first kiss.
if i found it a real so i don't have to find it again
you want to be able to play.
its really impossible if they care about you.
If you obesess over them, or die at a young age...
3-4 times a week at least.
So take it slow and take care
I say just leave it alone.
heres the deal, theres love and lust.
Oh there are so many questions that need to be addressed long before you say I DO.
Are they the bad girls, just like how some girls like the bad guys?
its like getting drunk u cant feel anythin at that moment but when u wake up u feel everything
wE HAVE STUFF IN COMMON BUT WE FIGHT ALL THE TIME TO EVEN NOTICE WE ALSO BECAME FRIENDS.
do your thing too though, dont just stay home and get so mad that you want a divorce.
asking u out may seem risky because he doesnt know u like him back.
Stop and think did you ever give him the idea that he does own you?
How much do you like the guy?
Guys are jerks when they try to be nice.
i believe he truly loves me with everything he has, and he's still around.
Do u believe in love at first sight?
Why doesn't your mom tell your dad who her friend is and be open about their lives?
Yes of course it's normal to have guy friends if ur a gurl
u should look at the girls around u even far away from u at all times.
no he is just a player that all.
hes great, kind, considerate, gentle, yet hard, and tough, caring, lovable etc.
it just means that when you do, that person will get the best of you.
if so, how much celebration does it warrant?
dude, i'm 21... and i once went out with a chick who was 17.... it's all good.
Sex as a weapon is just stupid.
However, that does not mean you dont have a chance with them.
so is he trying to make me jealous or is he just a player?
once in a while, and as long as it isnt a constant thing.)
better do not dare..it is not a good chance  why is he/ she old?
if she cant help but go after other guys then forget her(that happens at any age).
it's how you get a job, dumb ass !
anyway, he may be saying it because he means it.
in my opion it is better to not get involved with someone who is married.
And trust me if he did all this, he would not be faithful.
you don't really like him like that.
I spent $65 4 Christmas on him.
so my advice would be to quit being so shy!
she has been talking on the phone to a guy she met online/but not in person!
Believe me he likes that Big Butt!
I don't feel the same way about her as I used to, but I stilll like her a lot.
if your intimidated she will know.
If she's like that you can take her to a perk.
it depends how how much younger
are you a compleat prude or any thing?
through my ups and my downs and he still doesnt leave me at all.
And you dont deserve this kind of man.
go to an interview with playboy or sumthing
Such a bad idea if you decide to hook up with her.

If your husband didn't want you he wouldn't have married you.
!im 14 seeking for lots of advice.
she invites you to go places with her (10).
u should also ask- how do i prevent STDs?
you should be glad you got a second chance of being with someone.

unless u know what she feels theres no question of understanding her.
it always makes both of you feel so much better (even if you have had an disagreement.)
Guys arent complicated like girls are.
Judas Priest Turbo Lover, has the groove & rythym  just for the occasion
LET'S SEE UMMMMMMM THIS IS A HARD 1 I BELIEVE BOTH BECUZ  I CAN'T PICK SIDES
i would just be totally natural about it.
NO ONE DESERVES 2 B ABUSED IN ANYWAY...NO ONE!!!
I try and manipulate people to get what I want.
Just want to see what other people out there like.
Love isn't something that is, just beacuse it once was.
Guys are feeding you a line.
anything else you just stumble upon is lust.
BECAUSE WOMEN THESE DAYS DONT CARE IF SOMEONE IS MARRIED OR NOT.
If you're a good girlfriend for him, then you wouldn't be worried about cheating.
Wonder what white gals like about asian guys?
if she loves you or really wants to be wit u, she will deal with it!!!
trust me its good to have experience, especially if the other girl has some.
AS LONG AS THE KEY'S ARE NOT STICKY.
I MET HIM AT A SPEEDWAY GAS STATION WHERE I WAS WORKING...5YRS, LATER WE'RE STILL MARRIED WITH 4 CHILDREN!!
Choose one thing that you know drives her absolutely crazy and she always gets on your case about.
At least they can drink (I guess!)
i think its because girls judge ppl by their appearence.
Beware and wait this one out.
secondly why would she hate you for moving?
no it is not a sin.
if he gets another girl to give him what he needs.
yep it doesnt mater where you meet people you always have to be careful
Don't be so hard on yourself!
there is a reason he/she doesn't want you anymore.
true love finds you you dont find true love.
becuz there annoying and usually sit on the couch and do nothing all day and they eat 2 much
dont give in too the divorce temptations.
my father died 2 years ago from a cancer that starts with an m i dont remember the name

Read He's Just Not Into Me!!
just get annoyed or freaked out.
because youare just talking to her then you are just being friendly then.
i am gay and think i love him but only a month now.

Guys think about the following things about girls:: 1.
moms' always thinks they know whats best, for and they are usually right.

Well you said that you don't feel the same way as you used to.
Rudha, i would like to know abt u a bit.
Start the conversation with the obvious ... tell her you like the fact that she always smiles!
But guys don't intend it that way at all.
Or... wait while some1 else does it before u.
question is not complete, u must mention the type of girls
Then you're just a bad memory.
Sex is for the marriage bed only!
- old habits are hard to break.
I have alot of favorite colors but the one i like the most is blue
though we live together i find that we don't get much time alone.
if in doubt talk to her Drs.
i would think it to be more special that way!
How old are you, are you totally clueless?
If a guy cheats, he's a dog.
THE AGED OLD SAYING NATURE KNOWS.
I see ppl mess up everyday  or make love mistakes everyday.
the problem is you can't....but if he really cared about you he'd have more than sex on his mind!
Even if you didn't do anything wrong!
Happy folks get on with life.
He may finally say all right I trust you so stop following me!
And One Time At Band Camp
There really is not any best age to get married.
I have been married 11 years and I tell you I fall in love with him over and over!!
Oh yeah by the looks of your picture who would want you anyway...sicko!
Dude have you seen 40 yrs old virgin???
Don't force yourself to try it.
Your heart will tell you if you are in love!
why would you go into something you've got no experience in?
But I miss her every day.
she might just have the expereince your looking for
Love its that gut feeling you get.
put it up for adoption after it's born if you want, but DON'T KILL IT.
i wanna no if i fit in.
I like men my height or taller.
and it also depends and how the guy acts.
he will try to have sex with you
I would have been a kid longer !
but maybe they will come back to your question to see who else has answered.
At least that's what I've heard.
No; however, YES, if his dongg isn't at least xxxx miles long!
My ex is a crazy byoch!
I sure you will have lots of luck.
and why would you even want someone that would cheat on his wife.
well... depends of how much you would like to invest in one...
!There is nothin sexy about nasty old blood comin out of a kootch!!!
You might wanna listen to the lady if you are not playing pranks :-)
See how he looks at you girl.
Be totally casual...you know..Hey there's this restaurant I've wanted to try for the longest time!!
She will worship you in return ...isss thaaat soooo baddd??
i fell sorry for the women that you run into.
due to the way they get the diamonds.
WHy don't u ask her what she'd want or for her to make a list for you.
because women deal more with emotions, then men do.
Obviously show him a little boob,Just kidding thats if you want that kind of guy.
like tell me is they mean, flirty.
Step Four: Get to know HER!
be the fun girl he knew once upon a time.
but  here it gooes did it hurt .then they said what ?
But if you are in love and the other person feels that same way it'd probably feel good, right?
Not sure what her rule should be!
I am more of an orange or camo turned on guy!
here mine are warm) how does he react when the subject of who likes who comes up?
Honey those days are long gone!
mostly it depends on : SEX , PAST , etc .
sure, what do you have to lose?
She wa svery glad i told her and she was mad at her hubby.
STAYING INSIDE OR SLEEPING ONLY MAKES IT WORSE TO RECOVER.
If you really want to know... ask HIM.
Don't try to talk about it with him, just see how things unfold.
Find another guy for your sexual needs :-) Not everyone is good at everything...
a good movie to see with on a date?
it's just like any thing else such as broccolli,liver,cheese.
In slot machine, if you get 777, that means you get a Jackpot!
go do something all together thats fun, and maybe she'll relize that she needs to get out more.
I even asked her why and she couldn't give me a straight answer.
we can chat on yahoo      mikegoti1972@yahoo.ca
are you really looking at the big picture!
Was I too soon, she seems ok with the term.
I THINK IT DEPENDS HOW THIS COUSIN IS RELATED TO YOU.
some prefer the bad boy, while others look for a guy who is gonna lavish them will gifts.
only if the girl is not my daughter, and i'm the lucky old man ;)
dear god thats cofusing just tell him what happoned and apologize........
WHO SAID AMERICANS ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE GIRLFRIENDS?
God did such an awsome job making women and now everyone wants one
Their shape, softness, the nipple EVERYTHING!
that isnt to say looks arent important.
How do you know its them?
9 out of 10 chances they are seeing someone else, therefore making them cheaters!
It was like looking at Tommy Lasorda.
they will usually go for the money
I don't want to be caught.
just like me, they long to be, close to you
Black men like big butts and breasts even if the woman is fat.
is ruff sex a bad thing?
Dont let him get to you.
you sometimes don't don't want to believe the feeling because you have gotten comfortable with that person.
MO money Mo money Mo money...
Grow up...become an automous WOMAN...and then go out and CHOOSE a MAN of integrity who will RESPECT you!
thats the same question that i asked for years.
I say STOP spoiling her so much- she is getting to comfy living with a guy and dating you.
so your just the backup boyfriend just end the friendship your getting played
remember there is no shame in waiting.
Men who love their women do not do things to make them insecure in any way.
I lost my virginity at 17 and drunk....
BE YOURSELF THAT'S WHAT I LIKE I GUY WHO CAN JUST BE HIMSELF.
Now days more women are with men who don't want to work and do whats right.
Depends what you use it for.
Don't think another thing about it, hun.
it doesn't matter that she's black, a girl is a girl!!
He says What when you ask him.
well  you  should  just  forget that  you are  doing it.
Everyone reacts differently...just have patience and be there for him.
NO i love to kiss girls and what does that have to do with pets?
you know for sure when you don't doubt.
not to sound mean but why do u care?
funny, kind, strong, common sense, and well what the women has as her strength.
dont get married until your finacaly stable.
amorous<--- i think that is how it is spelled.
and if he really loves you he or she will wait!
(I ran from this guy since all he wanted wasn't what I was giving)
i think what you should do is to act like if you r not feeling her anymore.
So go out there and live!
Sometimes no strings can be fun...just be careful & protect yourself...
some girls are more interested in somebody with money instead of making it themselves
Sounds a lot like my 10th grade year.
but they are still dating and still living together.
But don't cheat, it makes you a really really lame person, a weak person, an amateur.
Maybe a candle lit dinner with a teddy on.. who know's... GOOD LUCK  :)
well does age have something to do with it??
I am definitely not trying to say thay can't help themselves...
Probably not, but it could work....no probably not.
should i or should i not?
you really should be asking why people in general cheat, not just wives.
That actually worked for me once.
No, they could have just not found the right person.
Same as all women are looking for in men: Security
I find it 'ONE of the best books I've ever read'!!!!
Some men prefer bigger some man smaller breasts...
do the rings bearers walk before the flower girls?
IT USUALLY HAS A GOOD OUTCOME UNLESS SHES STUPID ENOUGH TO THINK UR SPYING ON HER.
at first sight it might be lust.
tell a friend to ask him or her
stalk him/her, they'll get freaked out on put a restrianign order on you.
did someone tease at school etc.
only money not even sex just $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
you should go watch it with your date it might be a little long though
It means a lot that people still care.
I don't mean by buying her things......I mean by a gentle touch.
Um i would just to be nice..
no... obviously you know she has a b/f.
If he does and he lloves his little girl stay.
show her how to eat properly and encourage her each day.
I hated my life after that.
One of my friends did it, and she says she didn't make it happen, it just did.
talk to her about it - try to be as calm as you can to start out.
Girls like lots of things silly.
Find couples to hang out with!
and is my best friend for more than 1 year
If you have to ask questions like this about your relationship.
No guarantee tho, because some men never grow up.
If he were any kind of man he would not be married and dating you!
Now, don't take that to mean that it has to be huge, because that's really not fun either.
Flirt with her till she knows it.
I know i definately would want to know.
Definately ur relationship is some wat different .
IT IS UP TO YOU TO LEAVE OR STAY.
be happy with each other and enjoy life.
dont make it a racial thing.
why have a wedding if its gonna suck, you might as well just elope.
no you dont ,but you will need a lawyer for each state
they might not be the crazy one look inwards
NOW YOU TELL ME - What does that tell you?
Just because you look it doesn't mean you want to buy.
man just get over it... you will get mates not a mate...
LET HIS NAME AND LOCATION BE KNOWN TO THE WORLD!
no if you try your an idiot
naked pictures... or jumping up and down naked... both work..
so be honest..talk it out and be willin to try new things.
^ I agree lol thats funny
hit me up if you got a question i got an answer luv yah chausss
it depends are u two in a realtionship???
and you better check her ringfinger boy!
its better but it can be more painful.
If you're hiding stuff, you're probably cheating.
Both need to be good to go!
If he's bigger than you and has a bad temper you should be.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW RIGHT NOW, that they are wrong.
love for yourself....all else is secondary
just curiousty,what about Hilary his wife?
cds  shirts  dvds  an iou for a movie or something, your treat
We fight about it and he still dont care.
And when you decide to leave her alone she gets even more upset???
Butt out and get a life
Your the one she PROMISED her love to.
It depends on your preferences...  :)
If you are a chick, then give lots of tongue.
ioono but i kno i dont want no unattractive(ugly) boyfreind
You only 'kinda like' this guy, dont take the risk.
I masterb*te almost 10-12X a day.
always behave in ur nature and ur honesty and u'll get them
Same goes with IM, do not archive your messages.
Or else he will never know that you have a problem!
coz 2 stupid makes no difference
What the hell am i suppose to do???
AND SO WE COULD SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
in general..white men prefer smaller women..hence the asians they like,too.
You should say, He's not in my life anymore, so quit asking me stupid questions!
plus you might be able to get some some on the side, you know what i mean right!!!
do you know about his past?
i use myspace and xanga check out my myspace n xanga!
honestly i think you should just out and out tell him.
im always the one to attack him i want to be attacked.
But of course.. that's just me.
it means sad......ur having a sad christmas.....ur lonley
But I notice once I pass the size 10, only black men look at me.
I not weird, I special :-) Why do we park on a driveway, yet drive on a parkway??
your thinkin about doin it , huh.
or is your family trying to save you from making a mistake!!
nah... you 2 have your own lives to go though he has his things to do u have yours.
But im spending almost all my time out there.
not really but if they mean it they would never do anything to hurt you
there horny people alot of thhem arent though alot of them are sexi and fun
it comes natural unless she is tryin way to hard to get your attention
You don't mess with chics like that.
Life is a one-way street, and, gee!
big, small, lopsided, perky, it dosn't matter.
yes it happpened to a good friend of mine he is now happely married with to great kids
you have to get past him just looking good!
a nice guy that does not care about what girls like.
of course u can, love what should to love, hate what sould to hate.
I do at least three times a day
Long winded way of saying: Chill.
with an transplant of hear full of love.
Others would find blonds, readheads or even grey hair sexy.
Just put them all together n you got the perfect girl!
sometimes no means yes, and yes means no.
Honey, I thought told you to wait in the truck!
Their shape, softness, the nipple EVERYTHING!
so technically...the question shouldve been Y R GUYS SO STUPID AND SLOW!
So why do you guys think this happens?
I guess I'm going to go to hell when I die.
It really sucks actually, cuz your like damn I screwed it up.
but it does sound like cheating.
Make compliments... Talk about what you are interested in...
slap him in the face and remind him who he is
Using lube will help a lot too.
It really sucks actually, cuz your like damn I screwed it up.

I told Darryl but he's willing to take me back...
go out and meet a beautiful girl.
BECAUSE THERE IS NOT GOD IN THE RELATIONSHIP
depends who she is, cuz alot of the time its not worth it.
Or how do I find out?
yell at him in front of a nun, because that would just be rude...
These things sound like it'll make your reunion that much sweeter!
DUH YU BOTH LIKE EACH OTHER BUT YU EITHER OF YU DONT WANT TO ADMIT IT
Just call her and take a chance.
you should try and use a phone.
be romantic but dont be tuchy feely, make sure that she is comfortable with it.
ANY advice or ideas on what is going on??
Looks alone will not do it.
If they don't like how he looks or where he lives, then too bad.
every one in my high school had one, it shouldn't be so hard if you are good looking
THERE ARE FEELINGS THAT WE HAVE WHEN INFATUATED, THAT WE DON'T HAVE WHEN WE ARE IN LOVE.
good luck buddy.. but take a long time..
They want something easy or they are sluts.
I think all in favor of females always have it on their mind!!
But, I guess you knew that.
if u love him then no
Yeah, You just have to have a lot of money!
And i love it, dont get me wrong, i love every second of it.
If you want to marry him.
Oct. 16 1996, and they have 3 little girls!!
Dude you sound so wishy washy.
Or is he cheating on you, or stealing money from you.
Its been my experience that most men set there sights to high.
EYE CONTACT IS THE MAY KEY
If you are serious about her, dont let your guy friends mess things up between you!
Just kiss her in front of people.
I like the medium ones :)
that person wont judge you no matter what you do.
He was 19 and she was a 29-yr-old divorcee with 3 kids!
he stood me up for two hours and its not the first time
A lot of humour and crayons.
im with bruce on this nye tends to bring out the slut in us
Obviously it didn't start out like this, otherwise you wouldn't be with that person.
So, you should be happy to be so.
Good thing: They listen to what you say.
With that in mind....GO FOR IT!
The one you truly love -> you can't miss that feeling.
I had a problem like that no to long ago.
maybe because birds are afraid of getting close to people ...
yes and no see prostitutes do it for money and some have children and need the money.
start being nice to her return everything that hers  and keep talking  to her
i'm 11 and i wouldn't mind going out with 2D though hehe
I mean, am I just a booty call?
and tell a neighbor whats going on.
i reccommend using lube, even if you are wet for the first time just to make it easier.
take it easy for the first time.
(please exuse my spelling, i suck w/ it)
You definitely want to avoid comparing him to them (Bob always did this or Jim never did that).
Show her love during the day.
if it is ruining ur life, u should talk to her.
they suck, but so do STD's.
Ideas: -ipod -sweater shrug (very hot right now) -pink moto razr cell phone -concert tickets -romantic weekend -bird feeder
But ask her, not us, ok?
IT SOUNDS HARSH AND HOPELESS BUT YOU GOTTA TRY AND TRY AGAIN.
only u can answer this question....... my gf was a senior and i was a soph.. when she graduated.
Oh, and a guy whos cooks is great, too!
So i told his wife  right after he tried.
Yeah, if you're stuck on getting with her.
If you like giving that person what they need/want... That is a good start for some quality lovin'...
Therefor you love her too, don't cha?
find someone single and tell the cheater bye
Most caucasion men don't like fat women.
LOVE IS PROOF  THAT GOD IS WITH US  IN THIS DARK WORLD.
Now, if this is the guy asking this question, then you have issues.
YOU KNOW LOVE ESPICALLY YOUR OWN BUT TO DETERMINE THE OTHER PERSON LOVE FOR YOU IS THE HARD PART

(a video tape of you confessing your love, singing....
Does he always seem happy to see you?
you guys could go out as friend to like a movie or something fun.
also, i dont think you should let her know you asked this question bout' her on the computer.
And the gal always think the guy is infactuated towards her !
I am not so sure why I dont like it.
the real question is if he really loves you?
I see lots of guys anytime I leave my house.
age is just a number and if she is mature enough, overall its her descision as a legal adult!
I mean if its the second date I suggest u dump him.
it's not what you buy, but what you give.
you have to atleast be able to feel it, or even find it!
yea i think you should ask her.
When you just like someone and dont even think why because you just do...
And nice teeth, gotta have 'em all and WHITE!
He's like one of the best guys ever.
who has a good head on his shoulders.
try aa  if you cant get him sober get awy from him  hell destory you
Maybe you havent found your true love!
Gosh, what does she like to do?
im sure you will like it there.
Drop em both and find some folks to hang with who aren't so confused!
something had to make that relationship that bad
i say you should talk to him.
And you just want to be friends.
Well good luck with the ladies!
girls like lots of stuff, but you have to be more specific.
Good luck and dont forget to Strut!
Hard to get mad at your your own team mate..Lol.
We just have to except it and move on.
Oh - anyone would be so lucky to get that!!!
I GUESS IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR DESIRE TO FIND A SOULMATE

And ofcors, most important thing is brain...
MOST WOMEN LIE ABOUT HOW MANY GUYS THEY'VE SLEPT WITH.
Jealousy mostly, but it really is his problem not yours.
but some do it because they feel they need to rule you.
being lovely from all people like how i love him
Well the NO is already there because you are not with him.
Now go see a psychologist before i slap you.
I've heard some women say that their first time didn't hurt (or maybe not so much).
Read Sex for Dummies by Dr. Ruth!
well u could still be lovers n be friends.
If she loves you and you love her...then no worries!
I dunno, probably because it keeps the human race alive.
i dont think its alright to get friendly you never know when  he might get in love with her.
Either they do or they don't.
Or she'll be surprised and responde to u.
i tink its not important becoz, in a relationship..u need a personality and the attitude that is really attractive...
things like that should be a clear sign of how he feels about you =)
tell your mom that you dont like her family.
Because its a part of life...
LOOK THEM IN THE EYES AND IF THEY START TO SMILE THAY ARE LYING
try impressing me with your other end!
Even if you're just friends with someone, go out.
SO CHOOSSE YOUR PARENTS TO BE YOUR BESSTEST FRIEND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
If she doesn't like you, it's NOT PERSONAL!!
If you guys are friends, then you can definitely send her a card.
Go to clubs -- Line dancing, karaoke, sports bars, comedian night, etc.
Go out with my friends and flaunt what I got.
just say do you like me or her
Didnt you get hurt when you fell from Heaven......
I don't think it's too soon.
you just don't know what their responce is going to be.
but i have never heard of reduction.
everything that happens has a cause, find out what the cause is and fix it
if gal is sweet, slim, cute sort of average breasts are far enough.
I will miss him terribly, by the way!
They fell for the wrong guy.
I wear mine on my ring finger because it means more!!!
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE CEMICAL AND A EASY FIX.
He said Oh that's wonderful we're going to drink champagne tonight!
Have you ever seen skid marks in your own pants?
What ever you do...don't be drunk when or if you decide to have sex.
Just don't get her any that she is allergic to and you will be o.k.
ask him to his face... live your life
when u see anything familiar and widespread do u'll do it without fearing
search better... and low your aspectations..
What can I say, I'm a catch!

At 50, a 32 year old.
...guys in their late 30s/early 40s...
Yahoo is one of them !
Im pretty sure it doesn't mean anything.
tell her the truth...she may understand,i mean shes your best friend...
But if you think it's REALLY serious then you have to trust him that he won't be hurt.
It's like telling them that they can't go shopping on Wednesdays.
Not like a old maid either.
if he does then size won`t matter.
and if he tells you what hes doing .. is he lying to you???
cheap and good is the best way to go.
if you think your ever gonna find someone who is equaly mature as you your nuts.
how long has it been since u guys haven't talked if long then just move on.
I know because something  like that happened to me to !!
go down on her or use your fingers softly
their waiting 4 him to die,get his money and find a younger man?
yes, you can too me its personaly natural i'am mean whats a relationship with out any hatred in it
it ain't the size of the wave, it's the motion of the ocean!
that is what it turns me most.
If you really like him then you should be like dude I like you and say me or her.
What if he asks questions ?
why would they admit they're cheating if they're getting away with it.
(i.e lots of hugs or geez your hands are cold.
If that doesn't work he is gay
it's not that women like the taste of sperm, it's to please their partner.
(its been a year now) I'm lucky to make love once a month.
All I can say is good luck!
He wants me to be super-aggressive & it's just not my thing.
guys don't always think a bout sex 24/7.
1st time shame on him 2nd time shame on you 3rd time your a damn fool
well first just go up to her and ask her how she is doing.
Funny thing is I realized that the other guy I loved more.
I won't go out with an older man, unless I found him attractive.
NO THEY GO TO THEIR OWN INSTINCTS ON WHAT THEY WANT T ODO
You don't jump up and start yelling HEY PUPPY COME HERE!.
Their is no such thing as a girl friend when your a married man.
I know, was married 15 years to a person I barely liked but she had my two sons.
you don't wanna have a guy with a weak heart or less of a character.
because he already loves someone else
Sure it is, as long as there isn't a naked guy there with her :P
who you are, where you from
has told us they are hot.
Nice point Mace, women _love_ shopping.
If he doesn't want it you can always ship it to me.
I wear thongs and I wanted to know if guys like them!
Guys: How long would you stick around until she does?
if she does not bring a date have one set up for her.
(and most of us over analyze things!)
we dont do anything fun, he keeps me in like a hermet.
talk to him and ask him what is up.
JUST SAY YOU ARE SORRY FOR BEING A JERK............
just accept him for his flaws, someone might even see you as immature as well.
ask if he want to go out and then go from there but no sex on first date
BITE IT OFF TONIGHT AND TELL HIM MERRY CHRISTMAS YOU BASTARD
big teddy bear w/real diamond earrings
just start flerting with her magnificent body but if she slapped you, am not responsible
WELL HUMMMMM IT ALL DEPENDS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
And probably sharing the same bed with him.
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING I WAS TOLD A LONG TIME AGO.
If you will like some more advice e-mail me  littlecastgirl@yahoo.com
)DO IT FOR GOD DO NOT HAVE SEX   reyesempire@yahoo.com
and get back to being you.
i say  get a neutral friend to ask him.
no, it doesn't...as long as she is comfortanble with how she looks with it.
or 'lol i wouldn't do her'.
GET HELP AND GET IT FAST!
if you wait for marrage you bring something special to the marriage bed.

They keep telling you that it's wrong and dirty.
My hubby & i make love!
You obviously don't, yet you're still hanging in there.
ARE YOU SCARED THAT SHE WONT LIKE YOU WHEN SHE FINDS OUT HOW YOU LOOK OR WHAT?
he might feel threatened and feel as though he'll lose u
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND THAT JUST THINKS ABOUT HIMSELF
Hi, I m.....Start talking to her.
Many shy guys have an easier time getting dates that ways.
start out slow and you'll know when to speed things up.
and why dont u date blacks, what is the deal with pps, pps are funny.
Yes you are a booty call.
well all i can say is....i never saw the rave on tom cruise till the movie collateral....and YUMMY!!
When u r a man and she is a woman so no need to have a big size
All males dont cheat upon their girl friends.
If he wants nothing serious, then go where your heart tells you.
Trying not to be too cold here, but ARE YOU INSANE??!?!?!?!?
Not to say other women dont.
u'll find the right guy, there's some1 for every1.
i hope thats not ur mom or dad cause that would suck1!!!!!!!
But feel free to pick up the tab once in a while.
Other wise, move on and find someone who really deserves you!
maybe you kinda learned to like him just because he is the only one around.
Or they are desperate to get a guy.
If you were a guy id say.. Are you crazy ?
Dinner and a movie always works!
She has to be very relaxed!!!
remember  chicks b4 dicks.. and in love there should be change cause ther is soo much compromise.
I guess it all depends though!!
so whats worse making two meals or losing your best friend
did you grow up near gay people?
hi, this question was repeated earlier.
I think they should do something to these little fast ass girls.
i dont know y they don't make me leave
do you really want a friend who treats women badly?tell him he has lost a friend and a wife
so when we try to get a clear answer, yall can't make up your mind.
If I want to fight I'll get into poitics.. :D
An idea that is in your head.
If you know somebody that go to that school, ask if they know that person too...
Find someone that you enjoy hanging out with and then ask them to be your girlfriend.
and you look that good , man.
She sounds like my last girlfriend (someone I nearly proposed to).
I'm guessing your not the brightest bulb in the house??
ok i have been seeing this girl for 2 months.
took the good girl to xmas but lookin for the bad girl on NYE...... ;-B
your time and attention...now get offline and get to it
Just admit it that you were just looking.
Just make sure they never come between you!
It's because you don't have them.
...and that may sound harsh, but I mean it kindly.
what they have onthe outside could be very different from the inside
depends on her age and if she is a relative
If you are a guy, ask a chick.
No.But some men are really sex maniacs.
because you are not looking in the right spot
PLEASE OH PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.
you might have low self esteem
plus according to my guy friends if girls didnt do that half the funof gettin them would be gone.
well yeah a lot of boys do.
Dump his sorry ass and live well.
one thing you could ask yourself is, do you guys have good comunication together?
NO, I like to kiss girl
u can never tell boys are really weird unless he makes it obvious
it's definately alright with him, and he knows why.
If you only met her once, are you sure she is your girl friend?
i'm 13 so i don't have more than that and i spent a lot on xmas
Absolutely NO, Would any guy find a farting lady sexy?
Just be straight with her and be like im sorry but this just isnt working out .
HUH, is plastic hot, are brainless bimbo's hot...
keep it up - you're scoring huge points with her...
it might scare her off, not wanting her life with you on here.
Too many things happening out there in the concrete jungle...so you would have to be very careful.
no it just mean there is something wrong
I'm a 22 yr. old lesbian & have a crush on a beautiful older woman...
On average most men don't really care about all the little details in the wedding.
but i think that most wives cheat because of lonliness and lack of intimacy.
it depents if you have contiunous comunication!!!
Do you want to hang out?
Maybe its your right ring finger.
ONLY THE NASTY ONES LIKE YOU DO
Girl, I was just having the same conversation with a friend of mine.
But i would be tempted if u wear pink.
but 12 years later, im still wishin'.
you won't have any pain after that.
but you might not be soft hearted like i am!
Do whatever it takes, but get out of there.
and when you think your ready talk!
And if they are, those are the ones that don't last.
try tickets to an event (sporting, concert, etc.)
find some ugly stupid not cool friends kidding i'm not sure how to do that
tell him get back together or theres no way you can continue a relationship like that with him.
First you have to get him to admit he wants to quit.
I need answers from both sexes Plz ;-)
life is always fuller when you have love.
well that may just not change.
if she fails either of the 2nd 2 tests, go back to square 1.
break up, and Run forest run!
2 me, not really, it just depends on wat u think
I have no idea but you sure have one hell of a talent for coming up with questions.
so you had a bad experience, big deal, so have i.
I've done this before with close friends and it really helped them a bunch!
Just a little friction just the right way, and hey  we're ready!
rob this girl from you frd
i thought an ankle braclet had a meaning of some kind, i am wrong?
he loves you but heis best friends know whats up with him.
Air Supply, Making Love Out Of Nothing At All
if you take expect something to happen and sometimes things do not go the way you think they will
IF NOT TALKING TO HIM WILL  HELP RECOVERING PROCESS.
They are just trying to run your life.Thats what it sounds like to me.Do what you think is right!!
He has gotten in the habit of step one, step two, bingo...over!
but remeber, the power is not in the breast but the nipple.
If he's just friends then it's fine.
First off, do the usual and ask their name...
women change after sex, they get even more moody
Everyone needs time on their own...
montel had a great show about it.
u can use the ever most popular phrase don t worry its me not u !!
a person should not rush to loose thier virginity.
if the retina moves to the right... its an indication
it seems like the only reason you want tater back is because now you're alone.
we've always liked eachother ever since we met, but in prior relationships!
Smart, sexy, hot, or fun girls can all be terrible in other ways.
I don't know too much about girls liking it, but my buddies who whack off sure do!
just tell him that if he don't switch it off, you will turn on yours
Initiate the foreplay....you deserve some O's too!
hell to the nah a long distance relationship would never work out, trust me it wont.
ok not all girls are like that.
i truly luv her she is the one no dought but we are only 15 and she doesn't no
its what men tell to women to get them to the bed
They got married when he was 22 and she was 33 and they're still crazy in love.
If hes your boyfriend and he does not notice you, THATS SAD!!!
I DO KNOW YOU CAN PROBABLY CONTACT ME ON ME E-MAIL IT'S HOLAGURRL411@yahoo.com
u cant controll ur heart .
No way can she not want to show you in return how much she loves you too!
well don't call him n bug him cuz he might say ur eazy!
Basically speaking, we'd do anything for the other person.
then girl make your bed rock as hard as u can!!
If ur married, NO.....just isnt right....would u like ur spouse to cheat on u?
its possible that you have nothing to do with this
Tell her thats how guys are born.
then girl make your bed rock as hard as u can!!
If ur married, NO.....just isnt right....would u like ur spouse to cheat on u?
given on the family member, sorry.
its possible that you have nothing to do with this
Tell her thats how guys are born.
But don't try to hard, girls can always tell and there is nothing more unattractive or repulsing than desperation.
a home boy have u ever heard of the song  lovers n friends?
he well tell you that he like's you
It just looks like the guy has no self-confidence.
I am 13 and just wonderin
no honey, probably not on the long term.
Grrrs are crazy about men, cause men r crazy about grrrs.
have you discussed it with him?
THE ONES THAT HAVE SLEPT AROUND A LOT ACT AS IF THEY'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING.
it all depends on the person you have a crush on.
Kissin another guy is really bad.
Men are dogs well lots of them are NOT ALL ARE!!!
)Look DON'T do it GOD Will BE MAD.
Which was funny caus ehes a dick.
so you can have some type of play back for both your mom and the police.
It seems like they've gotten to an age, where they don't care what people think.
Keep looking and don't give up.
maybe youre like me and find that there are too many mean people in the world.
It's not that it's yummy, but it's not so bad !
sure they will!after all a hottie like u is gettin' married
It is so not worth it!
You're doing a great job already... Tell her exactly what you've told us.
Girls use them cause they are saver and u dont have 2 make it breakfast in the morning!
GIVE HER SOME ROSES AND CHOCOLATES AND JUST KISS HER ON LIPS.
If he doesnt, at least you are having fun and probably dont need him anymore.
i jump to what i love and if he fell the same way then you are cooking with gas!
is there a way to stop this or should i just join the club to make it even?
smell good look good and have a possitive attitude
no one is worth ruining a good relationship!
what will you do if you like somebody,and he/she did not like you back.what will you do.
All he wants you for is sex
use your tongue, but dont over crowd the other persons mouth with it.
black and green = get him an xbox (not 360) and netflix
because you have a higher sex drive then him you need sex more often.
alright Liv Tyler tell Ben Affleck to put that animal cracker in your mouth already!
it's really one of the girls attractions.....
and you are the one, but if not true do not use it as a line.
PUT IT THIS WAY IF YOU REALLY LIKE HER GET HER SOME REAL DIAMOND EARINGS.
not one man is the same and because their are so many of us,there are so many different prefferences.
If that doesn't work, get yourself a drug habit..lol
ps - While hes gone, wanna hang out?
Probably because he knows how men are.
i know that we're friends and nothing more ever again.
if so, then see if she's trustful.
If you want to be with him then don't expect anything out of it.
and dont cover the other persons whole mouth with your lips.
Usually guys who date alot have commitment issues.
take good care of you self becouse  you have something realy especial.
and the best way to find out is to ask him out.
what normal guy wouldn't like a naked girl at home when he walks in the door?
Hey, I'm looking for aliens too!
(sorry, that is the only word i could think of).
I finally said this:  Look, there is no way that we will ever be romantically involved.
no one is mr. or ms. perfect.
it's because people find joy when they're having sex?
I firmly believe that even the best of the few good men out there are really jerks deep inside...
or go to yahoo chat, thy have a interracial dating chatroom in the romance section.
Guys these days just dont value respect the way they did way back when!
Want a 10 point for this
if u luv him go 4 it as soon as u see him
Guess what I got it and You can't have it is a great attitude to have.
im sure she knows and always has known that someday you would want/need to know.
Well tell him things that actually matter.
You call him your guy friend?
Next time I would go with him.
Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise!
and if he has a rep for cheating then why set yourself up for heartbreak!
I knew before I ever even spoke with him.
The same way one woman likes pizza and another likes sushi....just personal preference.
She'll just have to get over it.
Its not bad if you like it and nobody actually gets hurt.
Finally, remember that women cheat on men too!
Otherwise ..great he's being honest but nope , no ring on your hand yet!
WHEN YOU ARE A YOUNG CHILD YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IN LOVE AND HATE.
But I kinda like this other guy in Hawaiia.
Like my mama always told me, Mind ya own business.
because you have not met me yet
You probably just pick the wrong women.
ya give up on him girl.. it could probably work out but it will most likely get ugly...
i'm 27 and my girlfriend is 40 and I dont think its gonna work.
thats true(all those answers up above)!i'm a russian woman and that is it(thats not why i'm here).
only if he's breathing really heavey.
Because that's the way love goes

Plus, girls look at other guys too.
a new place will help a lot.
She grew out of it, I think.
in what year did they get married
if they think thier in love then thats how they feel.i don't know!
you have to say wat age/grade you are.
by her charming smile which the man will never find the same
I guess it goes to show that, even if you're not dating, you can still get dumped.
Men are very different, some like breasts, some like butts, some like face only, while others like sluttish looking.
i rily like blue but why they are using them as that way
depending on the area you are in.
DON'T RETURN UNTIL YOU'VE SOLD 12 PAIRS OF SHOES.
I not sure if were going to reconcile.
it would ne nice..especially if u are askin them to leave for awhile so u can be alone.
Be careful though, she might want to just be friends.
You keep doing what you do.
I wanna come out of this.
is he hot if so heck ya if not no
just go up to him and ask thats what i did to ask out my girlfriend
i am not saying your mom will not believe you but there could be a chance that she won't.
if that dosen't work practice talking with one of your girl friends that you really trust.
and if so do you think it is possible to ever feel that strongly about anyone ever again?
And know that eventually, things are going to be ok, even if that moment looks far away right now.
Best way, is to spend time with all three of you.
the 11th finger for a boy, and on your thumb for a girl.
So try to spend time realy talking with her.
with someone you love it can be very special.
He says he is in love with me.
thier very deep feelings that we can't control!
- having a girlfriend while hating people?
but his girl (my friend)just broke up wit him.
we do not wnat to continually be hurt!
dont worry your boyfriend loves you just the way you are!
go get yourself some and find out.
Good luck, you already godn'thave anything to loose.
Want to hang out Saturday night??
stalk them back or confront them
all we need is some good dick and they can go on they way
ask her if she feels for u if no then keep what u feel 2 urself!
and remeber there is the right person out the for u!
they have little other objective on earth.
ur guess is as good as mine
lololololol just tell her shes too fat to fuck
so he could be ugly but treat her like a queen.
there are so many things as to why people cheat.
We really love eachother though, What should I do?
No, and you should not be.
b4 he gets to out of controll.
Do you even wanna date exclusively?
they badmouth others only to hide their own imperfections.
( in my opinion) i dont want to feel like im sexin a child...
Leave him, get on with it.
something u will learn when u grow up
BECAUSE THE WAY THEY WERE RAISE..........
playing games is the worst thing to do when you really care about someone.
what do women really want from men?
You shouldn't care about what people say and as long as she is happy.
probably because you think in a gay way, act in a gay way...and you like it
or have kids with?....people like that is so ignorant and needs to get a life
Some men are able to manage them, some aren't or don't think it is worth the bother.
Especially if the guy eats lots of fruits.
hey its always good to be on ur b/f buddies good side!
buddy women dont know what they want.
If you have to ask, you haven't.
when u getta girl u can show ur tru side.
dont be surprised if ur women thinks ur so amazing that ur going to leave her.
but if he is sweet he gets sweet in return
old if you're trustworthy, responsible, & mature...18 yrs.
If you really care about the girl then why the heck not?....
START  SEXY SMILES WITH  THE GIRL NEXT DOOR AND TOU WILL FIND YOURSELF BEING HER CENTRE OF ATTRACTION
I get drunk and stoned and forget abotu work.
Pray and ask GOD WHAT TO DO?
if she's really romantic wit you to then fine
in love & romance sector b'coz no one answered me b4 i put it in news&events sector
Chances are she already knows and just can't find the motivation.
If he love's you he will not have sex   5.
Go out there and find yourself a fine lady.
THEN IF SHES THAT DUMB U DONT NEED HER, EVEN IF SHES HOT!
it's been very interesting and entertaining so far!
Marriage can cost a lot of money!!!!!
i still regret it and wouldnt put myself in that postion again.
Obviously, if my life was on MTv, id be f*ked too.
;-) And hey, you can always call her on her staring problem.
If she still doesn't want to do anything...get out now.
lol well from experience, asking gets you nowhere.
The dude is a control freak.
This place turns a lot of guys on...
if the person rejects u just always remeber things  happen for a reason.
ya i think some of my friends are jerks because they think the oppsite .
There are plenty of fish in the sea.. keep looking
My dad's side is really fun to hang out with, and my mom's side is always unpleasant.
buy him a slinky or play-doh.
kiss him on the tip of his manhood.
IF HE DOESN'T RETURN, THEN HE WAS NEVER YOURS.
you can tell if you really love that person open up your eyes.
anyways, i think that guys would do that only if they felt threatened(ex.
Talk To Her With out them seeing you.
you cant say for certain he is cheating on you.
not if that's the color you dye your hair!
In the end if he is the right BOY you two will know it and hook back up.
Get a girlfriend and move on!!!
you could well look like bill gates.
And yes, girls usually like it, they say !
Lots of people like me at school.
Guys like myself are good guys who the bad boys don't have the guts to mess with.
maybe you could sit down with her and try to work things out.
I walked in on kim kissing another girl.
its like your asking why is life unfair?
somewhere where you can talk, and there are plenty of other people around (so that she feels safe).
(IE, Russians wear their wedding bands on their right ring finger)
If he takes his time you should be fine
the guys who act like jerks dont last long.
also if he cheers you up if your sad
one, and make it very pretty
If you feel it is a ploy then don't bother.
just come out and ask them.
YOU KNOW HOW BACK IN SCHOOL YO HAD THAT STATUS AND U DIDNT WANT TO LOOSE IT?
I'm just hoping it's not anywhere close to now.
cuz if he likes you due to the effort you exerted, you won't be happy.
Good looking or not a woman looks for the heart!
Stay with him then go on Jerry Springer.
its hard to find someone thats completly for you so when u find them you cant help love them.
if you were in your parents of familys place what would you do???
thank u all who answer me!!!
Anyway...  That stuff is usually good.
because your heart tells you so, and you can feel it inside your heart.
Ok, that will be $8 please.
yes you will if you get connected to me
NO ONE deserves some pinhead yelling at them.
For girls, and i am a girl, it was uncomfortable.
Don't let someone walk on you.
The ones that dont... it isn't because they don't like money, its because they make a choice.
Only some idiot redneck would want a girl because her breasts are big or whatever.
I wouldnt feel bad about it thought.
like dress nice or something just tell me
you're too lazy to get out and meet?
that just makes if worse for every one involved.
and have a couple buddies that married older woman
if you are 25 years old it,s not ok, but if you are 80 years old.........
dont put your lifes in a situation you will regret!
What were you doing around a brothel??
i you know any of his info u can look him up some other way...but damn girl,u fucked up
well, dating any races for that matter is not that important.
your ring finger on the left hand.
then find 1, she wont just fall from the sky... ask somebody out.
i hope that it helps u a lot.
IF YOU CAN'T OR DON'T WANT TO REPORT HIM THEN DON'T.
Why do guys lie about it?
(trying to keep this clean here).
thats y guys get so frusterated...b/c theur not as smart as us to fully comprehend!
But I will tell you a little secret...
When men have sex it's just that sex.
because just like me, they long to be close to you
NATURALLY, GUYS ARE MORE TURNED ON BY WHAT THEY SEE.
love = opposite sex friendship - same sex  (switch if gay)
everyone says that he still loves me n wants me back... i dont know wut to do
Spoiled women are alot of fun when you give 'em what they want and then some.
Wow, what kind of women are you hanging out with?
my friend caught him sleeping around last fall.
I did and it hurts me every time i see this girl with her boyfriend.
+ let him go, go out w/ someone in your own grade.
its nice to really know him/her in person to make sure that he/she is not fooling around.
love makes us all  do dumb thing trust me i know.
just find a girl that looks nice who you can be open with
The way I see it, if you guys are meant to be then you will be.
they cant depend on their bf or gf 4 evrything, wut happends wen the other person dumps them?
He even gave me diamond earrings-but now he wont talk to me, i feel rejected.
SO I WOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT IT UNLESS YOU SEE SOME WRONG DOING IN THE FRIENDSHIP.
It just seems like you are ready then.
if u do that- you'll score big points w/ him!
stop looking for her... she'll find you
If I were you (and I am not) I would not change a thing.
try telling her how you feel and bying her things
plus you love HIM and are with HIM now not the others.
like whut is they really about in life
Right now you are probably feeling lust.
Depends on what you call cheating...
you will know when you find it.
I have no idea what a delmarva is...
Just tell him like it is.
so it is only 50% fool proof.
If you really love the girl, you won't be afraid to meet her parents.
and stay home for a little time to myself.
Do you not like being gay?
I usually don't spend more than about $20-30 if I can, because a.)
Attention, alot of it is very important!
no grrr wants a guy with dandruffy, stink hair!
She is like My sister and I love her alot but I dont know How to deal with this.
Don't worry, you're not alone there (hee hee).
spill it i jus did and it went great
It's hard but hang on in there.
Relaity, if it's like men it varies.
If you want her to do more things in bed than let her know.
so no use putting an age limit etc.
The guy always thinks the gals loves him.
maybe it was only lust and not love to start with.
you picked the wrong guy.. and usually guyz are jerkz.. lol they never really ay attention to u
if she is not that close to you, a necklace would be better.
I'M DOING SOMETHING WRONG... SOMETHING DIRTY ..
Find a girl who you love a lot.
Ask him how its all going.
you knew how she was before you married her and now you want to use that as an  excuse???
plz talke 2 me in arabick if u want thx
you might bleed a little your first time
A WOMAN...At least in my case!!
ONCE A CHEAT, ALWAYS A CHEAT!
then wait for her reaction and carry on what she said
(**  )<| Dead Fish Ollec, the Fish Slayer
only he texts her just friends he says men lie
And i think , i don't need to say why .
I feel like im being to romantic with my girl and i think that might scare her off
you are a diamond in the ruff and she would be crazy to let you go!
if you find one let me know where and if she has a sister.
Be sure that he knows, you like him, but don't be stupid(!)
you will know and if you are young YOU BOTH have your hole life in front of you!!
Do something really rude to the guy(not to yourself)
Uhhhh.... no cause way 2 much of an age difference DDDDUUUUUUHHHHHHH!!!
Too bad you don't live in New England about 400 years ago...
I just dont want my kids in a shelter.
hey  my e-mail is pyro_97531@yahoo.com are u really gonna e-mail me
Please, once you find out, tell my wife!
Or are you a non-Mormon trying to find others like yourself?
relax... oh, make sure the guy wears a condom.
Play a game on Yahoo Games.
If not I would say you really don't have much to loose, obviously you are not that happy.
depends on how old you are!
But guys and girls CAN be friends without the sexual attraction.

Girls love that kind of a guy.
But that is to be expected and is a good thing.
love implies respect, but if u cheat you respect neither her nor you.
Also, just try talking to him more, especially if you guys have some interests common...good luck :)
be friendly keep ur mouth shut and be a strong and silent dude
If this person is a life long acquaintence then no doubt.

do things yourself for you until he is ready.
i never make the 1st move...i need to fight to keep women away from me.
My dad is always supportive no matter what.
We love corny stuff, so don't worry that it's too weird.
'cause they both sex fiends... basically whoever they see that they like... they will hump... thats why.
love is a very deep word so is hate.
how can a shy guy start making girlfriend
And willing to meet her half way!
dont try it unless you have meet this person because anything could happen over the internet
horn dog...my fantisy is two guys and me
i herad that green is the horny color!
elijah wood because he has amazing eye's!
promise him you won't tell your mom or dad and if you have to, earn his trust.
Get a girlfriend and try with her.
You got to love to hate, and so on.
my sister did that a lot too.
Even if you don't believe in God you can still read it.
IF U GET SLAPPED,SHE IS NOT INTERESTED ELSE URS ASH.
and your girlfriend/boyfriend knows you're that type then its not cheating...
it is about interacting with the person u love
maybe she sobered up and realised you were ugly when she wasn't drunk *wink*
...I am no longer my own but yours.
If you have to ask how do you know, youre not.
:)  actually, honesty is the best way.
Thats some bull, she is getting waxed every night homeboy.
Don't ask for forgiveness, women don't forgive.
you make your own decisions just dont worry about it
and you'd get more agitated if they persisted.

two outta three aint bad, little cuzin   :-)

I have met 2 guys online and they both went down hill
He will look at you a lot.
it happens, once in a life time, twice if youre lucky.
Only if you get his wife's permission first.
If she can't skate, it's even better.
Heck, I don't even think one can even SPELL <
Sexiness is juz a thing that can help the person u love tobecome more inlove with u...
So what if she doesn't look like a runway model?
maybe start walking with her daily.
ask for it very nicely or give her foreplay so good shell beg you for it
people always like dreams than reality is it not?
guy can also play with girl feelings if he is inteligent
I want a person that I can trust.
how bad does she want sex?
Oh and never make her pay the bill lol [jk]
When you always think that person
Damn that could have bein me.
you can always do fall colors (lead with red but also oranges, yellows, browns, etc).
does he find ways to always touch you?
If she is hanging with them alot, she might be trying to make you jealous.
If you are in love you know it, if not you know it.
If you asked when, I say never...but then you're asking how...you have to pay i guess
I found true love and I hate being away from him.
As for the yahoo ad... WHO CARES!!!??
Girl, you are like flour....I knead you.
if it doesn't work out, you're not out alot of dough.
Once a cheater always a cheater
Try to make it a fancy restaurant.
THAT IS ALL THAT IS OUT THERE ARE STUPID GUYS.
but it doesnt have to be as great and pretty as ur dinner.
it's like asking why do we hate.
because if a man treats me bad he can kiss well you know.
The best would be to move on...it isn't always easy...
If it does, I would like to know it myself!
i think that will be cool!
You gotta make a tough call.
What is it with guys and breasts?
its better not to do it.
Even saying somthing in the wrong tone.
Or just send him a note on a holiday!
be glad hes being honest with you and tellin you instead of cheatin on you.
Its like being in love with love.
you're best and only girl friend should be your wife.
Fighting for freedom and yet the one person they should trust stabs 'em in the back!
New love equals new life.....Even friends and families love can help a little  ;)
just jokingly, but that's just me.
i think i've seen it on t.v.
this boy is my worst enemy, but he has the biggest crush on me ever!
i would hes got some issues behind that...he shouldnt be leaving his underwear around and real men were boxers
it could also be not his sexule preff you might do the mature thing and privatly ask him.
It'll make you look like a devil worshipper or something!
And dont forget to keep eye contact!
and when u see him u will know.
just show him what u really fell be honest .
GOODLUCK and remember it is a NEW YEAR make it a good one!
Well if he is just now getting his Divorce then he was NOT YOUR man.
i am currently waiting and im a guy.
Don't know never had ruff sex!
or black dresses with deep red flowers - depends on how casual or formal your wedding is.
lol.. so yeah.. size matters, but it don't have to be huge, just atleast average!
(work, play, education, whatever you do).
2-always be ready to try something new 3-spend more time together...go on dates
I really don't want surgery but I'm at my wit's end.
If you know the guy is being abusive.
Having your fav icecream or candy avail is always sexy and tasty.
Love is crazy... and I LOVE IT!
A little more than a friend but with a whole lot less meaning.
A kind compliment.........taking her to lunch.......doing things that show her exactly how much you love her.
(and you know what i mean).
Never have ONLY ONE  girl spinning.
And it's not like they are ALL THAT.
Browse yahoo personals...that's where I met my husband.
because we didn't try being married
No because women don't appriciate a man just taking care of her.
thats the different in life between men and women.
And then get mad when you don't want nothing more to do with them?
he is the one who screwed up...kill it, its not luv..its ur ego.
If he's messing around behind your back, and you don't like it, just dump him.
Sweetie, you cant be in love with someone you don't know.
stayed friends -thats all- for 6years.
by expressing ur 'communications' with another 'miss'  :)
THEY MUST HAVE SOMETING GOING ON!
Maybe you have just bored him to death
when kissing breath hard and bit there lip gently
i dunno...if classmates doesnt work then i dunno.
married and with a beutiful 2 year old.
well, u know how it is with guys wanting to stay on top of it all, right?
This works pretty good to (she won't think your player).
As you grow up date many girls and get lots of experience, Good Luck!!
I know if a woman climaxes with me, she probably wasn't with me.
But it's bad if you go too fast.
BY NOW YOU KNOW THAT CHICKS DIG TALKING...SO, GOOD LUCK!
(I'm still the horny guy she married):-(
now once they conquared one, they move on to conquar another.
IF HE RETURNS, THEN HE'LL STAY 4 EVER.
Make it romantic, unless you know full well she DOES NOT like romantic things.
Even if other people feel it is wrong who cares about them?
a bundle kisses with red rosees.
someone to insist ,to come along with during my life.
What happens if you get caught?
i have tried everything because im very sexual.
im more sexual then my husband.
ask yourself: does he look at you differently than your other guy friends?
ur lucky that u r evn friends.
well its ur fault in the first place.
coming from a guy he probably has someone else and is using u as a friend w./ benefits
i would have to say YES!!
love doesnt have an age minimum!
haha Talk to your husband, don't cheat.
for woman to do rather than men!..
i would take my wife out every other week.
( although that's good, too! )
I THINK THAT PUTS A WOMAN IN A POSITION TO RECEIVE A LOT OF CRITICISM
man is Jesse MCcartney, and girl is Britany spears.....
(as much as I would want my gal to be that special)
Smart girls are fun to hang out with ... Smart girls are sexy.
Get dressed up and go to a nice place and see how he reacts.
Don't do things that you dislike just to impress a girl.
worse.....cause the courts would be full of couples gettin divorced...
k..we get the fresh breath thing.
And I care about him a lot... and I cheated on Darryl with Lou.
Because he's getting mad at me because I make more
its ok, becouse the older girls have more experience in sex and they can better satisfy u...
You never really know whats going to happen unless you try...
All you have to do is look!
That but I hope you good luck.
You could just smell his dick.
Don't forget, women go grey too!
Not right then, but after a few days.
well, dont tell her to get over herself!!!
It worked for me (I got her phone number) then asked her out.
good for him, but aren't you going to be there??
There are many things that bother u. so try to bother them.... love is jus one among many!!!
colors i would avoid - pinks, purples, pastels.
OTHERWISE GO ON THE WEBSITE THAT HE IS ON AND REPORT HIM AS AN ABUSER.
There got to be a lot of guys out there who woes her.
I found mine...it just took the courage to leave & believe I deserved better!
you might have to look for larger built women.
I dont really know but that sucks.
Aww dang I knew I forgot to do something!
Good Luck.....I think women are smarter than that...LOL
some like it big, some like it small and some even like both.
umm maybe expensive drink for having good time
do the rings bearers walk before the flower girls?
maybe when the children are old enough to be a ring bearer/flower girl
I hear some people play sport on weekends though.
Black men are beautiful....Keep trying I'm sure all women in MN arent like that.
i still love him but i dotn show it.
I told her she and he was full of it.
You should be enjoying it too!
NOT all men but some do.
some win and some lose, yet it is how you deal with it that matters
I don't think it stands for anything.
Who told you that men don't look for a relationship?
If he loves you so much that won't matter.
Some women are just that way.
but i was so flattered by this youger womans advances my physical will power just wasnt there.
depends if your a jerk to them quess.
(I, guessing thats what you had in mind?)
yea...you should ask her out...and since ur already friends....there is a WAY better chance that she will say yes.
so everything you listed, if you mean a glance as in lust.
Do all of us a favor, though...TAKE THIS PERSON DOWN!
But never give a lady yellow roses-those are for your sick grandmother!
and how do i tell my viego?
So anyways this guy tried kissing me.
to some it is like scotch whiskey...you have to develop a taste for it.
cuz he wants too look at ur ass and he doesn;t like u 4 who u r.
and why would I want a GIRL to be my BOYFRIEND???????!!!!!!
Is she willing to come to me?
Depending on who she is, she might like some other stuff...
your self esteam can not be that low.
Keep ur hair combed an look people in the eye.
though after a while she really needs to have a good personality.
if you are a teen ager go to a predominantly black high school.
no, unless you count what was in my thoughts.
a sad Christmas.. like if you're not with your loved ones.
Rip the band-aid off, as they say.
and on the other hand a slim with over sized doesnt look impressive.
For pregnant woman... it helps them alot because it makes it easier to have there baby.
Maybe he wants to cool things down a bit.
Does he ever say I love you without you saying it first?
Don't mess with things if he has a girlfriend.
But DEFINITELY call him and tell him immediately that this is bothering you!
Maybe a holiday kiss would do?
Otherwise, just buy lotion, perfume, or body wash stuff like from victoria secret...every girl likes that!!!
If I love her then I dont want anyone else really.
we're not complicated...were just beyond ur knowledge of understanding!
This man is all about himself!
you wouldn't want to be branded as a racist, right?

I know exactly what you mean about the black guys.
IF YOU THINK HE'S CHEATING HE PROBABLY IS.
But one thing to remember is that you get what you pay for!
You must be one hot guy.
Now that song will be in my head all day!!
im talking about that emotional bull crap.
as soon as he knocks someone up it's over.
eat light drink a little smile and sleep then u'll dream of this woman
if u really love her, u should stay strong.
If you are a mature person just ask him.
Yeah, sorta what Fallon Chambers said.
haha, yea if they are pot heads :-D
IF SHE DOESNT KNOW YOU THEN WHY DONT YOU TELL HER WHO YOU ARE?
don't ever lose hope because they are just around.
I HOPE SO:)  IAM NOT THAT OLD IAM ONLY 21.
people cheat for all different reasons....some still love their partner but just can't seem to stop sleeping around.
She went off on me saying that i lied.
Excuse me, it sounds like she needs to get rid of you, thats B.S.
There's lots of good women men just tend to over look them.
WIFE OR CHILD BEATING IS REPULSIVE AND HAS TO BE DEALT WITH.
...if you're the single guy she's complaining to, well - this all sounds great.
he didn't really care for you and he finally found his way out..
Don't feel akeward not talking...they are just being sad and thankful that your there with them.
im not talking about gifts here.
That means that Bob's friends can not ask you out, or date you (even if YOU chase them).
Not if you keep looking under the couch
If a man is too big, it freakin hurts!
you have to walk into it like you have nothing to lose!
if they are mean, they might hate you forever.
just cuz they're a guy doesn't make them obsessed.
You don't have committment problems, you just haven't found a guy that is on your level.
U HAVE TO ROAM OUT SIDE U CANT FIND ANY 1 SITTING IN UR HOME
and are they willing to change...
Trust me, I've met a LOT of girls off of the internet.
like when u want her to be u gf
Only you can ever know what your dreams mean.
in case of guys, guys like big(er) breasts.
If true love existed why do so many soldiers cheat and get cheated on?
u can buy perfume for him or u can ask him what he likes
if they like each other.NO PROBLEM
Make sure you are completely shaved (NO STUBBLE!)
Don't date dumb or evil women and you're golden.
(you do want her married to a nice man, right?)
It means she wants to go to a friggin movie!
ofcourse, you take care of how you look.
well, first of all, dont have sex with him anymore, act cold.
and actually, figured out that you really do love your man.
a Husband, a Boyfriend, that can provide & support her ... SEXUALLY & FINANCIALY!
For a dear lover, get her lylacs or johnson grass or something like that.
U can never rush or ever have 2 feel obligated 2.
It's OK to seperate the two.
I have no friends male or female cuz he don't trust them.
in short it's all about self confidence.
well short answer : I think I did obay my parents!
but lots are and if he was cheating then he's not worth jack
that way you wont be alone in this.
Yes most of the boys always have sex on thier minds.
they dont know how to get there feelings across without...acting like a little child
That's what I want in a man!
If you would then try asking him to dinner.
and on the other hand you know ur husband well.
Well..You will have to ask alot of people.. and get alot of different answers...
But she sat and thought about how things could be if i had never told her.
But really, and i know this sounds bad, but it is depending on your man's SIZE.
omg that makes me pissed...i myself have dated a black guy and there is NOTHING wrong with it!
yes there are many but all guys are not the same the best thing to do is ask them
i found my love....but i wanna know what people think love is.
ok i've struck out many times by doin' this .
SO LOOK WHAT I'M DOING NOW??
I never talked about hers but she did a lot with mine.
Sensitive guys have trouble approaching girls so fewer of them have girlfriends.
so what is there to be worried about?
Or maybe you need to take more baths?
i do miss him though...i miss how he used to hold me n never leave my side.
If you just want to have sex go for it, but if you want something more!
I love him but I know I desrve better.
Some guys go through with it, some guys don't.
Honey, baby, sweetheart... you are being played.. BAD!
just dont do it its a stupid thing to do and everyone gets hurt and offended.
or I'm kissing you, not him, so shut up already.
Sometimes I go off just because I hear my wife getting into it.
and how you project that to girls.
classic red dresses with mango calla lillies as flowers.
does he do things you ask him to do without the expectation of him actually doing it?
But don't overdo it, the brooding thing I mean.
it never hurts to just ask him to hang out
just depends on the dude actually
You just start hanging out, spending time together.
Some ppl are worth sacrificing everything for...others aren't.
becuase he wants to smell what you had for dinner...if ur smart enough to figure that one out
Is it true the once friendship becomes more, it is hard to go back being just friends???
its like he wants a no strings relationship.
where as on online u can say what ever u feel withou inhibitions.
Why is when you get married woman want to start comming on to u. what is that all about.
AKA: have fun with other men.
Start exerising, ex's hate to see the ones they dumped looking good.
I mean, you are not the town gossip for nothing.
Your a man now and you want a woman to keep you warm.
TELL SOMEONE SO IT DOESN'T KEEP HAPENING!!
you guys are bitchs, wat is so bad about her writing?
16 for girls, 17 for boys.
White guys don't even LOOK at me anymore.
its not the love thats doing the hurting... its the person you are expecting it from
but everyone is different and it's something yuo have to discuss with her.
woman don't play with mens' feelings.... men just don't listen.
rent her it's cheaper on your soul!
u could call him up to c how hes doing
its also the pride thing, he wont let you have your way...ever.
for a good name is foxy, that make a person feel sexy.
What is it with guys and breasts?
you'd be getting a lot of reply that would say: why do men cheat?
good q, good ans so far.
you are gonna leave him) and they gotta make you wanna stay!
he has to spend all his time caring for his child now.
if you ask me for you to say that you need excitement.. are you fulfilling your wife's needs??
Dress nice but not sexy at first.
atleaset twice a month the rest of the time we both make dinner or go to a friends house
just go with the flow when ur talking 2 the preson u like or love.
flirt with the cutest guy in the room
then if non of these are it sit down and talk to her.
you can buy condoms basically anywhere.
tell her friend and more then likly her friend will blab to her.
first off non-bitches girls who arent into themselves prudeness or (self control) honesty non judgmental easy going
What exacly is it any way?
Because girls often don't know what they want.
because is all about a mind connection... and the comunication problem is solved... is a more free.
we were assoc at my job and i knew him well b4 he approached me w/this.

- When you get the courage to ask some girl.
we were assoc at my job and i knew him well b4 he approached me w/this.
now we don't have much time.
cause they r the people with more money.
Just rent a girly porn movie !
Don't believe his crap for a second.
go direcltly and talk.. afterall there is always a first time when u talk to a person
sorry i could not help much
seemed to be interested, but how do i know?
love is something that worths running all life after and die for...
And he said bye and hung up.
I mean, was it an affair (i.e.
What the hell is wrong with people????!!
take it from a chick...i know these things
suicide yourself after askin ur wife hehe:)
Dont listen to them GO FIND HER and make hot sexy love to her thats what she wants!
In the end, is it really worth seeing things like I am?
Yeah guys are really strange aren't we?
If you have to ask, then you are not!!
LoL, What would be wrong with that?
3. does he truely love you for who you are?
If he has trouble getting a job there, has family here he doesn't want to leave, etc.
Yeah guys are really strange aren't we?
If you have to ask, then you are not!!
LoL, What would be wrong with that?
3. does he truely love you for who you are?
AND BELEIVE ME SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SMILE ABOUT ANY MORE AFTER I DO.
Give yourself time to get over him and get on with your life.
I feel like I dont want to be with anyone else.
(and I say that meaning no offense.)
Once a cheater, always a cheater.
well the moral issues shouldn't be a problem.
yes but its really whats on the inside that counts
try this have him be the house dad and you work.
I prefer Blondy with a brunette redhead
THATS THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR HIM RIGHT NOW.
It's just people, grrs & boyz.
And who knows, If you like it, try it...
whta is the right words that i should say to this kind of man?
But he has to make his own mistakes.
Kids have a funny way of picking up on things that are going on.
Well... mom always taught me to never get mixed up with a girl who already had kids.
Men think that love = sex and some men are not comfortable with that.
i let a guy know and leave the rest up to him.
i think she's using u for ur dick and likes women.
Or is it true once a cheater always a cheater?
The website NewFriends4U.com is a good start though
JUST BE THERE FOR HIM AND GIVE HIM YOUR SUPPORT.
dont waste time with a girl who is basically playing you.
Get some gift for her which she really likes in her life...

i'm sure you'll find someone more worth talking to anyway!
Ask, what does the other person have that I don't?
you dont ,they tell you they are
if U want U can mail me also
Now im trying to become friends with the new kid what should i do?
But.. thats just what guys do.
U will not be dating HER.
go, hug him/her, and say....i love you darling.
i want him back but i dont know how to ask.
Feed him Italian food, get him slightly inebriated, take him where *you* wanna go.
Does he seemkind of controlling if he wants to do all this??
If it ever happened again leave & dont look back.
Tell her what your hopes and dreams are for the two of you in the future.
could be a whole host of things!
i think u can flirt unintentionally, but if its purposfully i thinks not ok!
You just know, it feels right.
WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH BLOOD TO WORK ONE HEAD AT A TIME
u should try touching her or hug her a little more!!!
If she blows you off without a chance, chances are she isn't worth is anyway.
i dont know, but i really dont like them.
i dont think so...its really all the same
thats ok relationships fail and you get some experience for when you try again.
becaue u see ur self wise and never be mistake
YALL NEED TO SIT DOWN AND REALLY TALK ABOUT IT.
A promise ring doesn't fix anything up for real... keep tryin Best of luck
anywhere thats fits the mood...want it..do it!
the woman and ex brother in-law were freinds growing up in school.
she has her child alive and for money she lies that her son is dead.
And remember to write it down this time!
My best friend is a girl.
anywhere thats fits the mood...want it..do it!

And remember to write it down this time!
My best friend is a girl.
My wife is driving me crazy.
a guy wrot this it shoul make u think.....
just remember it takes two to play tango
not totaly committed...meaning your having an affair?
If he is a guy, he has been thinking about sleeping with you for 5 or 6 years.
act supercool do not play hard to get.
There are ways around a cheating husband; believe me I KNOW!
im SOOO... in love with this guy but what should i do???
I don't know why women get with guys that treat them like crap.
This year I am asking everyone to by me household things like lumber...drywall....etc.....how old is he?
tell him you like him and hope that he likes you too
women on the other hand only reach their sexual peak at a much later age...
my wife and i were married this month after meeting online.
Try using pillows (under her butt).
because they look prettier than girls when they try.
when the age difference makes the relationship illegal!
:P  And im not even one of those overbaring and controling guys.
The love of parents esp mother is the 'real' thing...so what is that about??
Because mostly use yahoo for chat purpose.
Then I don't go back there again.
They can't get that if a man makes too little money.
feelin' guilty about it so jus follow ur instinct, ok. good luck.Another thing, that prob.
But I have to agree, they are not men, they are still boys!
Do I diserve ur love ??
Same difference.....Don't believe it, it's BS.
Look if you are like most people you really don't have the money to spend anyway.
forget him if he doesnt luv u.
It matters wat your lover thinks.
most likely she isn't in to you.
Love is not lust but it sure does bring it on.
I would be happy to pray for you consistenly!!!
If you're happy and don't want the tax breaks for kids, etc.
and last but sertanly not least has to love God!
if you are doing it because you feel pressured or something like that, run the other way!
Having some control is good, but too much is BAD!
If you are a guy the you are gross.
Any way, Who cares I would like you any way even if it was past your sholders !!
yes i think it is wrong.
i've been in a situation like this before.
Your girlfriend would be upset too if you had a girl pick you up!
because most hot girls are idiots and just don't know it yet
my advice is to cool it and try to stay with one.
So u also doing like that to me.
Personaly I would say though... BALD AND PROUD!
sounds weird if u take it serious
Now i have a very nice husband of 13 yrs!!!!!
So u also doing like that to me.

it's the only thing that you know is going to happen in your life for sure
Now i feel like were not friends any more.
Girls want that challenge thats the same for a guy too.
Then yes, we ain't gonna get it.

he said 6 i said an hour he said a month.

Then yes, we ain't gonna get it.
no  you  cant  make  anyone  do  anything  that  dont  want  to  do
but i suggest u to keep ur love in ur heart and atleast live happily for ur family.
I was looking at a guy in my class.
If they come back to you it's meant to be!
Some guys don't like people rushing them.
Lots and lots and lots of hard work.
no u can not cuz its not stong enough s p r e m
(If you could, I would've by now)
I'm not happy, everything i try to achieve looks impossible...
If he cheats once, he will surely cheat again.
YOU KNOW YOU GO TO A PARTY AND WE YOU START TO DANCE WITH THEM.
Does he talk bad about his ex?
My boyfriend of 3 1/2 years cheated.
And I don't mean hair and eyebrows.
a gurl should like you for being who you are.
All i would have to say is something nice,pretty, and say that u like her alot.
So, thats why they cant profit from it.
doews he want to be w/ me or are these hints to back off?
Walk up to her and say Hi, I'm so and so.
you met him/her first, made friends with him/her.
Oh, and don't go crazy like Anna Nicole Smith ;)  haha.
I soppose you care about her, don´t you.
Take it and run with it........he isn't for you unless you like selfish men.
i mean, i know youre supposed to ply them with boone's farm.
Why are u in the middle?

I never got to tell him exactly how I felt.
for sex, fat girls will do just about anything you ask, sexual depravity know no bounds.
not just for yourself but for the children too.
he doesn't want me to go back.
well you have to let them know you're interested either by telling them or flirting with them.
because alot of girls now a days want to be wild , or they want your money lol.
AND SOMETIMES KIDS ARE WANT THEIR PARENTS TO STAY 2GETHER
You don't know because you don't see what's wrong with you.
you can flirt with me anytime  lol
don't let the spirit of embarrasment to over shadow u, talk it out!
because alot of girls now a days want to be wild , or they want your money lol.
You don't know because you don't see what's wrong with you.
you can flirt with me anytime  lol
till the time they feel to get rid of each other
i think i miss that same party lifestyle but having never had it im not sure what im missing.
I asked him if he liked it and fortunately he did.
Movie tickets + popcorn and drinks for 2
the other person climaxes or stops too soon?
i think i miss that same party lifestyle but having never had it im not sure what im missing.
I asked him if he liked it and fortunately he did.
CHEATING IS DANGEROUS AND IF YOU STAY HE'LL KNOW THAT HE CAN KEEP DOING IT
You are young and will find someone else because you sound like a good, descent person.
If she says it's cool, it's cool.
he talks to me alot but i dont know what to think
well  just talk to her and tell her there is nothing bad in having an orgasm.
Men...SEX and only sex...no room for anything else!
always be gentle, unless she likes it otherwise.
girls, like guys, want what they can't have.
so what u need to do is to tell him exactly how u feel--because he might not know.
Find me with a foreign especially American girl friend.
and that is something that will never change no matter what.
I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD MEET NEW GUYS.
last monday, she said me she was very sick.
That said, sexuality is not as ridgid as people think it is.
If you're not willing to discuss it with her, I guess you'll just have to forgive her...
(even if only in their own eyes:)
liz gave you a very good answer
If we did, you would be cooking right now and not on the internet asking dumb questions!
because the only two are gay.
well what do u want to do?
jus to cover d gals.........they jus show am havin lots of money.....simple
:) Ask about his life, etc
2. then you counsult doctor for testube baby.
ITS SO HARD WHEN YOU WEAR YOUR HEART ON YOUR SLEEVE.
Know something it's great to be married & there is a person to share your feelings, love, pain etc...
Even if this is your own mother!
good luck and i hope i helped!!
and give him a friendly little peck on the lips.
At least 16 or possibley older?
Ask her if just being friends online or on the phone is ok, as a friend.
Once again, I do not mean to offend anyone.
l need someone in my life
i think its because you can help others better than u can help yourselves.
U CAN LOVE ALOT OF PPL BUT U CAN ONLY FALL IN LOVE ONCE
at first it like youre floating on clouds and you only see the good things about him/her.
there no way to tell asking just that question.
doesn't really matter what its the thought that counts
who knows maybe he'll end up liking your best friend that thinks she's so hot...
Don't try to guess her feelings.
Of course, you got to do it right, you know.
keep in mind meaness is often from insecurity...
TO me I dont get it.
Marriage vows state that husbands come first.... period.... you know what you gotta do, so do it.
YOU CAN CERTAINLY FORGIVE, BUT THE HELL IF YOU CAN FORGET
Now I am in 8th grade and he is a sophomore in HS.
I have heard Dr Drew on Love line talk about this one a lot
and i like nice nerdy girls.
For one, props to what Richard said up there.
if he is having sexual problems he should be talking to you about it, not that other woman.
has he ever lied to u, even about little things?
wow honestly that si your decission but yeah.....it depends on how far you love her??
i think u better give room to those who love u very much then u love some1.
maybe he thinks you are a freak or desperate for trying to find true love on the internet
plant a bug on his bedroom
n i just dont know whether he ll ever be my guy or not!!
so dont waste your time on a woman, move on to another.
hair is what makes a man sexy.
But if it really bothers you, just talk tohim
sorry is hardest word but gudbye is the very difficult
will if you give her what she want you know take her out to a movies,restrarant,hotel and you know.......
take just as much as u give
So I'd just do whatever I want.
E-MAIL ME IAM MARRIED:) JAZMIN_LUCIFER@YAHOO.COM MAKE SURE THAT YOU ASK SOMETING
OVER 20,SHES WAS OR IS A PROFESSIONAL WH***

cuz not all of us are like that when we're young.
mbleditor - 2/27/2003 8:13:42 PM Fantasy place to have sex?
Her intensions are not good if she is doing that.
Or you could get him something that he enjoys, like some gourmet coffee...
why is he a jerk, or why doesnt he like them?
And if he really loved you, he wouldn't without good reason.

HONESTLY WE LOVE EACHOTHER BUT WE ARE NOT COMPARTIBLE HEALTH WISE.
Give your man good oral lafter a chick flick, and he will always go!
you may miss the paradise you let behind you !
Try U2 cds, thats what I got :)
it mean u didnt finish what u planned on with him.

It seems like if he said dont go that you wouldnt have gone.
forget that girl and get a better one.
u miss him and still have a crush on him.
but above all, love is something that keeps life going.
try Yahoo personal since you are a yahoo member already.
Chance is, if you belive she is, then she probably is?
she was 23 and you were 52 when you got married.
).almost everybody knows- dat girl is BAD.
she is stil the same girl.
i just think that men and women are equals.
just be the kindest parent to the kid
it may or may not help
13 was too young for me.
Just come out and say it.
Don't cheapen it with pick up lines, and act, or anything else.
dont worry some is loving u then u love this girl.
so i want to have fun and do crazy stuff cant do that with kids.
Don't you remember your own date of marriage??
My heart wants too but my head says not too.
dont think you can, im sorry
I think Im cute..but i'm not out of the closet...
why would you have to call first?
but first if your husband doesnt know - tell him - if he does tell him anyways.
Unless the guy doesn't want you to.
not all love is meant to be
I feel horrible, but I don't want to go back into this relationship, but I really feel heartbroken..advice?????????????????????????
and it depends on how old you are.
I like take him to whatever lookz like fun in town.
Let romance take its course...it does still work!
It hurts... because it's our fault, guys I mean.

and you'll know when youre ready!
Basically, be carefull, & don't let him&#92;her interupt your work duties & you SHOULD be fine.
The key her is practice and get confidence so that you don’t mess up with the one you want.
there isn't one answer to this question.
So I just don't do it.

the rhythm isnt quite right for you?
no, if it's not a good date, no need to kiss.
ask him to marry you - see what happens!
to hell with that...put your faith in yourself...seek what you desire and demand reciprocity.
Once a cheat, always a cheat!
you dont have to be married to make a family for your kids..if the dad will still stick around.
Or he may act like he love your kids just to screw u and go on his merry way.
Try to convince her that u are not going to cheat her daughter.
so you need to put out better or do better acts and he wil llike you better
CHECK IT OUT WITH YOU DOC
the side of your personality your boys will never see
surprises never seem to work out!
I like a girl touching me.
its actually good to do that.
MEN SHOULD BE RUGGED, STRONG MEN.
Torn between two lovers?Feeling like a fool?Loving both of them is breaking all the rules!
if you really like her alot but first you might want to check her looks
Well, if he can't let go, then you have to let him go.
BECAUSE THAT HAVEN'T MADE UP THEIR MINDS YET.
They don't sleep with EVERY guy .

i didnt get a chance to say good bye please anybody help me................
just another random person with some usefull advice
He probably wants to buy you out with money.
WELL I CAN RELATE TO THAT.
Go all the way but don't blow your load on one girl.
Thanks for your advice to my vacation question!!!
most defenitely ur not asking for too much.
They should be up by 12/16/2005
And with most guys they cant tell exactly when there about to come no way.
If you are my student...um...call me?
You blew it with this one.
it is just nations arguing (?)
Or your Mom asks at Christmas dinner.
if ur a chick and dig chicks
Try to tell her what the other things that concern you about marrying him.
Oh, and if you can cook.
well this is a it depends matter.
havent been there but dude its been 3 months already...
Females from other black seem to love...HUH??
should i talk to him, or see if he talks to me?
If he would hurt u that deeply twice in one life time, thats too much!
I just have to ask this, Cause I have to know!
tell her i like u more than a friend , i love u will u except my proposal ?
Don't let go of hope, Hope gives you the strength to keep you going!
This is a frequently asked question on Y!
They will then tell you !
- plus have you thought about your HEALTH???
I like this guy at work a lot.
then sometimes she will show what ur missing....like maybe bend over so you can see her butt or something.
THEN DON'T F**K AROUND WITH SOMEONE TO WHOM YOU ARE NOT MARRIED!!
If she's not the right girl, that should be a big clue.
then back to giving her the attention again.
for me i think they r interested in sex more than being love in the adolescence
He's going out with my friend now but I think there's still a chance!
Must you really ask this question anyway???
Sex is for the marriage bed only!
ears,  women love ears, dont know why
well,my opinion is if u have trust in your boyfriend,then u wouldn't have to worry about flirtation!
cuz we cant dance and its evil to make us dance cuz we are clumsy and stupid
just tell him as soon as possible.
don`t rush it men don`t like to be rushed on a empty stomac
DONT DEGRADE YOURSELF HES WITH YOUR FRIEND DO GO BACK FOR LEFT OVER LEFT OVERS
ask questions ..dont discuss religion..sex..or politics.
SAD BUT TRUE  Being something your not is a hard thing to keep going.
its simple they all think u r sexy and hot.
heres a SECRETE THAT MEN HAVE PASSED OIN FOR GENERATION TO GENERATION.
Well I'll just say this- Keep it real if you guys are always talking just ask.
Your kids come first no matter how old they are....SUPPORT YOUR KIDS!
Let the guy chase the girl.
Yes.And whenevr I feel like showing love, I kiss her
...or driving you crazy NOT wanting sex?
people change grl frnds.. every week!
Ha.. good question... now I know what to tell my girlfriend I want.
If he ever had his hair short (like when you first met him?
What should i do ive tryed every thing!
dsease because i hate to see babies suffer.
Do you mean the guys you have dated?
Think about yourself first and his feelings second.
honstely it all depends on the girl.
THey could not wait until they became GROWN.
you already have it in your head to find each persons faults and downfalls.
i am not even sure if she would like me to ask her or not.
The kind that gets other good things going !!!!!!
Like it is a one way street.
i l ask her whats this proposal about??
because some sup or vid models like average guys because they keep it real.
its alot better once u relax and just have fun, its not so serious.
cmon, u will find someone that want u as ur self!
i am pretty sure he is hiding something and he does not want you to know what it is.
definitely take her to small claims court.
he said he was going to back to his home state with or without me.
lol maybe you should hold your breath when giving a guy head so you don't suffocate.
ever try talking to one to see if you like them and vice versa.
Hints are BS...  Just say what you mean and stop assuming people are getting the hint...
Jeez... this guy could be a fake.
A friends mother gave her this advice..be careful who you date, you just might fall in love with them.
well the big question that i have is do you work as well?
ALTHOUGH, U KNOW THAT MEANS GIVING UP UR OWN; NO MATTER HOW BAD AND HOW LONG U HURT.
If she does things that you don't like around, quit being her friend.
Your wife and her feelings or a friend?
People don't know because they don't see what you see.
I dun trust and i dun sleep...no ways!!!
Probably because no one is there to tell them not to.
is he more friendly and touchy feely with u or is he just that way with everyone.
What the heck is her problem?
And honestly, why wouldnt a guy want a young beautiful woman?
I meet a girl on phone, we become very good friends.
then i got a loaf of bread.
i mean im a guy, im not judging, but.. what would happen if you asked them the question?
Jokes aside... no reason not to meet unless he is not who he says he is.
u might find out later you lost the perfect one.
Nice guys dont like nice girls.
The same things that unattractive women like!
I'm 51 so it is very hard.But gotta DO IT.
The way i look at it, if its meant to be its meant to be.
well it is not a turn off if you have children and it is.
If they are in love and there are no showstoppers then go for it.
meaning, you got her attention so go and propose!
Take her an run to the bed..LOL
it's been like that from day one in my house since both of us work.
spank the monkey if you have to but remember.
Hit it and move on your tooooo young.
try asking her what she likes.
You just go ahead be proud...She is a Pro player...Merry Christmas
do you two hold a friendship?
dont waste time thinking of ur old one
get around the corner and fill your belly.............booze or food........but as you know, booze is never good.
Then she saw that I didnt care, so she went for it.
I just admire the womans facial beauty and her good looks
How do I make it special?
You ever gave them a chance?
if you find that guy you'll be happy and it will last.
make sure u r gonna be able to understand each other
Might intimidate boys, but never men.
My ex-boyfriend's sister and i used to be really close.
yea it does on my girl
THEN WHEN THEY ARE ON THE DANCE FLOOR THEY FEEL INTIMADATED......
let time tell you weather you do or not.
coz he is known to be liking a girl who s very bad, showy (n fairer than me!!
give them a little bit to disipher that feeling.
Forgive her for what she did to you, get your man, and move on!
whatever happend to prayer in school?
(The funny thing is that I know all these thing, but I don't have a girlfriend.
you haven't found the right one.
first off, your kids should be your priority.
What kinds of things are you into??
The same way you always have!
If deep down inside he's an a hole then it might work but it's seldom worth it...trust me
i said i would quit my teaching job and go too.
it all depends on the guy.
mmm.... nice question but u didnt tell about ur charactor.

it all depends on the guy.
mmm.... nice question but u didnt tell about ur charactor.
Hrm..  Why not be friends with him and just be friends.
I have trouble with girls in the past, alot so if you can help me out...it would be nice.
no, he doesnt love you beyond your body.
never stop smiling, because you never know who's falling in love with your smile!
Am I going to get hurt?
u can start with a punch line.
there is a generation gap between the 2 of you.
Why wont you ask her out?
also when they have very sexual realtions towads each other then they are lesbian!!!
most important thing is dont give up!!!
But reality is, that it would be like dating your mother.
what if the guy turns out to be a total jerk?
it seems he don't care.... if i were in your shoes, do the same way...
So, how do I do the start ?
Once more into the breech my bro!
It's like having your cake and eating it too.
...I'm going with One's answer....vote for One  vote for One
it is not always true though.
if you meet and know him well /for a long time, yes you could do it.
well it depends on how much you love her.
im a good girl but i have to admit that the bad boys definately can take ahold of you.
shower a gurl with all your attention.. then after a while ignore her.
I am very shy and so, I am not able to ask her !!
And sometimes I felt like I was having chest pains!
dont act crazy or stupid, just be yourself
Remember, there are no ugly women, some just are barely pretty.
for the same reason men don't like women have male freinds.
I'M A MAN, AND I CAN'T ANSWER THAT WITH SURTENLY.WHAT IS SEXY?
men alway want to be right, even when wrong.
do you mean how to get a boy to like you?
I never heard from him again until christmas day nearly 2 years later i learned that he had died.
just flirt with them and wear ome cloth that will make u look sexy!!
Bring a red rose and go somewere that she likes
and some taste better then others.

If you really love her that much, ask her to marry you.
I have plenty of men friends and we hang out.
id say go with your heart.. thats the best i can do ..

I dont think not emotionally ready covers it.
My b/f is jealous, it's funny.
My GF and I we're together for 5 and a half yrs.
he is obviously keeping things from you.
for once in my life i wish it will change!
I just have to get to know a person to like them in any level.
You will never know, its a chance u would have to take if u are willing.
im in the same boat, i have been dating a guy for 2 weeks.
you could type in his / her yahoo id and search for the person.
Breath a little bit deeper once in a while.
as if they dont even have to accept it.
Looks like your in a hard spot and it also looks like hes in a hard spot.
-- OK, so you aren't my student...but same answer.
I used to feel the same earlier...
it depends on how the date went
You wanted equality so very much, now you've got it.

Go out with friends and talk.
if you're not together .. NEVER!
cheap-check.com they can make a different types
i just wouldnt do it myself though, but is it wrong: in this day and age, hell no
cuz they h8 being wrong... thats how my bf is... lOl
if you like some one you are gooing to have to help her whith anything you know.
If she wanted you too it was wrong.
After thoes years, U be with ur lover by understanding each other
so as not to regret anything.
i don't really think that 6 is that common.
not if you don't want her to be pissed!
support your daughter in whatever she decides...and does.
Wanna go see if Friday night?
I guess it comes down to what you consider love?
as long as he is getting treated just as well theres nothing wrong that at all
dude to make the girls like you do not act stupid around the girl that you like.
I THINK YOU SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE OTHER MATE IS READY FOR YA'LL TO HAVE SEX
Thats what most of yall men think about.
That would be suprising to me!
when hes hurt  or something be there for him.
Here smell, do you think it stinks???
From the looks of your picture, it wouldn't be hard!
in the mean time just work on bettering yourself and preparing for what you really want!

Or is that going to make things hurt more?
Yikes....he is quite the mature guy isn't he??
there is no way to break up with a guy and him not be hurt.
Fine, I'm like, if you don't want me let me know and I will bounce, it's not that deep.
Make it a bit more universal like 'No fear' or something like that
A great name for a punk band
be yourself with a little bit of spreading (being the best in you)
just im me with the right answer
Ask yourself this-Do I really love him?
where i cant find them :(
briefs!, I like to have the package next me
Also NO WAY will I go back to the way things were, but would like to be friends.
We have 3 children, a 15 yr. old and twin 3 yr. olds.
it all depends....i am a guy with a punkish attitude but down inside im a nice guy.
Well, I am not sure exactly what a surrendered wife is...
People always love talking about themselves even if they act like they don't.
I THANK THAT IF THE GUY IS REALLY IN TO THE WOMAN HE SHOULD CALL 1ST:) GOOD LUCK
yeah yeah go and tel her
Don't cheat, love your self no matter what and admire how far you've gone.
they could at one time have been a sl*t but have cleaned thereselves up.
Enjoy your self while it last!
do the best and as a simple man, bro!
And the next day, you find out that your relationship is over, from Yahoo!
BE FUNNY,TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING,AND THEN TAPE 20 DOLLAR BILLS ON YOUR BODY.
if not dont worry if you do or dont have a guy.
your are the forth who ask this question :(
or am I just to paranoid?
guys can never go wrong w/ a woman if they give her jewlery.
Women, you can't have it both ways.
...  and then they would still think about it for a moment before they said 'no'.
and you say your young too well if thats the case its kinda suppose to be like that.
start with heavy petting, move to cunilingus.
thats the first step, i suppose.
I love a man in Boxer Briefs!
that sounds really wierd and dumb but define what U think  an online realitionship is...
Most women will never ask a guy out.
you can check the yellow pages ...
I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, AND I'M KIND OF NERVOUS.
right after the date or on it
not in mid MI, Clare area
(Guys hate it when they feel that they are being nagged at!)
no because if you really love someone, how will you have room to be in love with anyone else?
why would u want 3 g/f's?
yes, go talk to your doctor.
Also remember that the wife is always right!
It is like losing a love one.
anyway,e-mail back when u get a chance.
disclose everything u want......lets make list out here
he wants to be able to watch football and have sex with his gf or spouse.
i can only find this poart of the quote...but im looking for the whole thing!
Your virginity is very special, and should be saved for someone you really care about...
try to go to partys and stuff he might be at.
there are lots of women out there that will be interested in you.
go at it in a church
Love is not sex - that is lust.
so remember not to rush it.
You've said it, but do you MEAN it?
11 with a card sayin that she/he completes the dozen!
Also a lot of people who don't want someone their with also don't want that person with anyone else.
Is two dozen twice as nice or is it just overkill?
Did you get off to it?
he said i could be a housewife.
If deep down he's a nice guy, it won't work.
now i got a job offer in a whole new state for a job i don't like.
DON'T TELL HER THAT YOU ARE PLANNING ON STAYING WITH YOUR WIFE , SHE WILL ONLY BE BITTER.
stop and ask her for directions or something and just start up a conversation
if ur family does like ur girlfriend and ur girlfriend does'nt like your family.
), her fate is already sealed.
because boys cheat on the girls and we know how it gos!!!!!!!!!!
That is a bad sign bro
love all, as if you are loving god.
Get a picture first and send her yours.
If that's their answer, they probably don't.
Especially when most people suck at it!
i think if the guy is in to you he should call at laest every other day.
What is a major reason for people straying...BOREDOM WITH THEIR PARTNER!
Nobody does, unless they're psychic or something
no, it scares them but later makes them confident, if not arrogant later on.
if girls wanted it as much as guys we wouldnt get very far as a society.
I never act embarrassed / ashamed to be with him.
dont be scared the color of her blood pumpin through her body is the same as yours.
I don't want any drama, i just want my dress back.
even he agrees that i m a nice , good friend of his.
if that is so.. tell her that reaching climax will not affect that.
That's how it goes, I guess.
FREE TO DO AS I PLEASE
I love this girl very much but i have no idea how to start!
Then he sits around alot playing Palystation 2.
you know when you know there no real way to say it just something you know
At an early age , well 16, I decided that I wanted adventure in my life.
And make sure she doesn't read any beauty or celebrity magazines!
Does it matter if he is what you call gay?
U DONT SPEND ENOUGH TIME ON YOUR KNEES.AND OR BENDING OVER THE KITCHEN TABLE..START DOIN IT!!!
you cant make someone love you.
I dont really understand your question that good but it seems like youve been attracting young guys??
but the ring on my finger is enough.
Hey and I said Oh, hi, C. What's Up??
i have seen this happen way too many times; get out of there before things escalate out of control.
i understand that and i respect him enough to not do it.
who care what they look like it is all about there personality.
Then again she may have intimacy issues, i guess u'll never know.
its hard to even find that these days let alone take care of a woman.
Could the ones you are trying to dance with be Hoosiers, bu chance?
offer little gifts seldomly and tell jokes to her.
My grr did the same thing, then left when I told her to get a j.o.b.
If you don't already know, ASK YOUR MOTHER!
Takes these facts and ask yourself, am I a freak, or am I a super freak?
Then that'd be perverted or vice-versa!
Depends if you really believe in love .
Plus I found out she just doesn't call people back very much anyway.
go to the member directory of all of the yahoo members
Maybe you should try some dating websites, like yahoo perosnals or someone other ones.
but we mostly forget that and let the bird runs away .
BC THEY LOVE HIM AND DO KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF THE MARRIAGE?
SO.. practically married, just no paperwork.
Eather through note or e-mail.Not unless she likes  it when u ask in person.
She was scared I wouldnt like it.
single mothers can't leave house.... or are too lazy
Most men are interested in younger women!
wht do u have 2 do?
but remember to keep your eyes open and dress nice.

Pretend like you don't know she exists.
because, after all, they are better than other people and they can get away with it.
no i think it,s a bad thinking to sleep with some you dont care about
my boyfried and i have been togeth for 6 years
Just about drove my husband crazy.
i would agree with wat nichole says.
they think about how good the women looks
just dont take it to far.
...They both know, and he is always nice to me, but she hates me.
I mean, I'm not even the one she said it to & I'm offended!
Never change just for a guy.
then call her and ask her if you guys can talk.
WOMEN CHEAT AS WELL, NOT JUST MEN.
if it wasnt, u'd just be friends.
not one of these sites that dirct you to pay porno sites .
Okey kids Listen Up...the waterfall with great....we looked great...But the only thing you could hear WAS THE DAMN WATERFALLING....!!!
Not sitting on their butts at home, for sure...
lol I was just kidding about last choice.
Some are okay with it, others are not.
No, there is little chivalry here.
trust me..i no:)or call him  he will want to talk... ;)
i said what ever you have to say say it now.
Although I think it'd be kinda difficult!
and your partner will not doubt you wether you are lying or cheating to him.
( if you get this message please respond.
every woman has a taste... no matter how clean they are.
I never cheated when I was married.
find out the things she likes, spend time w/ her.
talk to her about this beforehand.

e-mail him and say you have a surprise for him and them do something sexual
a marriage is both the hardest job you will ever have & the most satisfying.
You have to get yourself out there, have fun, and talk to girls.
Give me a call, Ok babe?
If you find that perfect man then let me know.
Don't let your enemy discourage you!
i would like to say, honesty, but that can back fire!
but now she looks sad everyday.
but thats only for outgoing people.
I think that if you have sex with 10 guys or with only 1 --it shouldnt matter.
!haha.just be patient, and pray to god ask him who is the best husband for you!!
Believe me, you deserve much-much better!
If you want your guy to dress a little nicer, buy him clothes YOU pick out!
She has to want it heself.
You can flirt with me at cold_dark_storm@yahoo.com
where did you get that, do you know..., nice dress..
i would have to say 2 dozen b/c the more u buys u roses the more he like/loves you.
because married men are more mature..they already know how to handle relationships and they have more experience
How long ago was the breakup and what were you so jealous of?
Im still trying to find that out for myself if you find out tell me!
Just don't let them get that close.
I always thought once people were engaged they were SURE!
i don't really want to start something, but i still have a grudge with her from four years ago.
Hey there,  nice to know you love the girl.
Your best bet, if you like him, is to flirt with him and then see if he responds.
love is a feeling but feelings are not love.
find a girl u want to go out with and without thinking much about it ask her out.
you might find on that u fancy and stick with her the rest of the remaning year.
love to see full big ones, pretty sexy eyes, not butch looking
or maybe hes never thought of you in that way.
i live in ohio and i dont see much chivalry either.
if u have summ thing in common use it
what would she do if her son were to really die.
He however, always quits or gets fired from one job to the next.
im not even sure how he feels about me.
Get out of the house once in a while!
THEY were the one to cheat, remember?
had anyone in love with 2 sister at once?
like saying all that suppose to change the way i feel about them.
Watch out for the sound on your....video tape...Better Luck too you!
Well...I love getting new jeans and/or underwear.
being married is becoming one.....you have to give and take
i think he just needed someone to feel sorry for him.
make sure that you are the one.
(I am blind in ONE eye) ..
If both of yall aint tryin to make it worth anything it wont' be worth nothin.
you get that felling in your stomach that when you know
the moment we see a gr8 girl, we feel we are in love, but then that is just infatuation.
if he is telling you he dosent like you , suggest some time apart.
he is not interested in your.
kempie.....what the hell is up with the train analogy??
like i said men think differently than we do, give him time he may come around.
there is know h thinking about it u just feel it.
It would be even worse if i didn't know the guy.
just say that u really liked her for a while and she will do the rest
well anyway, just don't close the door, give them a chance to prove their worth.
That other guy didn't answer the question right.
I know way too many really beautiful girls who think they don't look good...
... maybe he just has a sis who hogs the phone all the time.
Oh yeah, helps that I'm a hottie!
Yeah you know you are, jus go with it!
Yes and no, maybe she didn't get the message?
im only 13... but still... if he didnt?
it depends on the realtionship between me and her but mostly i'll not sleep if a little bit doubt
on the east side (pittsburgh) we eat at beto's its the best pizza you will ever eat

coz those who r the one who helped u to come all the way.
yes, it matters more than it does for a guy.
- and 'accidentally' bump into her.
He's young, and a young man- is going to be a young man.
Say im sorry bla bla bla bla bla do u forgive me?
When you can't do anything else but think about spending the rest of your life with her.
If your not having sex it because she choose this not you.
Sometimes you gotta play the game to stay ahead.
I dont get it... youre supossed to be wrong, you know?..
I keep thinking she'll be back.
and forget him, & enjoy your love.
try yahoo email search, for one.
People like and want what they can't have.
I buy my wife flowers every couple of weeks.
u will beable to tell them apart once u actually meet a mature guy which would be hard
Ignoring it doesn't mean that they hate you.
i kissed my date on the first date.
if a guy were going to ask me out i would like to know the guy really well.
i also have an infatuation for an elder girl.
if you have to ask, maybe it is not love
There really is some nice, single guys left out here!
Don't ask a girl out in a message.
so it basically means that if you want returns you have to take the risk.
And no- I'm not talking about sex, either.
Well, you COULD try asking your wife.
Think of things you know he likes to do.
why won't she ask me out?
disease...because innocent people get that too.
sorry i just want to know how many girls ever got this line or how many guys gave it.
Ah leave em alone...   People learn by getting bit....Hondo Lane.
And what if it doesn't work out?

what if you like this person.

try telling her that u felt in love but never tell her who ... then follow her reaction
Just remember, in the long run, which is more important: your friendship with her, or a crush?
That would be so uncool, right?
I only have 5 and women never complain.
I'm 27 yr old, 6ft, not white

i don't want a divorce or to live without/away from my husband.
Love is what makes sex great!
i dont want to get hurt either.
i no there are good people out there just be careful
mmm Well when you get older you will find out :)
What you need to do is learn to trust your man.
i still like having the door opened for me and i love my feminity.
Either case, you gotta let her know, wouldn't it suck if she got away because she didn't know??
I hope you get caught on asking that question...
Im sure he would love to help!
If you truly think he is cheating .....he most likely is...........good luck.
7 years are enaugh , to understand alot of things in life .

I cheated 2 times, THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE  Never Again Will it happen.
why not try to seduce him?
sounds like you should not be engaged.
BUT EVERY SENCE THE NEW KID CAME HE TOOK OVER!!!!!!
like they say, if you love someone, set them free.
lets just say i wont ever forget it
Hopefully she misses you as much as you miss her!
girl, i have been there done that.
more of the same stuff you probably already talked about during the date.
Good luck and keep your chin up!
they even want to marry me.
If you're not in love with her, then don't stay.
sound like a little single time is what your in need of.
Almost every state has great looking girls, but I dunno, I'm gonna say Texas
if you dont know.you havent had one and don tneed to worry about it.
just enjoy and go with the flow!
use your eyes and your ears and then you gonna find out,remember not all the ladys are the same.
Some men like to spoil their gals.
Even though I'm married now and not looking for anyone, I still laugh at the pick up lines, etc.
That's, like, so awesome, like, amazing & like, the best, and like, so sad all in one!
I don't think it is 'wrong' at all.
Picking up girls is not all that different.)
Sure it's not U like HER and don't know how to let her know?
She's driving you crazy wanting sex?
well if she has 2 sleep with every guy obvusily she a sl.ut so that means she has 2...
Just because you hang out with a person doesn't mean your dating.

I'm having fun but unfortunately I got to get going and I am happy thanks!
Just sit back and keep doing what you are you doing.
Nothing like big hair, fake nails, and lycra to get a guy going.
I don't know but someone tells you write it to me cuz I want to know to
Life wouldnt be life if everyone was prefect.. im not sayin what he did was right!!
also can you deal with the way he spends money?
Remember its for better or worse!
i dont really know  but i have the same problem
no, she's your wife, and she should know that!
if you plan on children, they'll need alot; prenatal care, baby furniture/stroller, clothes, food, etc.

idk wat is ur name sweetheart?
Some guys do not like this.
Try telling her  hey girl you look damn slim aa
listen to ur mind followed by ur heart
YOU NEED TO MAKE HER WANT IT DONT ALWAYS GIVE IT TO HER WHEN SHE WANTS IT.
God created man`s Head unlike womans- seldom it match- AND IFF?
But only if u can handle whatever answer you get.
or go on a date w/ ur husband or go 2 a concert.
What is it that they're lying about?
maybe she just isnt into you like you are into her...sorry
By the way why did he leave you?
when u could decribe the love so you don't know it .
that is kinda weird also he was being very weird around me those few days
Get a penpal thats a girl thats your age!
If your still in love why would you move on?
No to going to other girls.
(FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY...BROKEN HEART 4 12 YEARS.
There is no US law that says they can't.
if thats the case keep trying... thats how my boyfriend and i ended up together..
Its nice to get the family seal of approval though, so I wouldn't wait too long.
becuase you also have the chance of not gettig hurt and being happy
just watch their actions and listen to what and how they say things!
Dont let anyone tell you different.
13 Herb Bath) and get on  with your life.
hehe maybe u must get warm him first:P
this guy might want to kiss you but he needs time to find the right moment.
they just don't want to admit they were dumb enough to get caught.
I hope this helps and best of luck to you in the future!
*In Philly, I like the restaurant MORIMOTOS.
Well the guy I met kissed me on the first date and I thought it was awesome.
may be you good nature & good looking they fill better to live life with you
It's so easy to marry the wrong person.
i too got married early but we didn't have kids.
u have to find a real love than never care about being tall or not ....
Don't let yourself be hurt any more!!!
if he goes to a party, ask if u can go with him
no, thats true, i've had that too.
You cant make anybody love you.
And then you roll your eyes and sigh and say, nothing, and storm off into the kitchen.
Try a little trick I heard on the radio.
1st, you hafta be open with him.
this keeps happening to all of us (guys) all the time.
redefine hot girl.. i think girls that are mean aren't really hot...hokey?
If she's picky, she will not be happy no matter what you give her.
Guys don't pick up on hints as fast as women do.
(no dumb pick up lines but if you want one that never fails get a hold of me)
guys(not all guys) want it more than  girls because sex is more important to you, sex is your priority.
Well I like when girls have eye contact with me.
If you brave it and ask her, that's gonna be a plus.
but sometimes ; we live too long in paradise , until we don't feel it , any more !
whole new bunch of problems (ones people dont talk about in public)maybe.
if so is it better to have multiply orgasms or one big orgasm?
What did you like about it there?
If Demi can why can't we...LOL  Go for it!
if its there you will know but hold out on her a little
But that just my plug nickel's worth.
be yourself because will like u being urself.
That is all i have to say!!!!!!!!!!
In general, if guys want sex, women want romance.
personally i dont like a girl to have kids.
She & I wound up dating & then we got married.
Tell her exactly what you said in your question.
if u have a house or will someday have one get her something for it.
I am not a person for that like that u tell to ur boyfriend
If you want to talk let me know!
by the way.. he is very very very stubborn!
The one I know is loyal and I can count on.
[Unless the woman forces it ;) 'I have never thought of you like that']
i would call her every day  but not too much  so that i dont step on her nerve
this guy is just bringing home the drama y even bother?
I wouldn't take it to much to heart, just be happy in the fact that you're really hot ;)
2. do the two of you have experience in solving disagreements well?
Stay there, while the staying is good, unless they are abusive in some way, then it isnt true love!
How do you get your dog to roll over?
Why can't you ask her out?
if your into it then go for as many as you want and can get.
but you have to regardless of how hard it may seem.
I wouldlike to know your answere dud, question like that means you have something to say about it, right?

One night he called me on a break from work & was really depressed...just having a terrible day.
Ask her to get up and clean the house
The second rule - saying ANYTHING is better than saying NOTHING.
and i would say for you to do the same.
nothing i have read or anything, just my own personal opinion...  anyway, i hope that helps answer your question.
THEY ACT LIKE YOUR KILLING THEM
If you won't ask him why, then your wasting your time!
i would have to make his private longer...i ant gettin any plaesure if you know what i mean!
well, i am really out of it.
kiss them ever so softly look deeply into there eyes and smile.
BUT I THINK THAT I LOVE YOU AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW IT..
touch her face softly with the back of your hand
be your self and talk to her,then ask her out,
Girls love a guy with confidence.
so if she is looking around the room instead of you.
i then think you are a rainbow warrior.
dont worry their is a special place in hell reserved just for you for even thinking about cheating.
For guys to bond, they have to do stuff: billiards, bowling, drinking, partying, sports, etc.
i want to see aishwraya rai's toes
ask your mate..its only cheating if it would upset them.
i'll give you a tip though.
then he with to ntice you and !boom!
tell him to sit at home and you get a job!!
I want to be happy in my life and not miserable every day.
Music Pets Family Friends Hobbies/Interest Job Just her favorites in general...   Best of luck!

One reason (for me anyway) it really turns guys on.
If you dont love him, then dont lead him (or you) on any longer.
cause it's one way of being honest to him no matter what.
i suppose you could let him treat you like a queen if he thinks you are
And, I'm just getting started here...........
hope u got a good lawyer...lol
might be he is feeling lonely.
a soulmate is nothing more then someone that you want to be with for the rest of your life.
Or a gay women thinking a man is hot?
You left this question kinda late, didn't you?
if you feel you need a wedding... do it.
why you gotta be all up in my grille about my attitude?
tell her that ur father in law will watch over her
depends who starts it...if u did, an apoligy is nice, ..
But i think it is healthier to live a LIFE full of LOVE... after all, you go both ways...
I prefer blonde , and i don't know why !
Hi, I go to an Academy and there's a woman I like.
why arent u comfrotable with talking about sex?
just walk up and tell him
If he is not that type of man.
tell ur mother in law that she is safer at her own house.
yes,but on the boobs/tits only OOOOOOOOOOk!!!
A girl who is kind and honest and wants to make me happy.
why do girls dress like tom-boys?
nope..as long as your full time job isn't looking 4 1.
10 years ago, mine cost me $5,000.
i don't think that u should kiss at all.
tell this friend that he needs to get a backbone and ask her.
if you keep trying, she'll see you as a stalker and that's not where you wanna go with this.
Don't linger, get in and get out.
What if you two start working on it and she cheats on or leaves you for another man again.
HoNeST MeN LoVe WoMeN: THoSe DeCieVe THeM AdOrE THeM
You did the right thing... don't worry bout it ... u'll find someone else!!
lol what the hell.. were you drunk on your wedding day??
I lost weight.. but I was in the bathroom at least 10 times a day...
because he doesn' t want to spend the moneyon someone other than himself or he's not ready for marriage
If she still isnt doing it right...well, your call.
they, actually were jealous of my mother and I.
I actually went through this recently myself...wow!
Please don't think all men are the same- we aren't.
then u'll understnd the value of life.
If your wife wants more sex have her call me.Ha!
Yes mosdef you can get pg.
Thats the kinda thing that guys do.
Give him his freedom for Christmas!
She'll probably be flattered that you only want her!
move on its over post a pic and maybe we can talk
try to forget about the mean girls or those that don't work out-thats part of the game.
( I'm totatlly going to get kick out again)
I'M SURE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
ive kissed many women in my life jest go 4 it balive in yourself
How about 5, 10, 20, 30?
or go to a foreign contry!
The cats will get fed... don't worry.
Sorry that I can't help more.
well how old r u bc i might know some that does
This is your test question, and also this is my test reply ... ;-)
He just wants you to be happy.
he s in my class n a good friend of mine.
then he lost his job right before we moved here!
im only a freshman and im in love.
and at the end of the school he gave me a hug!!!
it doesn't matter if she loves him, or if her father wants them to get married.
Look directly into his eyes & ask him if he is faithful to u.
Did he think about you when he cheated?
depend if you have a hot body
or take her out to spend time with her at her favorite resturant.
Im coming at you from the cheaters side.
there..s no match.. r  u planning to hang out with the same girl..
it is not as easy as it sounds i know that but it works.
you will know when the time is right
i think it is okay but just dont over do it!!!
if you don't then someone has issues that need to work on.
It goes back to Do as I say, not as I do.
I DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.
what ever happened to spare the rod spoil the child and spankings in school?
Am I happy when I'm with him?
talk in a cool enviornment, afterall he is your father.
he said same thing like her.
no I never send Christmas cards out
You should be pleasing her and she pleasing you.
are you able to let some things go?
gotta agree with applejooce, just tell him
eeek... marriage your thinking about this too much.
anything that will make me laugh all night long...
old when i had my first kiss first real boyfriend.
Its the little things that guys do that clue us in to what you are thinking.
Though, we always talk at night(coz im working abroad) and takes care of the kids.
What is wrong is that YOU don't love your spouse the way you used to.
I dont celebrate x mas myself...  3 months dude xmas is over... LOL
lick her body starting with her hair till her toes
Try burning a cd with his fav.
Will you ever get drunk with tthem again?
I was just wondering, Am I in love?
I like a lot of girls too, and I want to ask them out.
Lots of gurls are this way.
Cant put my finger on it but going to see her really scares me.
can he look into your eyes?

People get married and think well if it doesn't work out we can always get divorced.
thats sexual harrassment, document the situation, get some evidence, tell her no, then sue for your retirement.
no, it just doesnt happen as often.
saometimes the hardest part is totally letting go!
you have to open for him the way to not be a shy
and both of them ok with it ?
And besides, I just popped a mint.
Yes i did think it was pretty slu***y but I am still married and havent had any problems.
I can go on and on with reasons!
No this isn't a dumb question, actually it's a great question!!!
Like I said, though, it's a hard question to answer.
Tell your wife before she does.
tell her youll leave her alone if she wishs.
i think that a guy should love his wife if his wife aggrees.
On the flip side, why does a woman nag as to where the guy is going?
that it may or may not help them.
DON'T HESITATE JUST TELL ME I WON'T TELL ANYONE!
A girl , i see , but i don't know , named moonlight !
email me back with more info.mandie_mo_of_co
There is nothing more attractive than a girl who's having fun!
no sir not wrong at all.
Should I Wait or Should I Go (as Wham sez)?
Many women always say they want a real man?
ask more girls til one calls you back ;)
and should i get her a gift?????
Do yall not like him for right serious reasons?
people that fit have better sex.
its happened to me like 3 times
I BELIVE THAT U CAN ONLY FALL IN LOVE ONCE.

When you feell like it is time... What I mean is that your hart will let you know.
Do you know the way out
tell him until he decides he wants a conversational relationship with you no s*x, usually works
Now men think their women are lazy if the woman just wants to be a mom.
Do the one thing that many never do.
I'm wondering how old you are.
If u don't love this person leave, but marrying someone else isn't wise either.
WWII Singer from the Jersey Isle in Britian...
dont jump to the assumption that u will definitely get hurt.
how would he feel if you were friends with ur ex.
Because a lot of men are looking for trophy wives.
Online relationship shud b there for online purposes!!!!!!!!!!
if you sucess then congratulate you!
sex is very important for men also money
look for guys that are serious about thier studies.
BOTH SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE FRIENDS.

And if it is--still no excuse to cheat on your wife.
sit down and think of it and speak up.

The kids get hurt the worst.
(Frankly, I don't like roses all that much!)

first off, you should get to know her, become her friend first.
Magic 8 Ball says:  Ask again later
if you find your love winds down for even one of you it probly just infatution.
for the upper answer... a player @ 42 years?
why do women feel as though men want to controll them back at you
She still wants a relationship with the guy, that's pretty obvious.
If u dont ask she loose her for ever so dont waste time my friend.
you should ask youself some questions before beginning a life with someone.
cause your partner trust you that you are not deceiving him
If I don't marry her she'll leave me.
for some reason guy round here feel cause they like you, that u should automatically like them back.
some just like it that way!!
gift cards are the best way to go with anyone these days.
Who's to say, just go with whats comfortable for you
a good woman woudnt do that.
If I ask him out then i'll pay.
ALL YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES no matter when or how long it has been...
meams ur pretty dam good-lookin', if ya have 3 g/f's!!!

Hi Sweety, Well not all women do but I guess most do.
Is it really worth it to cheat on your wife.
Think about this your are saving the best for last!
have fun, and do not be afraid to discuss and ene try new things.
likes guy stuff (sports, etc...) and can hang with the guys and make them laugh.
I did once just for fun.
just b/c you asked doesnt mean you do or dont.
if u love him, can talk to him about ANYTHING.
Oh yeah, and if you're a girl...it hurts like hell the first time.
if i guy can't accept that, then he is not worth your time.
doesn't the other grrr deserve a chance?
yeah because parents like 2 screw ppl up
And if he says no, then that's just that.
but too difficult to wait till marriage!
Not to be rude or piss you off or anything, but it sounds like she still loves her husband.
H E L L O :)
That's quite impressive - 90 a day and that's just ONE service!
But I assure you......never stop looking.
something u can have with me that is if u are over the age of 18
my condolences go out to you !
When you move, keep your phone number unlisted and get a p.o.
how do you ask a boy out?
if they belong to you, they will come back.
Because if a girl chases a guy, he feels cornered.
well it depends on the guy how old is he how old you are.
Words don't mean much...actions speak louder.
YOU DON'T TRUST HIM AGAIN CHEATING IS DISGUSTING.
But, i asked, and she explained.
who knows maybe u two might go all the way!!
give her all she wants and more......
SORRY TO PLACE YOU IN SUCH AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION.... SHALL WE CARRY ON NOW??
yes it's bad...you should be desiring each other all the time.
you won't know until you try
Flowers or choclates and you can always get her some earrings man
Wow... thanks for the kind compliments you fine bunch of wonderful ladies!
If your a 30 yr old dude LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE!
Sounds like something my friend is going through right now,, he needs help but you can't do it alone!
flirting can lead to a lot of things just dont let it do that...
maybe she got bored with ya...expected some things outta ya, and you didnt deliver..wake up, that happens
If so then you are in love.
actually the average size is 5, so it really depends on the genes.
you have nothing else to loose.
i know a girl like that ,   and i try to stay away from her
But still shouldnt be that big of a deal if you know how u feel about that other person.
mtv also has an influence on girls too but hey thats their problem
Then he will ask you y u r doing like this.
Some things are just not meant to be.
how can i get over this person easier, and is there anybody out there that needs a new friend?
Look up their phone number in the phone book?
whether that is worth trying, or even possible, is up to you.
u will never know if he likes u unless u ask.
Dude... it as easy as reading your letter...
because it would be wrong to ask him to break up with a girl that he just got with.
give a smile, or do something which makes her laugh at u.
i'm sure another girl would appreciate u better!
Because he wants to hammer you grrr, don't do this, don't you remember what jon said in the 80s.
Something clicked like magic, and it was like I was in heaven!

Marriage is not about what you get man, it's about what you give.

think of your kids first..they dont need abuse in their home.
So men learn that I can do what I want and lie and she will still get over it.
It's like slamming your finger in a window over, and over, it feels good when you stop!
Acutally I like Cats answer, it's prrrrrrrfect:)

no i always hate my sex life!
a man who cares for you, loves you, but it is hard to discribe cause im not you!
That said, I keep it real and I always get a ton of attention.
i broke it off, it was hard, but i dont regret it at all!
blondes......... coz they are beautiful and stupid
MARRIED ABOUT TO BE DIVORCED BUT ON NEW YEARS EVE I CONSIDER MY SELF FREE.

AND HOW DO WE SNAP OUT OF IT?
No, unless u like a  person who is like under 18 & ur way over.
her name is fur immer liebe samsonellen.
how could u forget look on the license
Get her to eventually ask him back to her place or something similar.
get her close to orgasm and when she tell you to stop, stop and get away.
Hope you can understandme... Everything is up to you, just think a little about it.
See if he finally gets the message.
ALL THE STATES HAVE GOODLOOKING GIRLS AND WOMEN EVEN THOUGH ALOT OF PEOPLE ARE TO DUMB TO SEE THAT!!!

Now things are really messed up.
And add a good Pick Up Artist online resource.
how much dating did you do ?
And let's talk some more o.k.
That even goes for a 18-year old dating an 17-year old.
its a bummer, but they can get away with it most of the time.
cant really snap out of it until they do something really stupid and out of hand.
And if it doesn't work, it just makes it that much easier to get over her.
Isn't that wrong of her, or what?
Your in High School you should be dating a lot of people not just her.
make sure u really want it.
Sit back and peep her out.
because they can be....now go out and fin a girl that doesnt poop on you
just get it over with.and try to be sincere.
not really its usually the other person has something you don't have
having sex with other people not in the relationship and the partner not caring and/or doing the same thing.
because there is no such thing
someone who cheated is probably deceptive... they will lie and say they don't know why, when, really, they do
Please give me some tips so i can have a orgasim when ever I want!
or put an azo pill in her soda to make her pee orange.
welcome to the 21st century, dave!
And the second and third from what I recall.....
If he thinks that 100 is not too many, then hey, you’re like a virgin.
do you love him for who he is?
goto switchboard.com and put in the there address
Worth looking for if hard to find.
Are you dating younger men just to play around and they get too serious?
But it's not that big a deal, when you think about it.
no more than 12  no less than 5
goto switchboard.com and put in the there address
Worth looking for if hard to find.
If you can get over that then your str8.
LEt me know if it works.
u tell him,  so you are really serious,huh?
just because you want to get back together with him.
YOU COULD JUST E-MAIL ME THE MONEY GIRL!I COULD GIVE YOU MY E-MAIL ADRESS DO YOU WONT IT?

!If you don't like it, then move on to the next category...duh!!
I am afraid that she may get angry ........ or she might not like me ........
Don't pull away too quickly, and if he pulls you back in....you know he likes you!
depending upon.. who is and how the date went..
I noticed that i get attitude towards guys who for some reason unknown to me wanna holla.
But that first time in love stuff just happens when you first fall in love.
i think cards that would say, one free back scratch or one free massage or one free kiss.
Yes, I think its really bad !!
they're everywhere, you just have to identify which is which.
Well if your family is anything like mine.
what can I do for her?
go with the flow cause maybe he is just scared to be in love.
I guess u just have to date until u find the right one.
Don't mess up a good friendship.
ummmm.... i don't think its romantic i thinks its gross, but also farts are funny.
what if he/she didnt like you because you had, short hair...etc etc...you see?
this will be an investment for u for future
YALL JUST THINK ABOOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS WITH IT.
Showing your love is all the little things that you do for someone you love.
what if he/she didnt like you because you had, short hair...etc etc...you see?

love = koigokoro  you  = temae  so it means that u love someone in chinese language
YALL JUST THINK ABOOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS WITH IT.
Showing your love is all the little things that you do for someone you love.
HE IS CONTROLING WANTS TO MAKE YOU THINK YOU OWE HIM
LIVE*LAUGH*LOVE ITS AS SIMPLE AS THAT
its not the best situation to be in
if you like the person why not?
Ask yourself, is she worth waiting for, are YOU willing to wait?
Start checking out other guys, let him know how it feels.
FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD AN AFFAIR , BUT THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.
Nope not at all unless it was only sex and even then make sure you protect yourself.
Because people get married with divorce in the back of their minds already.
First of all, don't let him know you are thinking about leaving.
He buys me whatever i want, but he doesn't want me to do anything for him.
if have not already found out, make sure shes single.
but women see it different than us men.
just go up to him and asked him out.
Britney Spears Ass or Carmen Electra's mouth!
If I'd had the choice I would say YES, without thinking twice...
now if she is just being polite and not interested in you.
I do know one guy who met his wife that way!
I've cheated, and been cheated on.
Just look at it like this... men expel and women retain!
some other guy to come get her at YOUR house wouldent you get a little jelous
u kno they could be sex addicts.
im impressed by a man who doesn't try to impress me.
So she has to turn a lot more guys down before she finds one that she likes.
Frankly, its not that big a deal.
If hate is amiss, it's like a funny smell in an elevator.
i said how many do you drink.
for me it is a felling u can never put in words
you will definitely know if it happens... its too intense not to notice.
If he looks at other girls when you are not around then, O.K.
(unless u don't mind other guys banging your girl)
it depends on if he really really likes u or not
either u have a good figure or u r extremely beautiful.
I like a cool chick with a hot ass.
3- You find a good girl and you don't want her to marry some one else.
I THINK YOU ARE MORE LONELY THAN IN LOVE.
WHAT IF HE GAVE YOU SOMETHING.
i'll take the brunette please    thanks
Go to USA if you like an american girlfriend...
if you have to ask, then i would say no.
cus they are bored and don't have anything better to do...
If you're thinking of asking someone, but not sure, just DO IT!
and if he stalks, call the police.
u just have to marry him to know HOW husband he will be.family life changes everyone.merry x-mas
Many, Many girls (and Guys) prefer a uncut guy.
but you must enter his full name.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO SEE HER TOES??
i think you should be bold anough and ask him
i have never heard this before.
And legally you can't do anything about that.
I LOVE HIM BUT I NEED TO MOVE ON, HE IS MARRIED,PLEASE HELP ME, I AM SO DEPRESSED.
cuz everybody got a freak side to them.
no cry-baby whining stuck-up prissy high-maintenance jealous back stabbing hoochie like most women are.
the limits are but u cannot hold it till death i think :P
quit nagging him and get him a beer.
She needs some attention from you sweetie!
Best of luck finding the right answer !!
anyway if u really want help on this mail me to acriyaz@gmail.com ................. bye - ac riyaz
because they are insecure dweebs and can't handle a real woman.
Just don't over do it and go straight to the next girl if she does turn you down.
jest look to her eye :)

its in the people search section.
to an extent... yes it does.
she refused you once... meaning you two werent really together?
and is she as a freind more important to you or this guy you like?
I tell u this from experience!
if u trust him, have met his family and i just pray.
She expects from a boy to do things,,about which she is thinking,,,got it???
when u missed him/her when she /he is gone
2nd, he might actually respect you, like most guys dont, and doesnt wanna ruin a good thing.
nice guys sometimes are too attainable.
cheat while she is buzy cheating u
he's looking to cheat on you.
I don't think it is wrong.
I didn't realize how sick I am.
Show her you are a nice caring guy.
Like french kissing and makeing out.
small claims court...if you got proof that they have it?
The answer is: No, there is not a chance with him.
yea..besides a tree some men would probably like some polo boots for the winter..really depends on the age?
and have kept a freindship since her divorce.
Did you try to turn around?
To ask out a girl you like, don't sweat it or practice it over & over in the mirror.
Usually women like this will give it up to the man who doesn't buy into their BS.......
LET YOUR FRIEND DO AS THEY PLEASE.
plus it always kinda hurts when a break up doesnt affect the other party.
yes...and if you ask real nice...he may give you someTHING extra!
i haven't heard anything about them.why don't you ask them?
what if she is really mean/crazy?
arcade, go cart riding, bowling, play pool
Perhaps she is thinking the same thing... how can I tell if he still loves me?
any where i perfer some where nice
i say no because if he done that to you once it will probably happen again.
Because you'll always come back to him.
or you could just talk to him!
and if she likes you to she will understand.
it might be that your wife only had cybersex but that is still sex.
I need one for a guy that I like alot.
the whole saying about...guys mature a few yrs.
So flirt one of 'em and you will be in love.
a gravitation force which pulls u
girls never go for sensitive guys.
I would take her with me, then go hang at the mall, but I like Richs answer best
If u still have problems file an complaint and reverse it to them!
I certainly wouldn't do that to just anyone.
Why do so many people have sex with other people that they have no intention of ever marrying?
My husband got me a leather jacket for our 5th Christmas!!

WHY YOU ARE LOOKING FOR free DO U HAVE SOME MONEY PROBLEM?
and finally ask him why, what does she mean to him?...will it happen again?
no,she might dump you because shell think you want to have it with her and her mom.
or if you meet her at home she will need to look for a vase to put it in.
i jst wont waste my time.

You could just hang back and see how she handles it...
He is most definitely a LOWLIFE who SUCKS!
does the cock size really matter?
Actually I know more women than men that way.
Most of the guys that like big girls a really skinny.
This is tough because of what you said...you're still in love with him (how long were you guys dating?).
ignore the ones who said alcahol.
well u never know ur luck so there might be a big persentage or a little one good luck!
THEY ONLY WHANT ONE THING(-----)NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A FAMILY.
and don't listen to those other bogus answers about maybe he wants to wait for marriage... thats not true.
IF YOU KNOW HE FREQUENTS A CERTAIN CLUB OR RESTURANT, JUST STAY AWAY.
easy rule of thumb:  you sleep with guys and if you enjoy yourself you're  gay.
I like answering these kind of questions!
Or do u love what he was and what he could be, if he wants?
Just as some women do, and some don't.
not downing anybody, just trying to constructivly think here.
In a woman: long hair, nice legs & butt, small breasts.
But like I said the best advice is TIME.
He will not care about it.
you have my confidence good luck bro.
My question how do I go about this?
I am a girl and I am not.
guys are guys and the jump from one topic to the next.
you have my confidence good luck bro.
And kinda watch over the whole situation...
My question how do I go about this?
I am a girl and I am not.

I just had sexual relations over the internet with some other random guy.
And flowers...there must ALWAYS be flowers:)
One guy was really creepy and scared me.
or use yahoo personals  i am looking for a part time lover too.
But that they do not want to have children with you or marry you.
Plus its just having fun with one another and pleasuring one another.
Well, first off ask him if he is.
you just know if you like someone.
redheads with a fine sexy body.
If she doesnt set this guy straight then maybe you should say something to her...
I really like this girl but im too shy to tell her.
most girls do that maybe because they have a crush on them and you want to impress him.
Just remember a life long commiment is just that, life long.

Head it off at the pass?
Go go a blog sites..like yahoo 360 or msn myspaces thing...give her a link...
I agree with catnip... my mother never care any of my BF's business.
the smaller it is, the lower your self confidence, the worse your performance.
Hey dude... wake up and smell the coffee.
go out with friends not necessarily males but females
keep ur personality high and don't do it .... your r too high-class than ask such thing
maybe point out to him if you see someone kissing.
Family In General Division - Ew no!
just go whatever the best that you've had think!
And He didn't try to have sex!
we met 26 days ago, and im willing to have some more days together with him.....
i would say good just keep looking
How can I get her to love me?
Just don't go overboard with it.
the fact that you even put yourself in the position to watch her makes yourself a cheater!
If he likes women older than him, he probably likes a mature woman.
don't forget to use your ears.
No matter how cool and charming they are.
it seams like he dosen't trust you if he is jealous, i wouldn't
i first started dating at 14!
In fact my girlfriend does it sometimes!!!
I've actually never used them, but my realionship couldn't be better!!
friends friemds or she may be someone u allready know
When did i stop doing that?
men are hunters, women are nesters.
You know i get the same crap from my friends and family.
when you find out, you let me know
tell them that you like them.
Remember any guy can sweep any girl off her feet- he just needs the right broom.
That do u gurls look for in a guys personality attributes?
it wont work out...if he cheated on ya once, he will again
its because she doesnt think anybody would like her in the flesh.
deadma lang pag sumunod p din deadma k uli & tell her the worst of u
Spending time with friends or keeping oneself busy (NOT by cheating though...).
sorry but your are still a child!
GOING OUT DO YOU STILL USE THAT EXPRESSION THESE DAYS.PLEASE DO ME A FAVOUR AND DONT ACT SO DESPERATE.
did he spend time with u at least on that day?
Hey baby... Do you have a little (insert ethnic group of speaker here) in you?
For the same reason men do!
ya its a good idea, just nothing too expensive, under 20 bucks should be ok.
think about the world of problems that alone opens up.
Hey, I have a crush on you.
Good Luck... Hope he kicks your face loose!
Oh, men are just strange.......So simple....Yet so complex..I think every man does it at least once.
My big brown eyes and my boobs... yes they're real!
Finally...remember the way you get a gal IS the way you lose them.
I want her back.... and that feeling is not going away.
if he invites you to do something with him and/or his friends.
Is she in love with you soldier boy?
I saw it with my own eyes.
most people these days look at physical stuff.
WOMEN CAN BE EQUALLY AS GUILTY AS MEN.
That way she can get what ever she wants.
He said that if I died, he'd kill himself, so I humored him and said, Ok.
LOOK FOR SIGNS THAT SHE LIKES YOU.
Other people are drawn to that and you'll have more friends than you ever dreamed.
Once they are mature enough though..
Then smile, peck him and give him a big hug!
And then,  get a big piece of paper and write I LOVE YOU!!!
Most Girls only look for the wallet and they are idiots for doing so.
thats the only solution until you're ready 2 move on
I wouldn't go back out with him for one thing.
maybe you guys could have a really strong relationship.
Don't mess with the other girl's boyfriend.
[whew got tired writing that last sentence.]
you can have one with out the other.
This is your best friend, your lover and the one person you dream about going old with.
She is 18 and she's a big girly girl.
From parenting Q&A:  Q: Is it OK to talk about sex with my 12 year-old?
For the past two weeks me and my bf wasnt clicking like we use to.
if you've been dating a short time, she probably isn't interested in you anymore.
once; if they are the one, you'll know it.
ITS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD if it goes wrong.
Brake it to her gently that you just don't want her to be in your wedding.
Ok then do you have a job?
knowing you can spend the rest of your life devoted to that one person.
I heard Raz B told that to sister to sister magazine.

DUREX, unless you want a sensation of a broken condom :)

but then kiss him and such.
This is the way families are established... Go ahead and be happy, you two!

Men who are best friends are friends because they trust eachother!
take a cruise you can find cheap if you book late
Really give it to the Salvation Army

Use manners, so many people forget that lately!
dude as long as ur not loud and they're asllep just do it!
Ever had the girl you don't like and have made fun of and teased suddenly be crazy about you?
TRUE LOVE IS WORTH WAITING FOR,HE SAYS THAT HES WORKING ON IT, GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
but with love with eyes closed.
And before you ever get married always get tested together.
Look, you can't keep a woman that don't want to be kept.
coz guys dont think twice b4 going for it ..
If the love you have found hurts then, baby it's not love!
And the cultural and religious differences; we won't even go there!
why god set my mind when i cant get him.
well it depends, especially for me.
I say this because once you cheat once you can not stop.
the more she treats me like shit the better
Men see that as criticism........even though you so don't mean for it to be!
yeah....i like this one girl and i only have 2 classes with her
Said he tried to kill her with IT.
who cares if you kissed another girl?
when we were kids we plkayed that game.
your gut feeling is usually always right.

Please specifify if it's a gf, wife, stranger, friend, etc.
i thnk u must give more time for ur relationship.
I went crazy and bought my boyfriend all sorts of stuff the first Christmas.
hey i think either is just fine with me but i prefer bad guys.
); to me you're taking a chance both ways.
If he is so far gone to say yes, then you know it is over anyway.
and when is sex too long (after 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, etc.)
Is Gay what your intersted in?
Try this, but whatever you do, be very genuine don't be fake.
or if it doesn't brake up with him.
usually during the first date the guy tries to impress you and something goes terribly wrong.
You just don't know about it.
Could be that she is shy.Why don't you give it another chance and talk to her again?
Some men are sexier without hair.
when he feels comfortable with his gf.
ask a friend to do it for you.
I could go on and on about this, but to sum it up the answer is HELL NO!!!!
No, men just think that women answer questions like that.
i had a great friendship with a 37 at the age of 18.
Try to have any details about her!
if its respectable and mutual, its a beautiful thing.
YOU'RE 15 THATS A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR SPANKING IN MY BOOK.
because they want to impress them
Dont give her too much space, because if you do, thats mostily going to end up bad!
Try to have any details about her!
if its respectable and mutual, its a beautiful thing.
YOU'RE 15 THATS A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR SPANKING IN MY BOOK.
because they want to impress them
he said no that means there is no womenly instinct matters.
The first love it the hardest to forget!
it didn't work out for us.
So I told him that we should be friends.
tell him though you are not a stalker you just felt like saying hi
or did she give you something.
So tell my why do guy do that?
I guess men just get caught more.
But hey.. it's a unique thought!
(Just have to say though, that calla lillies are awesome and you can get them in LOADS of colors)
or did she give you something.
So tell my why do guy do that?
I guess men just get caught more.
But hey.. it's a unique thought!
(Just have to say though, that calla lillies are awesome and you can get them in LOADS of colors)
Porn n : creative activity (writing or pictures or films etc.)
we're just waiting for the catch!
Man I have the same problem!!!
that he's a disrespectful bastard that likes to get smacked in the face.
So i feel u need to move on and still rember your kid.
If you are religious and don't believe in premarital sex, then don't do it.
Yes, but make it a coupon for a blo-job or something like that
Hey, sometimes you find love where you weren't really looking for it.
If not, there's plenty other fish in the sea baby!
Someone whose not scared to cry.
The bad boy image sometimes girls like, but I doubt those relationships last too long.
I'm not that kind of guy and I think that guys that are, are cowards.
To young to date or be in love!
they might be feeling the same way and want more too.
Hope you find the right one.
before he goes out dress really sexy so that he can't go out with the boys!
how does this make you feel.
It has been 37years now and well...what ever?
if she fell in love, well, it seems hard.
You're not engaged (yet)...so there's really no reason to worry (as of yet).
I think it is wrong to cheat.
there are two ways of cheating at a modern day.
try getting a girl then taking her picture.
But if you want sex with him, too.. then talk to him all you want.
If you want extravagant, then $20,000.
SO GO & KISSSSS YOUR LOVED ONES & ASK WHETHER THEY FELT CHEATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RELAX AND IF IT IS MEANT SHE WILL COME TO YOU.
(FYI: not putting civilian guys down) Good luck hun!
I guess ALL men need is lovin and nuttin else!
no REAL man waits until marriage!
Do I REALLY want to get married somewhere else?
If u don't cheat her, she will also never tend to cheat u.
somebody said to just do it within 3 seconds.
(If she doesn't pull  away then she WANTS the kiss).
WELL THEY WILL PROBLE HAVE A CELEPHONE IF THEY HAVE A PHONE THEY A PROBLE BE CHEATEN ON YA.
it's how tight the you know what is.
how much you should spend depends on a few things.
So now everybodys happy but him!
My answer: (pssst...is it in yet??)
Do you not have grounds for divorce???
Or is it that you want to be the female version of 'The One'??
or wait until u get to know him better to tell  him about the kids.
Just don't get 'em mad by getting them drunk!
IS THERE A HEART TO LISTEN TO OR JUST A TEENAGE PUPPY LOVE?
if someone did it to you and you didnt like it, then why ruin someones marriage?
Both the girl I dated and her sister are very beautiful.
get a bass boat instaed, you'll have it next summer.
Use it and get him to loose the hag.
if it doesnt stop report him to the authorities!
in  relationships i find making out wonderful, then the last base!
love is something that two people share.
Not weird, just don't let security catch you!
ask him to pick u or her.
he supposely likes and we hold hands and he flirts.
try courting..but dont be too fast,take it slow and be a gentleman ofcourse.
then you'll be happy and he'll be all yea!!!
Well that all depends on if you want your family and friends there.
and so wht if u get the girl, he's just haten
Us guys are so afraid of making the first move...so go on knock his socks off!!
now he is broke and pissed off all the time.
beside you marry him and your the one who really proposed.
Baby or Hunni...she calls me Pooh Bear, Boo Boo, Her slave...etc.
yes go for it you love her
so take a step if she doesnt say not yet you have a go ahead.
think long and hard, do you love him.
IF THATS NOT AN OPTION THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES
it depends what hes lieing about
That would depend..are we talking years or days?..do you love her?..if so ..yeah why not?
Let her know you think about  her.
I found a girl that I love.. and I love her for who she is.
it seems small but it means so much!
What can I do to get her back?
love is a thing which everone do's.we get stuck in love
i fell good when i am with him but soon after i feel bored....
Don't pull away too fast, and if he pulls you back in...well you know you got one!
1st of all- don't marry him.
She said hes just a friend, even refers to him as her homeboy.
THEY NEED NO EXTRA REASON TO KISS LOL HAPPY HOLIDAYS !
Ask yourself this question...Would YOU want some other guy to try to take YOUR girlfriend away from YOU?
she didn't cherish your love like you cherish hers.
is it to make love wit somebody?
I'm pretty sure they wouldn't do that for you due to all the pain you'd be in!!
they prefer them with back hair instead
if you're OK w/ Women's Lib, & Girl power, & that stuff, yes.
ur girl friend had not accepted no.
My boyfriend wanted to have a baby and get married, but changed his mind... too late.
Maybe he thinks ya'll can get back together.
it probably won't for you if religion is a major factor in one of your lifes.
I guess you mean relationship with gals like sex or love, from their bf or husband.

other bitches call my house 24/7 and i have to tell them off.
you can do it but thats nasty and your kids would come out all wrong
The list is too long to name
but sometimes its not so n iam sure one can judge the best him/herself
Hi Kat, you have to be safe with this one.
I THINK NOW MEN AND WOMEN CHEAT FOR VARIOUS REASONS.
Why not say it if you are not married if you really mean it?
your questions dont make no sense!!!!!!
yes, go to the courthouse and ask for the paperwork..usually its only about 200 bucks.
Do exactly what your heart is telling you then.
If you didn't have sex with him.
grow some nuts and talk to her.
Guys don't really care too much about birthdays like women do.
If he already in love in other don't distrube him and search for other guy.
a woman will stay with a man no matter what anyone says if she loves him
I want a baby badly too, but why make myself miserable and poor by having it now?
Although guys rarely take girls back but girls seem to take guys back.
make me feel happy and free
I don't think you ever stop loving your ex.
LOL  Kinda like a caveman gene.
as far as the two of you are willing to work at keeping it that way.
i think it is a turn off only because i dont like the way it feels on my face.
Funny cuz I have that problem but I try.It helps some though.
but if your wondering why lesbians hate you, youve already answered your own question.
All its doing is asking for is trouble.
I call her my meali'i and I am her po'okela.
Hey...you wanna go back to my place, order a pizza, and hump?
ask urself these questions...did he have the money?
And if it doesn't, just be happy being happy
If you like more things about then go for it.
*> BUT THATS COLD NOT GIVING YOU SOMETHING FOR YOUR BIRTH DAY.
i'll create one and give it up...wait
and presto u'll have ur love back.
If it works out, great...if not, no loss.
because they are friends and family ?
NOW THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE
most people at my school know im gay anyway.
Did it work, (even if it was for a laugh) and why?
i think he just left elementary school, w/ F's in every class!!
i feel liek i should do something.
Lots of things to think about if you're looking for life!
Im 17 and shes been with me since i was 8 i think.
its illegal and the 20 year old should be put away
Oh try it with the lights on!
When men talk to men they rarely lie...
Because most guys are wussies around women.
One I just never hit it off with.
I hope u liked it and use it i really think it sweet.............
If she can't see what a wonderful person you are, then she is not the one for you...
show (dont tell) her that you can fullfil all her need and want!
i really couldn't tell u what it was but all i  know is that its fun...and feels good!!
without grabbing her arm or stepping to her to be rejected.
if your mother thanks its ok tell someone else.teacher,nurse at school.
BUY HER WHAT YOU WANT HER TO HAVE AFTER ALL ITS THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS
she will if ur nice to her and do things for her and dont be an idiot to her
whiles standing infront/on the phone with her, of course...
nothing it just makes the illegal, legal
but carry on, love and be loved!
My sis and bro keep bugging me and I keep asking them to stop bugging me.
y do they always forget important dates unlike us women
if i see a cute woman, how do i ask her out?
I got divorced and went broke... she didn't care...
I have no real advice, because I can't do it myself.
he sounds like he likes playing mind games to get girls crazy about him.
they say it is a mans ego but a woman she is a hoe.
don't no girl want to weak a$$ man so u can't be a punk about it.
blah and then call only once a week?
maybe going to the beach , somthing interesting and creative.
Once again trust me it work
but unless you fed up dont break up ask him why he dont give you gifts.
You need to go somewhere you can talk and just hang out and have fun.
Don't deal anyone throwin' curve balls at you!
Unless u can't afford it then don't bother... lol.
though he was honest, it still sucks.
Just be careful, a lot of guys are users.
I don't know, your the one in love, right?
SEE I BROKE UP WITH THIS GIRL AND THEN IT BROKE MY HEART
well kill them with kindness has always had a funny sound to it.
BUT IF ALL YOU GET IS PROMISES AFTER PROMISES, WATCH OUT!
its a friend but you can have sex and its ok = )
try to listen before speaking you might miss out on somthing inportent
and if you love the girl the age doesnt matter is all about feelings...
Someone i like, attracted to, who shares my dreams!
yea it's possible.kids sometimes don't come out right
Best of luck in your search.
I doubt Einstien knows the answe to that!
be yourself  and be confident and don't let a other man take your luky woman from you GOOD LUCK!!!
Yes, guys never mind girls asking them out.
if you reali like hem yes you Should try to get my boyfriend back
so you should probably do it in his bed.
people are crazie bitches these days
But I do enjoy it more when I find a big guy.
to give ugly people their first kiss
if you want to have sex use your hand.
YES... Hope it worked for you, I've discovered that they suck anyway.
An ice cold six pack and a good game on the tube!!
he prob wants to take it slow or become friends with benifits?
b/c in the end you will all get burned if you dont.
You just have to wait on her, she's out there.
Ain't that a great news !
It's like asking why don't women find bald men attractive.
lol you put the peepee in the vagina and hump hump hump
the same reasons that men cheat on women... personally i wouldnt know.
wow my friend is going thru that mmmm but she 16 mmmm adoption is the best
And don't be too nice either - we like guys who are a bit bad :)  Good luck!
Try a country bar... there are a lot of them there...

So she asked for the moon.
yes, but it doesn't last long.
Well it wouldnt be as special if you didnt write it yourself now would it
Dont worry you will still find someone who really is in love with you, just keep looking.
thy looking at it that way
So even though it's not easy move on.
it means he is still heterosexual and still alive
get her something she can use with her husband.
oh my god, do you even have to ask that?
i think most people likes  to have a christmass gift

You don't want someone that reminds you of your dad, that would be kind of creepy.
well i believe in love at first sight but some are just a mere infatuation as we call it.
not if thats what you enjoy and you like the moment... and regret doesnt come.
just forget it and save yourself the embarrassment.. trust me.
he just expressed his loe and he has every right and what had happened man.
yeah i wood probably say yes if u were nice
i finally wised up and left.
You're not married to the guy right?
If she gets mad she wasnt that good of a friend afterall.
then again after our third one.
hmmm,sure u did not misspell kamasutra coz we're going into a completely different line of appraoch here,lol.
open for guys and chics to answer...
is this like love at first sight?
when u think ur mature enough to handle the drama that comes along with gettin involove with a guy!
your heart cheated long ago if you are kissing someone else
i appreciate n agree with above answer

There once was a man from Nantucket...  lol
if u really like her, do something corny, like her fav,fruit she'll nerver forget.
Now I'm with a person I totally trust and I couldn't be happier and the ex is happier too.
The heck with that guy he is a two time loser.
figure out what it is you like about both of them - and decide who makes you happiest.
If you do it online your just getting a little help.
(then eyelashes; bf has really long eyelashes and IT'S DEAD SEXY.)
JUST TRY TO STAY OUT OF EACHOTHERS WAY.
unless & untill ur penis enters that gir's vagina, u r virgin.
& if things dont work out just tell urself i was 2 gud 4 him newayz good luck.
who knows, you might be a spoiled brat who needs a good whippin'.
Its depends if they are not phycho's or stalkers.
women are individuals...just tell her that you're simple minded and have her tell you outright what is wrong.
Tessa, you took the thought right out of my head!
what do they say size does matter?
I only say I love you when i mean it.
( watch the movie walk in the cloud)
Now, did I try to fight it?
And instand of u being the one looking for the girl,your the one gettin look for.
Depends..are you materialistic and shallow?...if so then YES.. if not ..NO...life is too short for trivial things.
some people spend the rest of their lifes together without ever saying i love u
Don't tell her - SHOW her.
Some guy walking down the street saw it and said You are a gentleman.
nooo star wars is over rated and thats crap!
LOVE HURTS BECAUSE IT IS REAL.....
how old are you and why do you want a wife
just act like it doesnt matter and you will be cool.
Yes wait until you are married!
and definitely dont be a jerk if you dont want to be slap!
if you want to call then call.
with words comming from your mouth!
I don't know what I am going to do either.
some will tell you to forget about him, but i no thats hard.
Actually, even thinking about someone without your partner knowing is cheating.
Hi, my name is <insert name here>, what's yours?
Your avatar is bald, so I'm assuming you are, too, and I wanted your bonus points!!)
make him feel like he is the man!
Use people-talk openers like 'Do you know Steve?'
And you said I was a loser.
Talking about cars, cell phones, & buddies, negative!
shown how important he thinks it all is.
Tell him something like, We shouldn't be doing this.
I threatened to put more garlic in his food if he didn't back off!!
I wouldnt go down on a girl thats stank.
Find a distraction - school, work, X-mas shopping (just no subsance abuse, OK?).
Most women I meet are married, have b/f, or have 5 kids and can't date.
yeah unless your related to them or they already have a girl friend
don't even try, he will see throught it.
In other words, its not like you just went out & turned up pregnant.
give it up, girl you deserve better!
under 25-30 bucks but is my favorite gift yet....
hey babe ping me on coolnishith2000@yahoo.com.
I'll pray for you.. God bless.
AND IF YOU ARE, DO HIM A FAVORE, DUMP HIM.
I don't see anything wrong with this but how do I reason with them?
i would hang out with friends and let him wonder where you are and what you're doing.
Get over it and do your homework!
for some, it feels like falling.
TO GIVE ANYONE A REASON TO KISS EVER NOTICE THE HOTT ONES NEVER STAND UNDER IT THO ??
the guilt trip, the unsureness, it's all difficult, especially when you've got the mind of a girl.
love simply flies away when hunger knocks.
take him out for pizza or play sports.
looking for a woman to date
I guess to put in just one word---kind.
try to meet his relatives or someone friend who love him and make them as a mediator
Nope the speed of air comin' out is toooo much
I mean you can think a girl you know is hot.
11 real red roses 1 fake red rose i love you till the last one dies
We're not best friends, but anyway......
Go to a gym (they're working out, and it's coed).
I just realized you said how, that's good.
Then...no one else will appear in ur dream
You need to find a guy who actually cares about women ^_^.
try it out my TOP 5 -- it works.
Every time I look into my girlfriend's eyes, I can see the beach.
Perhaps ur not as snuggly as yahoo ans, where's he now, why r u on the comp?
i dont think they all do but i would guess that a bunch of them do
so she left me high and dry.
re you willing to fight till the end?
If you truly do want her back, then you want her to be happy no matter what.
You're not cheating, you're just outsourcing your orgasms.
You probably can't do it without offending him.
remember actions speak louder than words.
it could happen to you too.... just put yourself in his shoes and judge yourself!!!
yes som time ilike to be alone
that was better than a man
Avoid worn-out party pick ups like 'Do you want another drink?'
its like a trampoline...  only two can be in the air and one is bouncing
this is my first year ever having a guy w/ me for christmas.
Sounds like he just wants to have sex with you.
:)  Just remember it's the rest of your life, how much do you love and trust each other.
you kant expect neone to love you when they dont,,, keep it cool dude!
My ex-girlfriend and i where alone at my house.
Your father will eventually come around trust me!
Takes a long time to know you are a somebody & stop accepting anything less!
well talk to him tell him to choose cause you are settingyour self up for hurt
i have been with the man i love for only 9 months and we are getting married march 25,2006
When the time is right WHAM ... you got hit.
Don't tell her she can't hang out with him or you've already lost.
my mom asks for a list every year so we get something we want.
STOP LOOKING SO HARD AND SHE WILL COME TO YOU!!
makes you feel like you didnt matter.
dont u think we love our parents, grand parents.
just forget that you had a very bad nightmare.
tell him everything but the cheating with a friend part
Yes, long as you dont have it every day!!
yes you should stay with him maby time will fix it.
If you like her and you feel shes interested yes.
it frowns on women who just want to get freaky.
like in my case, i dont mind doing laundry, but i HATE folding clothes and hanging them up.
Of course thats about the when i started liking people.
But it would be great to marry a girl/boy who loves u and viceversa.
If you like empty parking lots, then stick with them,
he knew it wasnt right but he didnt want to be alone.
so i hope what i said helps!
I even don't know if he is alive.
You just learned to french kiss.
it would&#92;could be awkward but i think i would rather have a girl ask me out
I dont think its harmful at all.
Definitely clean, that freshly showered smell, the smell of soap and water and clean clothes...does it every time!
AND THAN IF THE OTHER BITCH IS THERE YOU AND YOUR MOTHER KICK HER ASS.
invite her over and pop in a porno
men are individuals just as we are.
hey i wanna be your friend
I'm sorry that guy was such a butthole, no woman deserves that!
Try Dooney & Bourke- they have some cute bags in the $135-$150 range
I don't care what anybody says, somebodys gonna lose a trailer.
tell him/her how come its over/gone.
so ask urself wut is luv.

if you wait too long, you will have over thought it.
maybe he wants to be friends but really would want it to go farther but isn't ready yet.
THE EYES, THE WALLET AND THEN THE EARS.
But if he's not, dump him.
it don't need any third party applications
Get hurt physically or something else?
How do you get back at a cheater?
actually i think that one of the states that start with an 'i' does marriages for gay couples
me and the guy broke up and his friend asked me out tho afterwards.
That along makes me not want his sorry ass.

If you whine he'll think you're a b****.
depends on who you are doing it with
and ofcourse a sense of humor.....chocolate and wine never hurts!
And, of course, they are young men...they want sex.
if he's afraid of committment, then i don't know what you could do.
THING'S MIGHT CHANGE ANY MOMENT FOR THE GOOD.
love is what u make it.
you just try to forget everything good, and remember everything bad.
I Dont Know, And trust me I have had sex before !
and how much total you have to work with.
Ya if you live in Alabama hahahhahah
if he gets nervouse around you and says stupid things.
Take 'em to chuckie cheese or whatever 5 year-olds like now.
suppose he's a duck hunter...buy her some waders.
Lose him, and don't give it up.
and you know that he is a married man.
It is like you are kissing their..................
And I know shes been hanging out with him lately.
SAy somthing like hey ya want to grab somthing to eat?
Try setting her up on a blind with a guy with some morals...
cuz its not about him or u its about us (the both of u) make sure its real  ps.
You got it all wrong, hon!
when you feel hurt, that means, you care for that person.
and, i have to admit, after really good sex, you get a certain feeling of primal possessiveness, i.e.
Some people are into it and some are not.
no im one and i wouldnt.
Um...no, unless you want to go illegal.
Some people are into it and some are not.
or else he is dead....either way, he's gone!
no im one and i wouldnt.
Feel good that you just did it!!!
Kaely thinks you are a dork.
totally i ask for naughty things all the time :)
If it worked once why not again?
But it's like any other group of people, compatibility isn't always easy.
My work here is done, toodles!
Then you should GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE!
Just give it to him straight.
Be there for her in the good and bad as you always have.
What this do is make the girl want u more because it become like a test for them.
Or, if he does like guys, jump his bones!
moving on, being happy, screwing his friend, becoming lesbian, please give some good maybe even funny advice.
OK Cupid has lots of strange tests and matches you with people based on them.
Family are generally a pretty good place to start...
i think you should keep trying.
and the woman at home cat must aint good to him anymore.
Lil hugs and kisses touchin thing like that.
why do u need a free girl fiend???
its true, most women want to know that they are...well wanted, and sexy.
let her know what you were thinking from the start.
Is that what you are asking?
im sorry i thought u were gay
Or an average looking girl that actually cares about other things other than herself.
maybe try to convince him you want a lot more than just a hook-up.
all for one and one for all.
I had an ex who cheated, lied, etc.
don't let any kids see your dirty little christmas list!
You just have to keep looking.
Further u need not to tell, he himself will tell U.
This is how the whole gettin a girl thing work, girls like nice guys as friends only.
Hi,   I am Kong, some call me King.
Remember there are plenty more fish in the sea...
BUT if you do not mean than you should not say it.
people try to hard and usually end up with something they dont want later on down the road
Someone out there is going to find you attractive no matter what you look like.
start bangin someone else .......she is most likley
Now it seems like just an ordinary, everyday thing!
Do you just not like him?
Then you won't have to worry about the label, you'll be Husband & Wife again!
Even if he's not gay, it doesnt have to mean it's cheating!
Don't bother dating, just renew the marriage & MAKE IT WORK!
i think that u should talk to him about it.
i did once, many years ago.
So... yea.. it just all depends on who the person is and how honest they are with you.
No gift, thats a big mistake.
If so, weigh out all the pro's and con's (make an acutal list on paper!!
You can't have it both ways.
you'll never know unless you ask.
If you really love him you wold reconize that size doesnt matter
dont worry hell come to you.
I believe that some do, some don't.
how do you know that if you get with he won't do the same thing to you?
if it doesnt make you happy why are you doing it.

I knew how to keep my apartment neat, did laundry, etc.
Think of something he always bugs you about when your around.
Beyond that, it's freakin' nobody's business!
they always think the grass is greener on the other side.
what ways can u give a guy pleasure?
would you do me the honor of bieng my wife?
Belive me, what ever you decide you can handle it!!
I don't know a guy anywhere that would like a poem unless it's about beer and boobs.
just leave be honest and straight up tell them that its not gonna work.
like emails and stuff like that?
If she Acts like that, You probably shouldnt be friends with her.
some want it every day and some want it twice a month.
and the toucing things have really impoved.
gals cheat less cos they scare being cheated by the guy she try to cheat.
it sounds like you love the person but feel that they dont love you.
turn-on..intelligence, sense of humor, great teeth and smile, tall sexy man, men cologne  turn-off..sarcasm, ignorance, bad hygeine, materialistic, unemployed
So sex it up, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.
Life never turns out the way people want it too.
the love they deserved to have
When men talk to women they have to lie a lot...
as a catholic i say after but as a hott lonly chic is say before
But, u marry ur life-partner only.
When you give of yourself, and allow yourself to love, and the other person just isn't there with you...
Find out what it is & try to accomodate...it might help in more ways than you know...  Good luck!
His favorite television series on DVD ?
without getting turned down and painfully.
they aren't as complex and tthe just need to get over thir ego.
what does this have to do with singles and dating?
buy her a K&N filter charger for her car!
first ask the basic 'w' questions: who was she?
Whatever you do, don't give up your friendship with your guy friend just to make your boyfriend happy.
can you guys please tell me where is a nice place to have fun... san francisco or lake taho...
For the same reason that women do ... ask any lesbian!
It might not be that you are a loser at all.
U find what your not looking for.
we rnt suposed 2 meet people here....thats stupid
quite frankly nice guys arnt taken serously there more looked at as the brother type not the dating type
if your a guy, 14 and with the teacher if your a girl, 21
so, be honest and try your luck!
;)  Seriously, if you don't want her in, don't ask her.
Than well the rest is up to you :D
It would probably bother me if he didnt.
of course u can love a person even if you are not married.
so, be honest and try your luck!

i would just walk away do it just walk away and the ghost might not hear you
I gotta argue with that one.
hopefully you aren't too old or you are screwed.
First you have to get yourself busy.
Anyway we all exagerate don't we -- let me know how it goes - info@ianjennings.com
Show her that you took the time to make it special.
shouldnt be that hard they're easier to spot :P
Cause if there is one then it will be plenty more to come
this is you just heve to wait for her
if you are a starving artist...don't spend 300 dollars.
The true and honest love always win!
I want a man with confidence.
Heck.. you just might find Mrs.
you do not have to be married to say i love you
high school (according to my brother).
It means I'm just not that into you.
fight ur urges friends are worth more than cheap thrills.
my muscles and my eyes girls go crazy for it   wat r your three best features i'm curious ???????????
have u gotten him anything for his bday?
if you do tell her dont go into great details, mostly the mom part.
Moral of the story, don't be something you're not... be yourself ;-).
Do the I don't what to screw up with you line.
SO MANY THINGS TO DO HERE IF YOU SPEAK PORTUGESE..
Yeah, but dont show him that you really really like him then he might freak out!
Have you ever asked a girl out?
plus if she lets you lick her feet then you might have to fulfill her weird fetish too.
Wow, didn't know I could go so long.
is there some unwritten rule about the girl never saying i love you first?
depent how deep you know each other.... about common interest and a lot more....
yes it is ok to fall in love with a young single guy
even if the man isn't gay, it's not considered cheating.
And I'd strap on a six shooter and make her call me Tom Selleck for spite!
but shameless flirting never hurt anyone.
Ask him if he is gay?
Maybe you just haven't found the right girl or maybe you haven't noticed the right girl.
you can tell him its over thats what i do
with the following words coming  out of your mouth...would you go out with me?
Well you might have scared him a bit, especially if you  got something expensive.
Mine is Doc and hers is Kimber
Dont feel bad, my son is 31 and still single.
GET OUT AND SMELL THE COFFEE.....
that way, they can leave without any problem.
This one doesn't care about you.
just tell her, or write her a note.
Is it because, I'm a giant gorilla and she's a woman?
in other words, if your dating a gigalo, don't kid yourself into thinking he's prince charming.
all I can say is you know her and what she likes.
Get ready for an odd little story!
no...it doesn't matter the size...it definitely is how you use it!
IT'S A FACT...I CAN DEAL WITH IT...
well personaly you need to pick.
If there is nothing you disagree on can you just file and be done.
Well guys in a nutshell are assholes.
But if he treats you or the baby bad then I would say NO!
Also when we kiss no matter how badly I want to or he wants to move we dont.
Well I don't see why there's such a fuss over sex before marriage.
Maybe she's got her eyes on some other guy and you just stepped in her line of vision...
if you hurt all the time then you need to find someone else.
And trust me.......you so don't want to mess with her!
Oh mothers........ where did that come from?
maybee you dont know what lonely means
and anyone that says they love you would never put you in harms way.
If you love the woman get married.
coz u have it in ur ID catchme.
Get to know the girl...no matter whether she's larger or smaller, if the connection is there, looks won't matter!
She may just like you back!

good cute body & style & their face & ec.

You just have to guess and hope for the best.
out to dinner and then go have fun and do something like bowling
sounds to me like someones being led on.
yuo ten to get peace from praying.
I don't want her to be in my wedding.
Well, whatever you do, don't have one of your parents call to break up with him for you!
i will know by; the care and feeling she shows around me
And if they think they are, it's a very good indication that they aren't.
is only foolish men who cheat
find out what she really wants, and be that if you can.
not unless he has no desire to talk to her.
its frusterating, but then again...a blast!!
Tiger: Don't listen to any of them, they are all wrong.
Sry, yall- this is like my 4th post.
stop wasting your time and his and just leave already.
There is this guy i like and we are kinda dating but we havent made it offical.
Now I just get him things he'll have fun with.
Becuz, We are trying to train you to do wut ever we want
you dont need someone there making it bad.
Personally I run down the street an get me a Big Mac and get my tummy full/
maybe he just likes you and is trying to fill the void?...
Most of the nice gals are married.
I THINK THAT AT THAT AGE, YOU ARE JUST BEGINING TO LIVE.
but i wouldn't try to impress her by being just that b/c relationships aren't all about humping.
If he wants to be more than friends with her then he won't tell her what you said.
ost ladies like when a guy can aker her laugh.
freekin punch that so called friend in the face then ull feel warm and fuzzy inside!
or something cute and simple like a teddy bear or even a poem!
Most guys will get over it.
ignore him and forget about it....revenge is not worth it
I like clubs because they are loud and women always go in groups.
to some women i`m in between it kinda matters it kinda doesnt matter
OuT TO DINNER is always good....but dont take her to ur house...take her OUT
He cheated, how do I get rid of it?
Yes, and she became my wife.
if u like a girl dont dont dont get to know her as a friend 1st.
girls do that anyway, whether they are conscious of it or not.
Wait till you find the right one that you love!
and you can start a conversation.
you canalways step to him first
your perfect guy will come at the perfect time
5th: u don't care what they look like or anything,and u can't name y u like them.
And oh yeah, wear something short.
Come on guys, we are not picking on you, its a known fact!
and if you really want to get to know me call me at 307 351 2765

When she keeps flirting with you.
Come on guys, we are not picking on you, its a known fact!

as a girl, I'm gonna say it's pretty hard for me.
When women talk to women they lot a lot...
from that it self you can tell how she is being true with you?
THAT'S NO REASON TO DUMP A BF.UNLESS YOUR A MATERIAL GIRL.
sure she does...until he gets bored with her and moves on to his next conquest.
women  had self esteem by being a good mom and wife.
?and why would you want someone who can so easily be taken from the guy they are with??
if still can't tell write him a letter.
then blurt it out like a joke.
is there something going on with them?
its a big step especially with a shy girl.
I gotta have it all, love and everything else.
Some men freak out about that much responsibility.
but there could be tons of possibilities why she is like that.
But i wish I did Maybe because we're so different and always trying to impress one another.
It's just a feeling that starts in my gut kinda thing...
perhaps your scaring guys off... good luck to you
So I don't know what to do .
no baby i see its free good
Gvie her time to feel 'at home'.
only you will know if he truly loves you or not
get her a gift card so you don't have to worry about anything
Oh BTW, I'm not really that butchy, kinda in between..haha...but anyways, just had to add that in there...
im a man, i like it when my women shove the boo-ahs in my face
Ok, this is something I know about, this is all I can say, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.
true true...  it comes it goes and no one knows...
She doesn't play, but I do.
I would become a sex master, after that I would get married and teach my wife all about it.
So, they had sex & the woman left him.
danceing, then go to the moves!
Right, no, but is he really blowing you off?
regarding what is wrong w/ him..... unknown.
But some are into big girls.
but then if you just happen to see her and liked her then you could observe her actions.
fyi... he's sitting behind me answering questions as we speak.
that magic only exists in fairy tails.
they seem so happy to talk among themselves and nothing else???
I see too many women like this ALL THE TIME!!
If not, that sucks but at least you'll know, and she'll be happy.
But all in all do something different.
and some ladies wonder why there isn't a faithful guy out there.
First, if he loves it...respect him.
Wear something sexy but not slutty.
its a way way of showing love like any other way.
!Ha Ha Ha!I don't mean that.But go to blind date,Yahoo Personals, or Google personals
I still wanted to send it to him but I never got an response.
pretend that she does not exsist.
try asking him for a reason.
just go for it...even though i think u should start from 8th grade and over
Once there keep in the center of the action - don't hide in the kitchen etc.
STAINLESS STEEL SET WHICH WILL BE USEFUL FOR THEIR DAY TO DAY USE .
Should I tell her now, I don't want her in it?
You dont you each have to move on.
Girls seem to pick each others b/f's.
Firstly - there are plenty men who like bigger women - it's all a matter of personal taste.
wat he does is his thing.
I cannot go back to someone like that can I?
He will probably cheat on you again.
Now she is talking to this new guy and I found out that she's hanging out with him.
There is so much more both of you have....... take the time to find it.
i don't trust these online poeple search companies.
I, my self have been told don't look, she will find you.
I saw him naked with her.
Lets kiss and find out  ;)
If u look for love u never find it.
I will tell you a secret..
Call me for more Questions at 307 351 2765

Move on and get a life.
and next time don't be so stupid and say things that you will regret.
GOD SAVES THE BEST FOR LAST
(at the end ask him if u still could talk about it personally to make it formal... =)
That girl is a little bit my friend.
But don't give them that i love you stuff because thats a turn off from the start....Be confident!
i don't think there is any thing wrong as long as u luv that person
talk to her in loving manners, but dont be too pushy.
Do what ur heart tells you.
I can't stop thinking about girls that i know , Is it okay for me to have sex ?
(What if kids aren't even possible?
SEX & ATTENTION -THEY ARE TO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT THEY WHANT.

ive planned only a few but my input is 7-10g's.
Pass on him some hints of ur liking.
something she will love for ever   merry christmas   ...... comeing from the haert
If you love this guy, it doesn't matter.
when you are mature enough to understand your own feelings
Yes, he's been cheating on you.
i know what im talking about.
so tell him and then start making a list.
no, but i would be-friend them!
And that your friends are ONLY friends!
I hate the short hair for girls.
your own hand, or your sock?)
Why can't MEN stay home and watch SPORTS on there home TV without his friends..??
I dont think men should hit women at all.
why not stay home and talk!
If you hurt someone like that then you dont love them.
it is if you can't tell your girl friend/wife about it.
not all girls like rich boys and some like fat boys i hate the rich type.
well there are probably websites for that.. they are plenty of single woman though.
who know he may doing something nice to you?
GET A LIFE AND DO YOUR SCHOOL WORK
buy  a red cheek poweder to increase shyness cuz shy girls are amazing
Don't bother getting too upset with this.
It depends on if you ever plan on meeting
one has the word word in it and the other has the word note in it
Come on.....everybody has at least one insane one.
and make it very clear thats what you want once you've got him on hooked.
It's not that guys don't want to help.
let him know what you feel.
Chances are  He will be back
The wallet is a plus though =)
I know it sounds kinda stupid to be talking to yourself, but it really helps.
send the kids with your spouse.
or anything else for that matter?
Of course you don't want to pay.
man, am I the only one to do this.
Well, when I stop talking about it & do it right in front of him...loudly...he normally gets the message.
That's not horrible, it's just practical.
WEll if you dont want to flirt ( if your shy especially ) then don't.
Just think of it as a boob trifecta.
or is it just a thing to u?
girls don't want a guy that they can run over.
I'm thick and i've never had a problem.
boyfriends and girlfriends come and go but your true friends will always be there for you.
23 is very young and you have a lot of growing up to do.
Can't go wrong w/ a single rose
Well did you boink the guy or what?
my parents don't like it my mom sayies well if they make you happy and my dad hates it.
now i have a man that i am seeing that would never even think about another girl.
see it for what it is.
i sounded just like you not too long ago.
tell your girl i bet she will think so too.!
does it mean to trust care and respect somebody?
He's an ex because he's an EX...no more!
If I cheat on my boyfriend because he never puts out?
probably he likes you but something is holding him back.
Hope that helps, rock her world for me bro.
As for those that don't.. it's their loss :)
Well mainly it is just him.
If your asking that question than YOU ARE GAY!!!!
because they might like you and dont want you to know things.
Do anyone know what I should do?
They also don't like men of other races and colour, but you know what?
People at school think I am a nerd
second none of my lesbian friends hate me, they just dont find men attractive.
until one comes along and they start beggin and pleading.
if you dont feel hurt, that just goes to show that you dont care about him or her.
Tell him that you don't want him to do that anymore.
is this the kid of relationship you want from a boyfriend.
NO---as long as they have an orgasm ---who cares how much u weigh!
you dony hsve to move to africa, they are everywhere.
Pick one up and give it a try!
i really like him and he asked me out last year before we did anything i told him no.
Raising kids as a GAY IS wrong and immoral period!
Good luck with the boyfriend & happy holidays.
Why not he just might be Mr.
y bother in the first place..
i guess the only consolation to that is honesty.
i no thats how my friends are but i don't lie i'm already good.
Us women are no so complex creatures really....  Good Luck!
If he says no and you believe him, then there you go.
How can I forget it all in my mind?
Why don't you just ask her and then go from there.
Sounds like an excuse........well, you can always kick the kids out somewhere.
give her a nice and simple gift she'll love it
If your love hurts... let it go.
WE MEN ARE INSECURE...REPEAT AFTER ME.
move on,, if she wanted to find you she would have...
just be charmin and sweet girls like that
If they are just friends, he will tell her what you said.
?....gee, If it's his, he'll know..lol
1st consider getting a dictionary so that u r able to spell the word anniversary.
What's so funny is he's 20yrs.
a guy who really cares for you will make the time to call and say hi.
do you forgive him and stay or do you figure it as a love-crime and walk??
stupid question, try writing it better.
He just want to use you WHENEVER.
I LIKE TO THINK THEY WILL UNDERSTAND AND PROTECT YOU.
so plz take right step and gv deep thinking to take any decision.
Didn't you promise to love honor, etc.
If you do not mean it do not say it.
Tell me how things go .
If you have to ask, she probably is.
there's nothing really bad flirting to a guy.
i did not like kissing men or haveing sex with them.
I'm a guy... and teh poems I like most are limerick poems...
I pick it up and just stare at it.
Then, hand the girl a drink, even if she already has one in her hand, say here, have another.
never do a movie on a first date.
(that's even more modern in thinking).
let her know that you would rather leave then to cheat because you care that much about her.
One day they want space and the next day they want a relationship!
but identifying it is a whole different matter
if she freaks out around a firearm, i wouldn't want anything to do with her anyway.
For some one to say 'I LOVE YOU they just need to love u.
give it another try, sometimes it takes time, if u like em dont give up
choose one from ur neighbours house man an denjoy ur holiday with her.
But most women prefer it to be just them two.
Dont waste your life over one girl!!
SHIT I WOULD DATE THEM BOTH.
First of all, what kind of guy says he would never ***** as you put it?
think about it..but before it- smile please!!!!
Look around, grab whatever tickles your fancy and have a ball.
yr going to be with 1000 cats and rats if dont stop it
because they think that there is something that they are missing.
ya got to love getting older.
you deserve someone that will only look and want you.
BUT IF NOT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO A GRANDPARENT OR GREAT FRIEND.
I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND
Now I'm with a girl I totally trust and she and I both are very happy.
just dont show that u like him.
first u make it sure n test him thn u must take decision to brk off.
Just don't let him pressure you into stuff you do not want.
of course I would date outside my race.Everybody needs lovin no matter what
I want a fat and hairy obese woman that belittles me im public.
DO U HANG WITH YOUR FRIENDS?
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE AM I IN LOVE WITH HIM NOT DO I LOVE HIM.
Do the household chore she hates most!
Don't let him and he won't.
say hey momacta let me hit that
you probably havent been looking in the right places dont worry theres someone for everyone>
take what you can from it.
you may not realize it but you men are just as confusing as us women!
Till then, you hang in there!
It is all in your hand
It's not a good thing to date your ex's sibling!
It depends if she likes you too
if you guys are okay with the religious difference, then marry.
Go look up some e e cummings  There's tons of good poetry that guys like.
i am not this way, but my husband is.
some men are just stuiped like that
But lil mamma it is doable.
personally if i were her, i would want to go to a movie and then go out to eat.
Just spend some time hanging out.
Just accept him and be friends.
He usually buys stuff if he wants it, so he doesn't need anything.
I don’t like him, he is no good for you, or you can do better than that!!!
ya do what you want it is your life
It's ok to be afraid, but don't let that stop you!

Now think whether it could happen with your ex...
be a friend dont let your feelings for her get u further away from ur goal.
feed that person that should keep them quiet for a while
; ) That should shut them up.
I love sleeping with me wife.
If you have to ask yourself that question, then there's a good chance
I love him so much and don't want the flame to die.
Trust me having sex after marriage does not mean your not cool, weak or even stupid.
becuz they had it with someone else b4
but just remember, it does matter
tell me if u found an answer
I THINK THAT AGE AINT NOTING BUT A NUMBER.
Me, I'm not sure if I wanna get married any time soon...I'm young and with little experience.
I have a feeling shes seeing another guy but i'm nt sure.
But this is only my opnion okay..
so that every night he has to lie in the bed that his girlfriend and bestfriend had sex in.
I look to see what keeps her going from day to day.
give them a hint or flirt a little then tell that u like him/her
No your not a bad person you just have needs.
I wish i was that lucky
then you need to set a budget.
Yeah, good thing I like twilight zone music
IF HE IS NOT WORTH IT.
When I told him movies, carnivals, eating out, a concert, he said So, you ARE all about spending money!
and he won't already have a mrs. right.
dummy that was a dumb question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Because men lie just because they think they can get away whit it.
Best advice is just not to ask guys out.
i don't think its true that lesbians hate men.
I agree, there is good and bad... Just get to know them.
it gets more detailed but this is just an overveiw of it.
give it to me if you dont know what to do with it.
my friend wants to know (maybe that friend of mine is me...)
I'm in one now and straight LOVING IT!
If you just want to play but aren't the serious minded type - tell her that too.
Then I toned it back a bit.
no that's hot...   what's up sexy?
a person only has one sould mate, one true love.
Matter of fact, me and my boyfriend'll meet ya up there cause we're gonna get married too!
just tell him/her honestly how u feel..... or don't let her/him to feel you spirit anymore...
because there is no one good enough for a true nice guy
go pink girly girls love pink, and butterflies.
slap a libel suit on her ass
I think u got the question wrong.
what  the  hell   you  talkin  about
we are not the same as even a few generations back.
But don't waste tons of time doing it.
But always communicate with her, and if she loves you, she'll brush this guy off...
because they are from two different planets!

i wouldnt do that to my beast freind  if iwould do that iwould confese and say that iam sorry
fox theater jan. 1 2006 playing?
you should let it go and be friends justlike she sayd.
If you're so interested, why don't you ask him out?
If not you will loose both.
U should buy her a   Underwear !!!!!
When they ask me why dont i get married i just say what for?
Too bad you don't have an Avatar.
Try and get him to realize your not cheating first if that dosent work DUMP HIM.
Don't worry though, there are people out there who don't cheat.
no offense but she doesnt sound too interested.
There's also this: guys just don't like bushy privates.
I hope Kaely Lykins likes me!!
yea cause cause i have 2 home girl and we r
no offense but she doesnt sound too interested.
There's also this: guys just don't like bushy privates.
Like mouth, just lips, just tounge, etc.
I hope Kaely Lykins likes me!!
yea cause cause i have 2 home girl and we r
it depends on how she feels if shes stayed for that long i bet its good to get married.
have fun, but don't date again, not until you're 100% sure you can't get him back.
it is a guy thing..don't fall into that trap..take control..and you call the shots.
if they are single, they probably want to stay that way.
I don't understand why some girls like those guys at all.
Get a puppy, or watch the American Pie movies.
if i were you, just ask him in a flirty way like are you checking me out?
But my friend playa to playa if you get caught up in the mix.
(at least that's what it sounds like)
So, why would we only love one man or woman?
try to get everyone to care
i dont have any boyfriend so can't tell u anything.
but secretly they were still going out and i didnt know.
this is my most embarrasing moment  leave comments plz.
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK THEN JUST ASK HER.
there is no amount on love.
we danced together and kissing, we didnt talk much but we feel like we talked so much already.
Why so quick to throw away another marriage?
I would also add...  a kiss !
set a date.... and go from there
she is a sick woman and shame on her sorry
I hope one day there won't be a need to ask this question!
dam how do you not know that?
why hell no.. he should dumb you for being such a shallow bitch
There are a few things that I just get SO tired of asking about & I get annoyed.

nope dont think all men cheat.
Take an ice cube & crush it with ur feet & say now that I have broken the ice......
If he is cheating on you and with other girls then tell him what the problem is and leave.
i think that you could go to the movies.
Go out and buy something sexy to wear (even if you just wear it around the house).
So explain if you want advice please ;)
if you wouldn't marry them...don't date them
coz it very easy to say but difficult to stay on words.
So there is only the girl who wants things differently.
ye love can be at first sight
If it were me, you'd be packing your bags and hitting the road...
How you r treating and trust your girl friend?
You call but she does not pick up.
if he didn't find women attractive, he also wouldn't have much interest in you!
Guess what, I lost my incentive to do these things.
And also about playing with gadgets.
and dont act like a stereotypical floozy.
figure out how much money you will have total.
If they say no, that's it.
i have a friend that lost his dad last year, you just got to calm him down.
nothing gets a girl going like horsepower... at least it works for me!
Why don't women like short guys?
i dont know what to do
It is online dating, not line dating...
If a casual friend is asking they are just making conversation.
IF SHES WILLING TO AS FAR AS THIS, WHAT WILL SHE BE WILLING TO DO NEXT???
Yep and there is nothing there..just this empty space between your ears
you don't need much to turn a guy on...we are always on
i think that is the point of the drug..not to just stay hard but also to last long
I know lots of people who use it, and at least some of them are looking for relationships.
dont let your relationship go bad.
....  because I can see my self in them.
it means they don't want to hurt your feelings because you obviously care more than they do
but i do believe in love at first sight.it happens rarely .
He wouldn't like it if you looked at other men, so tell him that and work it out.
If they ask, I would recommend saying, Oh, you!
If you have crushes on guys and can't imagine ever being w/ a girl= gay.

It is a hard thing to do but if you love the person then  it is so worth it.
tell your new girls about her b4 any thing goes beyond a first date.
so jsut take this advice, at least one of you should use a condom.
you said your shy use it to your advantage.
Would he get mad a you?
Do this out in a nice public resutrant don't ever become desprate.
what a jerko, buy him socks and underware, the cheap ones too
If your not ready dont  do it even if that means breaking up with him.

I'm kinda a shy guy too, and noisey rooms don't help when you're trying to socialise.
but if you really want to be happy ignorance is bliss
if you're worried about hurting their feelings by not saying it, then you care, so tell them that.
If you like her then yes.
Ask him to do something sometime, if he like's you he'll say yes.
It depends on both of you!
this will not always work, but you have to take the good with the bad.

Because they figured out how easy we are...
I don't so much just making eye contact or simply flirting..
nope what if she finds out your cheating
Guys try to emulate their dads.
cause a real man doesn't need sex, he needs a friend.
they just never will until they loose you.
you can always try again once you desided hes done w/ his games.
tell her you have a girlfriend already
There is nothing we do for fun.
I guess you got your answer ;)
I did not choose to not be gay, I am just not and I would not want to be.

A fat wallet asnd a large ****.....good luck
I can give it up by sharing it with him/her
If it's that bad then get out.

Just find someone right for you.
then he'll play until he goes to bed.

See if he likes it or not.
The person that is always there for you no matter what.
the diff, men don't have the stigma of being labled a sl*t hanging over thier head.

Making any ones life a hell on earth is just not worth the energy.
find out something you and him both like to do and ask him if he wants to ex.
this may seem stupid but it worked for me.
It is not just a guy thing.
(i'm assuming they were just touching themselves...) how old are them?
id say its because the guy would receive twice the loving.

but keep in mind your robbing him of the bacholer party.
If he just wants to be friends keep the relationship on a friends level.
then just build off whatever she says.
Good guys are out there, it's just so terribly difficult staying that way for very long.
depends are there childern envolved is ex still going to be around?
Why not try to spice it up with him.
Also by Spars read A Walk to Remember and watch the movie...Both are really good!
if i were u i would move out.
so you are an ahole for not making her feel loved.
how about with the city of troy?

well of cource it's ok if you love them.
I want a good girl, you want a good guy.
So if you give cash give $75 or $100.
you need to bang her, screw him, itll be worth it...
Just have to be patient and show, not say, that it's ok !!
I love him a lot yet question if I am in love with him.

RIGHT HE NEEDS A FRIEND NOT A LOVER.
well get her something you know she will like.
you should tell him you know what's going on and that he needs to come clean.
it means he doesnt like you
if he likes you he'll work with your circumstances...
get over it and move on, no one is worth the pain you're putting yourself through.
you'll find it was worth the wait.
i bet there is not any gift better than love

guy cheats on girl to get what other girl has.
Tell her to take a hike.
you dump him and he comes backthen keep him.
If that doesn't work, cut her loose...she has feelings for that dude.

yes some men don't masturbate they just don't like to or want to.
You need to find new friends buddy...
after you give brith to a child you love it.

Girl i'm in the same boat.
i want u ;) my mail is hussienothman@hotmail.com add me
then she went crazy one day and said she just wanted a break but just wanted to be friends.
Not unless you really start having a intrest in the guy/girl!
Show her your real self and never lie.
There is no time to waste with people who do not care about you.
ok : get satisfaction on your own) and then try to think about her.
if it is the truth, then reveal it !
let him go and do both of you a favor.
uuum whisper in his ear...it depends on who the guy is.
you know they say you got have friends before lovers maye it a good thing
ask him to use his credit cards..
more you look ; less mistakes you make .
If not, DO NOT CHANGE YOURSELF FOR HER!
If she likes you it is just fine
like you would approach a friend you already know.
They are probably thinking of pornstars anyway!
When he said just kidding he really meant don't get mad
go up to her and be all do you like me, cuz i like you?
love is just a funny thing sometimes.
i do this 2 my man all the time, but we can do anything yet.
Your funny and good looking, right?
can you please clarify - why is it harder?
If she says its just not then let it end at that.
you just have to find them.
just keep looking till something clicks.
WELL I SAY JUST IGNORE THEM AND DO WHAT YOU WANT.
If she really cared to come back, she wouldn't have done all that crap.
.. you'll find out after .. happy hunting :)
baby,write this message again,but by fhone,kisses.. +90 536 463 83 47
i dont know i m virgin.
I don't want someone that may kill over the next day.
beware of the prison hook ups.
At least not with any girls that I respect.
If he still makes up excuses.
Dont delay - because there may be others waiting!
Because they're Selffish ,ignorant,or just need to get some relief........  Then agian is just my opinion   P.S.
i'm a woman so trust me when i say soft, gentle sex is better.
ask your mind then your heart
when caring about someone and loving them the sam ewhy you love your parents but a little dirty
if someone askes you to dance, go, even if you don't want to dance with that person.
there and many fish in the ocen
Does he want me back or does he just hate me that much?
:-)Don't sweat it too much if you mess up just tell her how I got engaged.
may b they do but there scared 2 talk 2 u just b urself
and what kind of 'best friend' would use you like that?
oh, and myspace.com is a free one
you cant love somebody you dont know.
Is there anything I can tell her to try to fix her brainwashed head??????
Don't get married again wait like 5 years.
If things go well, (you will know).
He can get in really bad trouble.
actually, 3 hours would not even be enough for me.
LL and his lips.....now that's a man!
Ask her to see your husbands baby pictures and learn about the family.
neither of the above two but only thickness of the boy's wallet!!!
you can't make him, HE has to want to.
Send a pic... show urself up... talk to him
if you just love him because you want an older man, yes.
you have to really  work past it if you love the  person.
well if your on tv or movies i will love you forever
Men who cheat do not love their wives.
Then, you'll look back when you're old and say wht the Hell was I worried about???
Sounds like to me you got a little situation here.
if u dont mind..n u love him.. y not?#@ but this wont last long for sure.. =p
he never did it again, but it was kind of in the back of my mind.
If you want a dumbed-down version...
2 parents are better than 1, no matter what anybody says.
Don't beat yourself up over it if its not meant to be.
Get out go date, enjoy ya life have fun!
Buy a strap on, not as good but hey.
No  Cheating is cheating much like rape is rape.
i'm lookin for the answer myself
kenny g.  actually i never have tried it with him but i bet it would be good to try.
Just wait and see - not bother much.
I like this girl from church.
what the hell should i do now?
If you have to ask then chances are it is probably just a game.
well, you can be nice to her to start with.

Actually, ask him what he likes and go from there!
He goes out with his guy friends and she's not allowed to go out with her girl friends.
you think what is she doin?
She will probably be staring at you speechless and then she'll say Yes, yes, yes or something similar.
i told him i had a secret that he couldnt tell anybody.
and that is just stupid to say if you don't LET him cheat he will leave.
im sry but age will always be an isue.
Ask him if he had any trouble finding your place, how his dinner was, that sort of thing.
If you cant stop thinking bout he/she.If ur intimidated by him/her.
That sounds pretty screwed up right there.
he cant possibley care that much if he is indeed cheating.
lets keep a secret as secret.
i mean obviously you arnt worried about the wifes feelings because your baggin her hubby... so why tell?
GIRLS want rough guys with lots of testosterone.
anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes

Us guys always wonder what is wrong with some of you women.
She is married & has a child!
So why do you guys think this happens?
or the age difference, although that isn't really that much.
i dont know, wwell find it some kind of way.
i need like revenge or something any ideas?
But some have messed up teeth.
like the song says,  age ain't nuthin' but a number, baby!
Hmm, how about Are you a virgin?
My hubby is rude to me too.
When i say dork i don't mean it in a mean way i call everone dork .But it reality.
And oh, by the way, will you marry me?
Im only 18 but come on, most 50 y/o's will never have a chance with a 24 yr. old!
If it were just us guys I wouldn't even think of mentioning it.
If you don't love, you don't have friends.
It depends if u met the guy in real life, because love also takes actions
be yourself, if your funny then make a girl smile.
nope, there is nothing you can tell her, she has to experience it for herself....
talk to him first dont wait.
sorry to hear that that sucks big time but i agree with everyne in here
To me age is just a number!
And he just doesn't want me anymore and has a girlfriend now.
and why is everyone so hard on the guy because he knows what he wants?
go to church and pray...no joke it works..happened to me
Get over it and move on
The only way I see it lasting, is if you can get his momma to love u.
next time you see him , go up and talk about life.
thats a hard one but try to do something special for him for christmas
the worst she could say is no...
of course,  though, it depends on what kind of girl it is.
To find out, go to chat.yahoo.com
Get over it...That is unless you are obsessed with them...then seek Mental Help, i.e.
Well don't do it cause that is cheating and that would be just wrong.
If you ever intend to have a girlfriend you will have to ask some girl out.
Don't ask her in front of an audience or use pick up lines, or BS.
Keep your mouth shut and if you love him, never never never do anything like that again.
And u have someone by ur side all the time
is there a baby already pending?
Money and Intelligence with one you could get the other
Two months is nothing.. dont stall it, just break up with the guy!
im scared of games, my wife was my best friend
Don't put your life on hold.
If you need to ask this question then probably this is not the right one.
I WENT TO MY GYN AND EVERYTHING CAME OUT OK.
yes you should love that person
anything except making him fuck you.
maybe he might just want to be friends.
One other thing that popped into my head.
In Heaven, so keep praying so you can get there and meet them!
THEY want what your lady friend has: YOU.
Nothing, its not your place to tell him.
and come up with positive answers instead.
average guy- sex   nice guy- a caring woman to love and be with for the rest of his  life.
no you idiot a education is better than a boy!!!!!!!
a girl friend is a girlfriend!
Be nice to her and looks always seem to do the trick too.
If you are confortable and your mate is, than who cares?
does he have a fave sports team?
go out and meet new people.
why don't you try someone who love you too?
If he spends his weekends with you.
you need to learn to love yourself befor any one else ever does
Because they think with the wrong head.............
no, men are always capable, nothing a little viagra cant help
why don't you try someone who love you too?
you need to learn to love yourself befor any one else ever does
Because they think with the wrong head.............
no, men are always capable, nothing a little viagra cant help
Because girls think with their brain and guys think with the tool between their legs.
Now that is just common sense...
omg i would sooo go with chris brown cuz he is sooo hott!
But i just cant help it.
mabey there are not mean people just people with different thoughts and perspectives that you do not agree with.
mone on and find some one new.
tell him hes sexy and tell him how u feel about him.
I'm a total sucker for women with an accent...
please anser because i need to know
hit me back and let me know
it probably runs in their family
they been friends for years and she says she dosent want him in that way.
Note: Don't go for the cheap ones, they're unrelieable...
well i would be with my wife instead of another person but thats just me.
when he gets home it's the first thing he does.
Im certain that the other person feels the same way but !
Well....there are other things that could mess it up, too:  Pregnancy would mess it up.
Then you say, Honey, did you see the ice?
In my opinion I gave up on dating bi women a long time ago...too dramatic!
1/ doing so, she may find you interesting (don't ask why).
And he shoes you a good time, and buy you things that being just a friend won't do.
Once a cheater, always a cheater.
It just means that he does want a girlfriend right now  Don't overanalyse.
Now I remember why I hate you!'
well if you love him and want to help him as you help him keep your feelings in check.
I would treat him better than his girl and sex him till he wants it every day
And then you're back with them for about 10 minutes and you go 'Oh yeah!
You could probably find someone on myspace or tagworld
If they don't know now the will when things start burning, and I don't mean intuition!
they will ask you out and then when you turn them down they get all upset.
Even getting a phone call is no assuance they are real.
I NOW THAT SOME POEPLE THINK I'M WRONG BUT I TELL IT LIKE IT IS.
well how old are you and if he doesnt notice girls he migth be gay
all the answers u get may be just an advice.
mabey you need some time apart.
Especially when we start talking all cutesy?
when u say no that means no!
or better try impressing her friend
it all depends on how much of the color you plan to wear , e.g.
i mean he plays between 20-30 hours a week.
Cause I got it, but you can't have any!
and also ask why u did not feel love towards her b4.
Well first off, MOST of the richest men only care about their money.
BROTHER I'M JUST BEING FOR REAL!
tell her directly ... cuz breaking up never wait a while
got to find out this kinda stuff before you get married forever
To rub her nose in it?
To keep it short, move on and DO NOT come back to him.
If you were told that by a woman : it probably means no.
This makes me go gaga over chicks.
He's my man thats all I need.
I go to school with him and I am kinda avoiding him but I want to tell him.
um, heh, red light district, bring condoms
doesnt matter the age difference as long as you get along and love eachother
Or easier perhaps, if u can actually see the person (e.g.
keep that as a want or a fantasy.
But, is it really true love?
You people on here are so incredibly illiterate!!
WE ARE GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE SAME S!
My sister married a mommas' boy and they've been married for over 35 years!
TRUST ME IF YOU ARE WHATS UP THE CHICKENS WILL COME
The best thing about such a person is she/he is in contact with u  always!!!!!!
flirt with him so he gets the idea
I think you'd have to have a foot fetish to understand (not that I do.. just saying...)
Find another man to get involved with (dating,hanging out or just socializing) this usually drives men nuts!!
If you just want a girlfriend or sex, move on.
i think 16 is a good age to start
it depends how he physically feels in his mind
Does he really even make you happy?
So yes, I believe they can last!
ALSO TRY NOT TO BE FAT
a CD...come on you can scrape up tax, right?
some girls marry/ love boys 10 years older then themeselves.
Approximently what am I looking at here in price
If you want freedom why did you get married.

S&M is only to be attemted with someone you really trust!!!!!
chad michael murray, johnny depp, freddy prince jr., travis barker, and many many more
is it good to try to be there for him and be so madly in love with him too?
I think she will go out with you...
respect her too, this rule applies not only to girls but to boys too... to everyone.
I really don't care what other people think.
last address is in quezon city, metro manila and her maiden name is imelda aldea
average looking well figured lady  are the best
if U r looking a relationship with a stranger means, that u r fedup with ur life partener.
you look nice...and see where the conversation leads.
if he digs you then there should be no problem.
5: are you looking for a boyfriend?
you don't need a boy to make you happy.
I HAVE READ SO MANY WHAT SHOULD I DO?
Toby McGuire, Bill Murray, or George Clooney  Yes, I said Bill Murray
wow ... how old are u well mmm try hard to get him back and ur love
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE GIRL OR THE GUY.
Do I give him a li'l hug?
45 seconds may be just fine for one couple and another may need hours...
Hey your husband and i both can't see you.
Yes if your son is 21
id someone looks like a slob, they are a slob.
hi i personly go for the guys that flirt and arent shy!
Do you have to ask at the front desk or is it by like the deodorants and shaving stuff??

it's called trust if you don't have it you don't have her.
because they are full of shit.... he has a bad soul.
(very important to make her curious!)
i guess, both situations are mutually exclusive!
If so then tell him that fair is fair.
it means that he's not ready to get in a relationship right now.
i like my women a little on the trashy side..but clean...lol
man id say, wait at home and so youd have nothing to loose..
this is the type of thing i would tell my younger sister.
If she doesn't even like u, well then u're history.

I dont know are you ever rude to him?
and then take a public speaking course.
It is best way to trap the girls and so you are a GURU.... lol
but not how they die or at who's hands(if any).
don't call him, don't see him, and don't let him do the same to you.
she wanted me,i made the move,she refused me and made me look like a fool,
u might just like both thats ok
stay busy,and most important love yourself first!!
How about dinner and a movie?
And I've got better than that.
Just say Well, this has been fun, but I have to get going.
Well first of all...be yourself, everyone else is taken...so you need to figure out what suits your style...
Of course they should be married first.
That's it you have got your mail back.
He wants you to pick the girl that he's going to have sex with to get revenge on you?
If no then you didnt need him no way.
and i agree with the other guy pics help
Call to say she misses you?
masterb*tion..it is sex with someone i love.
HELLO AGAIN, PLEASE WEAR LESS CLOTHING.
she is STUPIED like other girls ....
You know the saying...If something is too good to be true, it probably IS.
Getting an STD, AIDS, or pregnant isn't worth the risk.
they are the same age but they don't get, well you know that close!

:) (If you can get her address.)
ofcourse yahoo is gr8 try it  it is cheap and goooooooooooood
Other guys wouldn't lie about a thing like that.
you have standards and you should wait until you find someone you love.
Now I feel she is seeing someone else @ work and it's driving me crazy.
Try new things, switch it up!
when you already have answer to that question..then make your move.
i can't find any girls to go out with at my school, what should i do?
this one will get you MAJOR points with her!!!!
Just don't give it away though.
dont lead him on, that will hurt him worse.
I love him... Am I crazy??
ask him to help u undress.hint:wear a lot of clothes.
because you told me yesterday that you were married and you hadn't had sex in ten years.
in fact some of the best sex i ever had was with an average guy.
no, if you dont want him frenchin you its your decision
Chatted with you on Yahoo IM...
If not then maybe at the mall (I don't really know about that though.)
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE MALE GENDER
I am hoping it is not because of the friends I hang out with.
*T BUT MY ANSWER IS THIS YOU LEFT HIM FOR A REASON.
But if he is cheating, then I wouldn't put up with it, once a cheater always a cheater!
usually 18 year old guys looking to go out with younger girls just want sex.
take ur bf to a cheap motel.
AND THEY TAKE RESPONSIBLITY FOR ALL THERE ACTION  THAN THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH
i wanna have boyfriend so bad!
your madre (you cant come back from that)
mabey he thinks you want nothing to do w/ him.
You just gotta figure out what it is you don't want them to have that they want.
Looks,personality,honesty,and confidience and not exactly in that order.Same things guys look for in a girl :)
If it is a guy like you, more power to ya.
Or am I faking that I know anything about faking.
get a new boyfriend and have so much fun with him you forget about your ex
Don't worry about things like that.
reality, it takes a lot of work though to get one, lol
what do i do to find somebody?
so bad that he was saying some pretty mean and hateful things.
Don't ask why- it just happens that way.
I have been with this guy since May...
the only thing that would make a guy worthy of your love, is if you are worthy of his...
Get another girl to hang all over you in front of her.
try the Highschool lol well you asked
Nothing We just want to know things!!
Some girls are sensitive to a guy telling her he is in love with her.
Just don't let him bully you around.
when you get married you should cling to your wife and noone else.
Don't let her off the hook easy.
Keep her gifting her as and whenever u feel.
so your postin a message so obviously you think you gotta chance!
Date her if you want to.
Which means she only had one guy and none for years already.
I am 21 and I am the most mature person I even know.
IF u r in an affair u will know it!!!!!!!!
a qustion for u, are u a homosexual?
Hi, 4 yrs back i saw a girl n fell in love with her.
I guess, if u keep chasing the feeling u'd get hooked.
if your a boy you like boys a lot?
ignore her... she's not going to pay your bills if you lose your job.
So I need to know and find out some new fun places to hang out.
At last both of them will finger at you.
If you like her go and just be natural.
Sorry =[   Anyway, I don't know what to say about your dilemma.
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS JUST LIKE YOU.
He  could have one and not know it!
AS A FORMER CHEATER I DID IT FOR THE SEXUAL PLEASURE ONLY!
she will in return... be optimistic!
you should start watching out for her.
Now I am a guy and i am talking about faking it.
Also, guys are not nearly as adept to picking up on hints as some girls would think.
I like ppl who love GOD...
Then got lonely and hated it.
First kiss... Somewhere special that you'll both remember.
i met my bf online, he lived about 5 hours away from me.
Meet him and see if you get disappointed
it's not such complicated that other contries think
If you can't tell...then you're not 'cause when you are, you'll know...and you won't be asking that question...
But you can lay in bed and think about her.
There's things that guys fantasize about, and then there's reality.
just talk about other guys like he talks about girls.
trust me honey, you have plenty of time for all of that stuff.
hey just dump him and have no regrets...unless u wanna do drugs!.....lets lead some decent moral life guys!
u should just brake ur friendship up wit her and forget her and move on with ur life
If he looks like he's gonna puke, just turn it around and say that it's another friend date.
well i know one thing there is always a way thew hard times and troubles.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO DATE SOMEONE WHO WOULD CHEAT ON YOU?!!!
do i make a secret public?
i live in santa monica, california.
if you are talking about guys, you havent found the right one.
i mean thats virtually up to you to decifer and your parents.
TRY GOING TO THE LOCAL CHURCH
Love your ex, but only make Love to your current boyfriend / baby daddy.
It would be nice to see just what it is that is so attracting to these girls.
no i don't think we ever forget our first love i know i haven't.
punch some dude in the face
because they don't want a realtionship with you.
i thoght about the same thing, but i dont think sprint pcs can do that.
I feel normal and it's OK that I'm gay.
no i hate them i wish theyed all die!!!!
Don't ever regret anything you do.
dont do that, if he cared for you he woulndt want you gettin in trouble
so wat is the deal with that...... guys tell me wat u think.
she also thinks she is bieng cute.
It's just like Myralys said, you just know.
BUT ONCE BACK TOGETHER THE LIES AND PORN WILL START BACK.
Always be busy even when I am not.
If he slept with someone else - don't give him a chance.
not excatly but always be cautious
He'd say it was just entertainment for him..yea right.
dont waste your short life like a ping pong game.
If you really want out.. get out.
Is it really other men you want?
a nice loving guy that loves you for who you are
you are only a kid once in your life.
YOU SHOULD KISS YOUR GUY WHEN YOU THINK IS THE RIGHT TIME.
And that is the way they feel about you too.

ask him out first, of course
or he may not know what to say to you if you go out again.
.......which do you think is worst?
Plus, the first nut is gonna be the fastest.
the sex will be mind blowing.
Much as if a person lies once they will probably lie again.
Either that, or wait for some girl to ask you out.
Tell her exactly what you posted up there.
Or do I sound to pathetic?
because some times it just feels good to let out emotions
jump off a bridge in front of her just kidding
Once in friend land, you aint getting out.
I am happy being me and you should be happy too.
It must have been pretty bad.
If he calls you just to say hi and buys you  surprises.
Especially the nice ones who aren't picky about features?!?
but if you must go get really drunk and run to vegas before her buzz wears off!
if she isnt willing back off!
well it depends on what kind of women you want man
Tell her what you feel, give her a shock......check out!

it is more noticeable on your left hand than you right
yeah, me...big legs, and big thighs....hehe
At 7/11 you don't have to ask.
WITH A NAME LIKE MR. BIG DICK PRICE SHOULD NOT MATTER
2: how many relationships have you been in?
Hope this helps in some way or other.
He says he is not cheap.
do not cheat, never ruin a good thing.
BE POLITE AND DONT BE VULGAR MOST WOMEN DONT LIKE THAT.
I want to wear something nice so that I look great but not sexy.
well honestly speaking i do not think its love at your age, its just infatuation and curiosity.
HE'S MAD THAT HE CAN'T FIT HIS HUGE THING IN THAT LADY HE LIKES.
If she is the blunt type then you should ask her and not beat around the bush
Take her out on this New year's eve, go anywhere and have fun (go to restaurant, cafe, park...).
I was young when we got 2gether & now I want to have fun & experience other men.
It's just going to make both of your lives miserable.
Run like Hell is after you, young'n.
On the other hand what right has any married man have with a mistress?
depends on what you mean by online relationship.
hehe, okay, kidding, but I don't know, both colors are very spring-y...

please e-mail me back about who your friends name is,and when did I date her!!!
Overt revenge is stupid, and puts you in jeopardy.
nobody is too good to be true.
try and join him in playing.
belive in ur mind then follow ur heart
I feel really bad because his looks are really bothering me.
If that doesn't convince him, he's not worth it anyway.
bad or good....your stuck with it!
- *You Can't Describe A...Love Moment?[Sad.]:(.
just a guess on that last part.
there are tons of wierdos out there who like it and use it to get themselves turned on.
Oh honey -- you better believe there are plenty of good people out there.
Good luck it can be done!
I gotta tell ya, you sound like a fun date!

Then ask...once you ask don't back down or say nevermind or anything like that be consistant.
Just as I said ....my ex.
you don't have to say, i love you if you don't mean it.
MAYBE IF YOU CALL ME,I WOULD THINK YOU DO AND ILL BE SO HAPPY.
don't go overboard trying to be her friend.
im a girl but i think its true...what about priest...i dont think they would
no way..how bout u meet him after skool....
get a new guy, or if not try to wear highheels around him
only if you let it go past flirting
That doesn't make it right though.
It's just chemicals in your brain, baby!
If you want a GIRL, don't EVER be her friend.
it's ok, u can make a great couple either romantic or just friends;  it's feelings what count
Enjoy being a kid while you can!
you must be not so pretty
On the posative side I learned alot.
if you act like a cocky little moron, we'll know that too.
give him a time for the stuffs he is doing.
also is it right 4 me 2 have sex ?
i don't think i'm unappealing but how am i suppose to get some love from him?
We talk everynight... and I cant even deny it.
If yes, means she is OK for been as she is now.
So I have no idea what to buy him.

No it's not wrong to love!
I wouldn't cheat on my wife if you placed a gun to my head.
you just have to let time go by.
Just ask her once why and if she doesnt say then leave it alone.
this only prooves that you do not truly love your boyfriend.
and theres to many diferent kinds of reigions.
Don't dwell on it and it won't be an issue.
Face it you don't have a marriage.

but as for the guy wait.
I'm going to lay it down like I see it though.
It sounds like both of you need to grow up a bit before either one of you gets married.
ask him why hes been acting so shady and chances are he doesnt even know he is.
yes i would  because this might stop his behavior
BECAUSE THERES NO MORE GOOD MEN THEY ALL DIED WITH MY GRANDFATHER.
not sure what u mean by Will I get him ???

otherwise you should find a foreign BF!
ITs like all mental.... if you dont hit it off in the head first the rest is all sex.

Do whatever he wants in bed.
but hey, whatever floats ur boat.
Or good people dont exist anymore

i am also going kinda of scared too.
but what that makes them different is their taktics!!!!
don't be stupid and enjoy the moment.

its obvious that he just wanted your body.
But most of the time, I don't at all.
not all guys want one thing some are true sweet hearts
I just want to be friends & nothing more.
So basically if that is what floats your boat than ride it Girl!!
Basicly, one way to tell is if you're flirting with this guy and don't realize it.
Some women do, and some men enjoy it also.

i like this girl but she is popular and im not as popular as she is.
find what u like shemales bi-sexual whatever u feel good with.
i bet she is hot, too, like u!
I use to think all men were jerks but it was just the local I was in.
so always try to look at things from every angle.
Tell your ex_bf to get lost.
AGE IS NOTHING BUT A NUMBER.
no way, what if u get cought?
if that person truly cares about you they will back off and give you time.
I know a girl who got promised with a rifle instead of a promise ring, and she loved it!
He's just not that in to you.
Too many bad boys out there.
:) I am single and attractive but a tad bit sht at first.
to me it would be my wife !
Before I got married I had one year in college as a computer graphic artist.
I must side with GETRD2GO above... married women with boyfriend?
Dont plan any thing just be punctual on the wedding day,,best of luck,,
Dont let other people tell you who to hang out with and who not to.
This is not having sex but your b.f. might like it enough to stay...
AND HOW CAN ONE GET ONE?
cause they want their girl/boyfriend to get near to their siblings
Once I realized this, my next relationship really worked because I didn't need it, I wanted it.
But if he has changed, or is willing to change, then try getting counsling or something like that.
IF ALL ELSE FAILS - USE YOUR HANDS!!!
LL Cool J definately.... Gotta love those lips lol
well to this day she is still talking about me!
because you love or care too much...
No becuase once you get married you dan't have sex anymore.
do what feels right to you.
sure.at least shes experienced.but itll ruin your friendship prolly.
i need ideas on the best way to propose to her.
Well...Being a lesbian, I'm often around gay guys a lot...and trust me honey...Not all of them are good looking!
tell her that its gay and annoying.
Older women like nice men, and younger women like jerks.
So, keep it new and interesting!!
and if your considering cheat just double check you care as much as you feel you do
then maybe you'll get some action!
do you have gay chat rooms for teenagers
And don't lead her on afterwards.
SHES GOING TO FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF SH!T.
I told   her every thing clearly and she said she will think.
because most people make the mistake of just blurting it out.
When will men stop being such..........
So have fun looking for the right woman.
its the god spot, its whats missing in lots of peoples lives
He has more issues than you know and you can't fix him, don't even try.
and i wanted to see who else is in love
Boyfriends and girlfriends do things that other friends usually don't do, so they form special bonds.
WELL I GUESS BECAUSE GOD MADE YOU THAT WAY.
Don't always smell like a guy.
when you see him in person....give him some love if you know what i mean:)
don't break up with him BUT DONT CALL HIM!!!!
females chimpanzees do not have orgasm.
= I'd like to have sex with you.
i had a baby 6months ago.
for the simple reason that we, men, love you ladies.
you never said that you had everything and he had nothing.
there is no real good answer for this ??
its not like he is going anywhere.
I watch adult movies with my hubby.
Men are kind of like dogs.
if he is serious after three months.
Always Back off if you hear these unfortunate words.
and he came and talked to me in both of my dreams.
we do and we dont have feelings fro them ....most of our friends are guys
I am a guy and I can honestly say, that porn is disgusting.
i think this is true...well for me it is and i think alot of women do.
If you love them then talk about it and ask but don't expect to much.
take your time and whatever you do, do not do the porno tongue flick.
I mean, he is basically saying Gosh it is tough being me.
Maybe ur bf found a really insecure girl in hopes for a jell-o pitted cat fight!
You're certainly attentive tonight = Is sex all you ever think about?
Once her and I broke it off - I knew alot of other bi-sexual and gay women.
I HAD MY HEART BROKEN ONCE AND I SUFFERED ALOT.
run away screaming and waving your hands!
And believe me no guy wants someone that is really loose.
go up to him and say im sorry i thought boys were sopose to called girls.
I read a lot and am not what you would call attractive at all.
but are you sexually attracted to women more than men.
the ones that do that, are totally not ok as human beings
no just learn from your mistake,but don't hurt your girlfriend
a good spa days always nice.
A place where wanna be gangsta's and rappers hang out
do you think she would leave her husband?
just close your eyes and give it a go...   :-)
Send him this text message:  hun,  my phone died, but my luv 4 u never will.
a necklace with a heart charm on it.
if not be careful and be yourself next time you go hunting for a wife.
just let them hang out support your friend dont let it get to you.
let your best friend yvan tell him
even give them a little timer to watch.
tell her what she wants to hear.
but there guys and their usually hot.
Who Ever Said Yes is Very WRONG  That is a no no
yes....hell i have fallen in love every other night with a ton of female movie stars...lol
Her sentences are starting to sound like, I ahhness got ahhness an A+ ahhness on my ahhness math test.
she will understand then if she is she will open up to u.  no worries
they will follow around your wife and find out if she is cheating on you or not!
yes, if they really have a true love.
Didn't I just tell you I took em all and turned em into lesbians?
yes,but it will hurt you ,so pick one!
once i found out for sure i told him and he proposed.
If you guys had so much fun, I doubt he just lost interest, especially since he is still calling.
wouldn't you say that you are attracted to him, like him...?
Keep it on a don't ask don't tell policy.
The best thing would be to ask, What's wrong?
I think you might just love what your not getting.
christmas is not about gift giving.
If that doesn't work then he is not as mature as you think... Hope that helps.
He don't even look at me like he wants me but he wants to marry me, why?
ive heard that the first time(im talking about sex) is the worst time.
Just ask her wull you go to the movie theater withe me tonight~~~ it is easy to do~
my daughter still talks about how he treated me.
mean but if she is cheating on you she diserves it!
need to decide who's more important, ur boyfriend or ur friend/roommate..
Men either do or they don't.
or is she not telling u because that something could harm u.
one day, I'm gonna leave you and guess what.
but if they don't mind y should u.
i think its ugly and disgusting.
He's sketchy... She didn't catch it until recently... that means that he's been playing without rubber.
everyone has different ways of doing things.
the best way a man asked me out was just so innocent, he asked.
Gay guys are more into things girls like (shopping, decorating, accessorizing,etc).
well you can always learn more about them then do things they like.
ask him to hang out with you and be really nice to him maybe give him a gift
Please dont beat... normally that makes things worse.
caue u spend too much time with strangers on yahoo then meetin people in real life
I have lots of great friends .
he knows hes not the father.
A woman's most erogenous zone is her BRAIN!!
Only she knows whats going on....so you HAVE to talk to her.
Because they r afraid of their own sexuality.
and they really do make her look fat, don't say that.
smarts matter because laughter can only get you so far.
just.... don't kill her, that would be a bad idea.
but find out the age thing first/
a lady in the streets and a freck in the bed!!
Are you interested in this girl??
Meaning whats good to do on a date
Not bad to love him, bad to wreck his home though.
Dude...whatever you do don't give her a peom.
you should care but if she really loves you she wouldn't let you go
i couldn't imagine not being married, but like i said, everyones different...
Good luch with the great danes!
I like doing things guys like to do like skateboarding and we even are a band (i play drums).
I don't know, but if you find out let me know!
I keep going back and forth.
I wouldn't give it to her.
Why on earth would any woman want that?!
No matter how you say it, it's going to hurt like hell.
as many times as you want.
I want to call my mom and tell her I just met the girl of my dreams.
Means you need to follow your dreams!
But right now.......you just aren't in a position to be that person.
your not only fooling them but most importantly your fooling yourself.
depends what your lubing..KY for sex or wd40 for other lubes
will ill let u go deeper
Also girls do have alot more hormones than guys.
but She just broked up with me last year, and I don't know why.
Ask her out and see what she says.
How do i deal with this?
BTW I am not saying Arts students are not decent.
I was 19 <Male> before i lost my viginty to my wife!!!
what you need to ask yourself is can i deal with this for my life.
yeah it depends on the guy and the girl.
Do not comeout and say I want a divorce, that word is hostile.
If either boy didn't work out I always had the other one.
so u just need to wait onother one the same dream :D
there is this other guy that loves me and is going to ask me out.
we only heard of guys want to marry more then 1 gal.
pay her and go home to your wife
does he drool when he stares?
Like a dinner at her fav.
Sexy goes both ways, so try acting like you are and you will be sexy.
maybe he wants u to ask him out.
it would be alright for barbie!!!
Then USE THAT ANSWER TO BASE YOUR NEXT BIT OF CHAT ON.
ask her or catch her in the crime
It was a very funny dream.
maybe he wants u to ask him out.
it would be alright for barbie!!!
ask her or catch her in the crime
It was a very funny dream.
I could have went the rest of my life without ever seeing her again.
get him a box of condoms and say lets do it sexy i think that will work
hope this works and can u tell me after words if it does or doesn't  ~shivani~
i was asked out by this guy yesterday and i said yes.
= I'd like to have sex with you.
how do i break up with the other guy without hurting his feelings??
yes i houp you vill hapy new year
take him to small claims court
Just try i mean if it's big then ?
I hope your wife reads it online!
If she will not sign it tell her to hit the ROAD.
I would just break up with her..thats messed up
but doesnt no that im going out with the other guy.
PLEASE - only swingers respond to this question!!
It's pretty hard to find the total package, don't care if your a guy or girl.
You just gotta let things go once in a while.
BTW, begging for ladies on the internet makes you look oh so slightly pathetic....
no way if you just met this guy you should not let him move in with you.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE IN A CASUAL RELATIONSHIP NOW.
Pretty people can be very ugly!
Try watching it with him, you might enjoy it too.
...and do women take this as a source of breast enlargement?
WE ENJOY SWINGING BUT WE ARE VERY STRONG AND DEDICATED IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.
and if thy shoot you down.
BTW, I've NEVER kissed a guy!!!!
Only Pigs actually enjoy havin sex 4 pleasure....
Just say nice things about him or her.
Sorry...I hope I'm wrong for your sake, but I don't think I am.
so think about that before you start digging.
see if your guy friends have friends that are single.
Get out there and do stuff that you like, and he will be there waiting for you.Good luck!
just wondering and support ur answers?
WHEN YOU FIGURE IT OUT ...SEND ME ONE
YOU DONT IT WILL CUM TO YOU. ]
Yeah, Go Ahead I mean I do It all the Time.
also be well mannered, be a gentlemen, chivalry is not dead yet!
I think dating older guys should not be a problem.
sometimes you get lucky and someone spills it.
Ask yourself if you love men.
you get to know him, you get to know everything.
i cant stand looking at my reflection.
YOU MEAN A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP.WELL,WHEN YOUR CASUAL RELATIONSHIP MATURES TO A FULL RELATIONSHIP,YOU WILL KNOW.
Women: do u or would u and why?
If she enjoyed/wanted it as much as u, then sure its gonna only help u.
ask him and do the first move
that's my two cents any way.
they are out there i promise!
How about, Hey, I need more sex !
well you have to turn them on first then it is all on from then on.
If anything's wrong you can always make it a kind of a joke.
look in his eyes, try to read his eyes or heart if u know him pretty well
If no then your first time shouldnt be bad.
Best Of Luck, Ice Princess P.S.
a straight female, openminded, a mother, sexually active, intelligent!
He wants u for sex and nothing else.
= I'd like to have sex with you.
Like: Hi _______ did you see _______ on TV last night?
if your askin this question then you need practice.
i look for a guy who is going to...
They want to see her full lips on or around their !
I just had things that he didn't and he had things that i didn't.
and he always leaves without telling her.
just don't expect to fall in love in 10 days unless you actually meet your perfect match
OR YOU CAN JUST ASK HIM TO BE UP FRONT WITHYOU!
there must b a reason for u guys to have broken up in the first place am i right?
if the like you back, or u think they like you, just go for it.
Do younger women see 38 yr old guys and think no way he's old!??
not long cause they will ask to se u soon so just get it over with
dont make a big deal about it.
Perhaps she likes you too much and is afraid that she is coming on too strong??
It'll be hard to leave, but GO NOW!
bcoz u dont have chance to love other guys girl friend.
So he would call me next and so on and so on.
I love him and I am going to marry him but I don't want my family to disown me.
yOU NEED TO STAY OFF THAT SHIT!!
be confident in your self, but not self absorbed.
Sounds like they're busy with their own lives/friends/whatever.
I dont know what to tell you.
Most of us are like this.
When your wife says What the......?!?!?!?!?
plus, if you are a bad conversationalist then you don't have to talk too much...
WY WIFE DID THE SAME THING.
(they will say it doesn't matter but it does!)
they have a list that may be helpful at weddingchannel.com
she wants romance, charm, wit, comedy, and you have to be good looking!!
she says i want to have sex with you.
and i know all of st8 people who have had them too.
But there is a saying - LOVE IS LOVELIER THE SECOND TIME AROUND, and its true.
CUT THE SECURITY BLANKET AND MOVE ON, YOU ARE ONLY COMMING BACK BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO DO SO.

well 2 tell them easy just tell them it is not working out and we should just be freinds.
leave him and find a good guy.
6 months you should be pounding her but good because in 12 mo.
I have a alot of guy friends!!!!!!
do u want 2 try to stop loving?
dont flip its not like he can just forget about her after all she is his ex
(Do not say anything like 'you seem like a nice guy, but...', this will just encourage him.
either way she's setting the pace.
some guys are different but i can only speak for myself.
remember that the cops won't be there 24/7 covering your backs.
By the way nosey family, welcome to outlaws I mean inlaws!
because if you get married he will not stop he will just hide it.
so like a horse cock transplant.
A NAUGHTY GIRL IN THE BEDROOM,IN THE KITCHEN,BATHROOM,STAIRES,    HALL,LIVING ROOM ,IN THE EVENING..    AY!
What if you ddo and he turns out not to be who you expect him to be?
Listen,can a leopard change it's spot no!
JUST GIVER TIME AND SHE WILL DO IT WHEN SHE IS COMFORTABLE.
Let me guess, this thing your tangled in, don't feel good does it?
maybe you should call and step up.
That's so you know what to scream.
what if you do do all the little things and she still dosen't come around?
yes i would because you dont like to share guys with another girl so yes i would be upset
i know he cheats on her bkoz him and my bf talk about it all the time around me.
you love someone and you wanna show it that you love him so much.
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
guys dont care, at least the ones that arent homos
Luckily, I am not that shallow!
Look him/her straight in the eye and say firmly, That is not nice.
I just find it extreemely unattractive.
but if you are old enough to make your own decisions and you truly love this person!
i have dated someone i worked with and it is too ackward.
You wont know until you ask
when in doubt ,whip it out :(
For some women, they think that its kinda gross, but if I was your girl...
because y'all are more put together and clean looking.
Show her what she's missing out on.
Sorry I gave you herpes is a good start.
if he got a girl... let it go...
but there are SOME good guys out there.
and thats what happened to myself.
yer co-worker.. one who's up to a date as much as you are.
well honestly i think u should be 15
Yeah but only the pictures of my boo..
If the father doesn't like u and your baby then don't marry to him, later on u will regret.
if u can answer these 3 questions then yoe if not try to strenghthen ur relationship w/ her
They don't they want a free ticket to the usa...
if they never call back that could probably mean that they are not interested much.
If he is playing you he will stay with her and keep leading you on.
if you don't belive me talk to a mind expert.
well u really don't know.u just feel that u r in love.
i met my wife that way.. wasn't entirely looking, but just made myself available and voila..
a vacation...somewhere nice and romantic....you'll be compensated :)
yep i'm in love and would be forever.
i dont have any mirrors in my bathroom or in my room or anything else.
If she likes movies, take her to a movie!
keep gay male friends, they can tell you things about you a woman won't.
She is everything I want, no more, no less.
a post nup is after your married.
Have your wedding at the local Shotgun Pete's (I hear it's like 20 dollars there).
Maybe if you ignore him once in a while, he might come around.
i dont think a women would date a gay man.
guys look at guys all the time, sizing each other up
GIVE HER AN BANANA AND ASK WHERE WHAT SHE THINKS OF WHEN SHE EAT'S IT
A best friend is like a Sister.
She'll be all over you like stink on pooh!
Also, you could ask him out -- It's okay to do that now!
even the virgins go down on guys
if you really can't trust him just tell him so he should understand it and except your decisson.

All we might say is Ya!, I showered and everything....not that cerebral.
WE don't always do our thinking with our brains.
she isn't a trophy, is she?
we've been married for 7years and i never bought him nothing..please help find the right gift ..thanks guys
Only if that's what SHE wants.
cuz we can only take so much, then there's nothing left to do but leave.
And I like kim chee and ka go ge.
dont worry though, destiny has a plan and will lead the right person to you at the right time!
love will make a way and dont let anything stand in the way of it!
I'ma go watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
Hi Sweety, Well not all women do but I guess most do.
and he should tell her she's sexi.
2. do you feel like y'all have known eachother 4ever?
If she's done stuff like that before,walk away and don't look back
But not all men act like Babies
he will tell you things he normally does not tell other girls.
we like eachother but we cannot go on.but we are intrested in our s.e.x
you 'll know in your heart, if it feels right.
i feel that from 1 year please answer to me what i do because i love him so mutch

yes i am in love with a loving, caring, and sometimes goofy man that always keeps me smiling!
It doesnt matter if the girl admits if she likes u or not.
enjoy being single and dont worry about whose right for you, there is probably more than one.
My list is sort of simple but it is the sort of thing that I like to talk about.
because yer all so good at it petal
i dont think he would ever be able to use it.
Never settle for anything, always believe that TOMMOROW IS ANOTHER DAY!
for a good relationship to work you need to b e honest
come on you can do better than that.
Warning: Do NOT try to fake an interest.
(As one of the other members said previously)  If she's not.
yes, you should wear it on your penis
OK so,  theres this guy that has a girlfriend.
You can't force her to do anything.
we both have careers, she is in her 20's and im in my 30's.
*  Dont try to look for him, he will come to you!!
Don't take this literally this is just my opinion........
Move on with your life and just be his friend don't push things to be more than that.
Your too big and it hurts, or the opposite.
if you got it going on looks-wise, she will be the one chasing you...that's how it works.
shes prolyl playin hard to get.
because people are dumb and in love
so you let him to do whatever he wants.
if some girl like that proposed to me i would have not even talked about it to anyone.
if youve been together that long chances are mom probably has a good idea.
there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Because gay guys are a lot like girls which is why they like guys no offense to gays.
AS I AM A GIRL BUT I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH MY BOYFRIEND FOR 3 YEARS NOW.
I guess I see it differently.
A pet, a kid, a relationship.
But hey..at least you fought, it would have been worse if you had run away or something like that.
heh...well, i can't seem to get along with girls that well.Most of my friends are guys.
If they don't listen to you - will they listen to their teachers???
my problem is i dont want to to come back and bit me in my ass.
Love... is being able to read stuff like this and then...finally...truly understand its meaning.
2 skinny is not attractive but 2 thick is not good for me either.
See here is the deal- when men want you- they let you know.
But, I guess it is not the best of the places for a third world citizen like I am.
You tell him/her that you love them, (maybe?)
It worked when a guy did it to me!!!
Men give love to get sex.
Y can't u have a fresh start for a new life?!
and your question is not silly?
There maybe lots of reasons why dad doesnt come home as often.
if yo don't get it move on to another one.
talk to him honey my boy friend and i  talk all the time
well you are stringing along three now why not keep it up.
If you have to ask if you're in love, the answer is no.
and even try to meet up with him but bring some friends.
hi i am 46 yrs old male 5'8tall
Thats the stupidest question I ever heard!
its only because of the thinking nothing else.
because your friend has a bigger brain then yours!!
Sounds to me like he's trying to control you a little too much!
If you don't, then don't bother.
but use to it by now
it turns them on, they're human beings...
cuz you never know if the guy is lying.
i can't believe gals can be thhis sceptical.
It could be two things man.
if you are a girl, it is natural.
That's funny, but I just delt with it.
it's hard, why fight it, they say the best way to fight temptation is to circumb to it.
He asks me who i was dating (no one).
NO STRINGS ATTACHED IS THE BEST POLICY BUT YOU ARE A BIG GIRL.
Maybe she's seen you ogling at women with beautiful bodies
Otherwise an you may have already known he has been with her while he was with you anyway.....................................
aslong as u get a number that means your doing good.
he don't have much time to see you and he not working.
I work where there are more guys than gals.
not really...maybe being really really really ridiculously wealthy as well?
always reasure her that she's beautiful.. do it constantly.. with or without her clothes on.
like at schol at games to watch on tv
and thanx for the answers u sent me.
Heck yeah we love it, especially if its the one we love doing the rubbing.
I'm 100% sure she'll love it :)
we will have been dating for at least 6 months on christmas day
Ive had this problem before and I am married.
Ah let's see...                    CAN   WOMEN ??
I think you mean 'obsessed', right?
a little bit of both won't hurt
but you should let your mother know!!!
I was with my lover !
by the way did i mention how close me and your boyfriend are!
us women r not mindreader like u guys are not.
but on average, most people have it once or twice a week.
he's your best friend, he would understand.
i read the only answer and i think its the best answer
If she likes art, take her to a museum or gallery....
nobody is anybody's until he or she is married.
lol  That's my advice.. :) Hope it helps!
porn is a relationship breaker not a helper!
Once a cheater, always a cheater.
You just haven't earned it yet, baby.
yes some women dont like it.
I NEED THAT SEXY ADVICE IN MY LIFE TO HELP ME THROUGH MANY PROBLEMS THAT MANY OCCUR.
Don't always dress like a guy.
THATS GOOD YOU HAVE A HIGH SELF ESTEEM.
you've got to show her you care.
I bet I found him at least five times.
well first of all...what are your chances?
There are so many great guys out there you don't need to put up with this type of behavior.
I pray that you get well                             C.Fluellen

DISAPLINE TAKE PRIVLAGES AWAY DONT LET THEM WALK ALL OVER YOU.
it feels soo great but sometimes it hurts a lot
He won't kiss me, even though it's been almost a year since we started dating.
with her fav flowers waiting... or fiendship ring wih something personal engraved in it.
The best you could come up with would be 'adulterer'

If you were my grlfriend I'd be worried!
and ur dad dosent like him so like you would have no future w/him n e way
its good if you appreciate it, bad if you like the earthly smelly look.
honorable but would have to wonder when the red flag would pop up.
anyway... what has done cannot be undo... so.. is better to don't play with fire...
so yea should i tell her or juss leave it in the pass?
I had either gotten too attatched or already slept with them or something and it has just been horible.
Some people just got it comin.
Do men really think about sex that much more than women?
But I would say tell her ASAP.
Tell her and get it off your chest.
Sounds like she might...  Why dont you try talking to her...
Frankly speaking do girls dont like it?
yeah espessilly if she is with her friends hanging out having fun.
no offense, it's just cultural differences here.
What if he left his wife and family for you?
when he asks you to marry him like you were saying, ask him where the rock is?
if not..and they arent goin to marry you.,then no
maybe you should just let him smoke weed.
I can't find my puppy, can you help me find him?
hot geek....but a nerd has no confidence therefore...no can do!
He's not only a creep, but he's stupid too...
He really loves his girlfriend so  I don't want to mess that up, but what am I to do?
If it's a, then forget it, she's psychotic once again.
a diamond ring will make a girl appreciate you after you made her mad.

UNLES YOUR KIDS & YOU HAVE NO WERE ELSE TO GO BUT THE STREETS,  MOVE ON.
Funny it used to be public but...
it's nice if they wear them on their butt and not on their head.
don't get in a rush about settling down.
thank god for us brave women.
carry her books, compliment her (shoes girls love shoe compiliments) and be sensitive.
cuz u annoyed them or just cuz they can't take it no more try comforting  them
YOU WILL RISK A FRIENDSHIP W HER, YOUR RELATIONSHIP W YOUR GUY AND YOUR FRIEND'S RELATIONSHIP.
:) Austin Texas should be a good place.
to be honest, it's somewhat depressing.. thanks, lady, i feel like poo now.
i am wierd in this i think but hey its my $.02
I do not see a problem with braces, they do not turn me off one bit.
depends on the girl, of course.
Men: does ur girl watch xxx movies w/ u, or do u wish she would & why?
They start at about 10 bucks.
a) flirting, proving to himself that hes still desirable.
Im a Gothy/punk girl so i personally would not be caught dead like that.
go on line go to chat rooms then met her in person.
he wants to raise the baby as his own.
you live with your parents and dont want them to get mad but you realy love this person!!
Ask her why she does what she is doing.
?please i need help bad on how to get over him or something please help!!
BUT, I know someone back in my country.
It's been misserable, but I stayed b/c I thought I had to.
tell your parents he's a friend.
If you wouldn't do it then she shouldn't do it.
then think for what it is?

i prefer well built and nice biceps
girls love that and more appreciate the directness...
I wear thongs and I was wondering if alot of guys like ladys wearing them?
if she flirt with you she likes you if she gets madd at u 4 anithing she does not
So your opening chat should be about people - YOU and YOURS, HER and HERS, THEM and THEIRS.

BECAUSE THATS WHAT YOU WOMEN ARE FOR :)
she found herself a sucker and soon he wont be able to meet her needs,even if 10 yrs.
next time u see him wear a really short skirt with no panties.
This leads me to the main problem I've seen with my sci-fi guy friends...they don't actually talk to women.
Hetfield said it don't feel good until it hurts Carpe' Diem
but if its someone that already loves you, i dont think that will matter to him.
Run, don't walk and don't look back...
with a lot of teaching from you over many years.
36-24-36 use to be concidered Perfect So yours isn't that far off.
being straight to the point may be tough but it gets the message out.
I dont have any enemy, so all are my friends
i need a girl who can give it to me if you kno what i mean
but I love both of them deeply
BUT A FREAK IN THE BED OH YEAH!
I like this guy, and he's my friend, and I really want him 2 ask me out...
Let the guy say it to you FIRST!
Leave it alone, don't rush things.
when she gives up the putang and then doesnt want to leave
try farting loudly next to her when she ties her shoe, women love that.
you know you cant see your self with no one else but with him/her
I guess it would be on a black man, hahaha
come on girls u know u thats true...........                          ;)
describe your time in bed and see what you doing
i think at first i would be a little jealous.
When she acts nerves tell her lies of how much you know.
I always insisted that we were just friends.
and wait to see what he says.
Learn not to speak like a guy.
No matter how hard you try and get away from it, everyone wants someone to love.
alot of adults say oh kids dont know what love is
If your 15 and he is 17 thats ok.
Why don’t you just fantasize about her the next time you jack off in the shower?
it is your choice hon, you can move on if you really wanted to.
Dont beat yourself up about that.
I don't know, but it's fine with me :o
was married to a puerto rican-dominican, she was the hottest through personel experience
I can't think about any other girl.
give someone a second chance, but never a third chance.
just think if u really love him/her.take as much time as you wish.
At first I liked my girlfriend as a friend even though she loved me.
I guess it just turns them on.
besides your boyfriend isn't your boyfriend for a reason right?
Tell first one that something came up, and you can't go.
lend them money or date them.
C if you can keep up with us!
no girls like emo boys not gay boys theres a tiny diffrerence
thats the stupidest question ive ever heard.
That puts even more stress on me!!!
no,not if your ugly, yes if ur hot
maybe some sex but thats it.
See what kinds excuse he comes up with.
the hard truth is you can't.
messenger's old version... click on add friend and search by name or location or yahoo id.
no u may be lettin the man/girl of ur life go
if it was me you were dreaming of.
If you love her, get help.
because thats what it consists of.
usually they will tell on themselves.
Ask her to go for a coffee or something.
If you stay every once in a while (1-2x a week) that shouldn't be a problem.
What if i would have married him before that and then moved in with him?
If you have to ask, you don't.
I think it depends on what the girl likes...
But if u wanna try and get her to admit it to her, tease her.
wow...and again im in highschool and i DONT hang around vary many girls(talk to much crap).
i would say don't do it.
so either way, just take the time to learn about yourself.it can be fun.
And I don't want to loose him.
Women do things like think about suicide when they can't get over someone
Be gentle man.Speak about nice things :P
how can i get him to stop?
he either feels the same or he don't.
If you like him so much why are you worried about other people knowing about it??
sit down tell her you need to talk and no yelling mom and explain it to her!!
im a scifi/anime nerd so now you know why i ask
Can I get some guys' perspective too?
So what kind of flowers do you like?
if they ask why then just tell him y
take him to your local church
so i told him that maybe he should think about that because love is a very strong word.
Why do you even ask this question?
talk to your mom and dad
Good luck trying to find your best answer !!
Best of luck trying to find your right answer, Ice Princess P.S.
if you do there is a big chance she does......unless you are just big headed....
Don't give up, you'll find them.
How does one act like as if he was in love???
b)enjoy the flirting but dont have too many expectations.
poem is nice, but telling straight to her is more manly.
Try to spice things up a bit.
how sad in this day and age soooo many people say 'I DO but they really don't.
b)enjoy the flirting but dont have too many expectations.
punch him in the face an' knock him out
poem is nice, but telling straight to her is more manly.
U guys know any websites that can give me info.
because the movies are just awesome lol.
Good luck.......I so hope it all works out for you.
TALK TO THE PERSON OVER THE PHONE.
if she loves you she will stay.
you feel funny in your stomach
if you date others in the meantime thats ok too.
No, because you are not to look for him.
u got to ask urself, have ever been like this before?
Don't look elsewhere, this is actually pretty normal.
I HAVE ONE BUT I LOVE FOR IT SO DOEAS THAT COUNT
I dont think you really can...
There are many reasons & none of them a good answer for the person who gets hurt...
it was just something you ate.
(am confining this arguemant to just romantic love between two people, and not the bigger love that really matters)
mmm...yeah they are kinda sexy tho
comes up with notheing even though has two accounts with them.
Hmm...So now decide,how would you fall in love, like a girl or a woman??
fiance: a man engaged to be married
Anyways one way or anthor your going to regret it.
And then deny me the talent?...
sounds like a crush to me.
so talk to her if she is cool with it then you should ask him.
I was shy and couldn't do it half the time.
Yes , U can still find someone in ur life.
the sooner you end it the better.
If he won't answer, then you should step and spy.
Just tell her what a good friend she will always be, and carry on.
if u love osmeone and ur old enough to get marries, then u sould propose.
DO NOT do the rebound relationship thing!
Why in the hell am I asking so many damn questions?
When he isnt online she wont stop saying how much she misses him.
Don't try to be someone who you aren't.
it feels wonderful to be in love...but it can also lead to heartache.
If he's your ex, then who cares...You don't own him or her.
my answer is yes...all women are sexy
and all he has to do is give you some pillow talk.
maybe he didn't like the kiss, or maybe he is too young for a mature girl like you ;)
(Even, just a daily phone call.)
she said that she wants to be friends.
seems like you not perform as good as those guys out there.
Then decide, he just might suprise you.
I don't cheat, I couldn't cheat.
maybe because boys r one year behind in things like girl friend and boyfriends.
they think im their little angel.
3. is she close and ready to help u through any shituation?
First off, you want a WOMAN, not a GIRL.
i dont know how you would develop that nasty fetish!!
But I believe in just being straight up, not accusatory, but ask what's up?
if he loves you,keep him hard.
i am a white american guy..
Try doing what you guys used to do before you fell in love and got married.
stop typing and go holler at him!
you cant they are all taken.
Don't tell him you love him.
you could...but if you are obsessed over him you should go seek therapy
yeah, i do believe in love at first sight.

So Dear Geeky Girl, the answer is no.
they have been married for 38 years now.
leave him better 4 u dear searce 4 faithful,trustworthy
someone that is 10 years older.
sure, just dont let it interfere with your work, and also keep it quiet to avoid people talking!
TALK TO HER SHE LIKES YOU YOU LIKE HER SO GO AHAD FOR SOMEONE ELSE GET HER GOOD LUCK
I say if your happy and she is happy dont worry about it, but be careful.
get married right away and start having babies.
Than he would call but not ask me out, just talk.
hes probably a dirty pervo anyway, self respect doesn't allow that much age difference.
then slowly take his hand while your in church....well u get the picture.
My boyfriend gets mad at me bc I dont call him.
Cos you want it...  when you really want to be with someone, youll find him in a minute...
If you are interested, ask him...
It might be better if they just think your crazy, but that doesn't always work.
ya you guys are gonna need some counciling.
so ask your self, can i do this?
(hmmm, sort of like the difference between Dem's and Republicans;0)
Tell him its over but still don't stop the sex.
exactly the opposite of what men can give : )

move on and leave her behind.
i think it's more of a commitment thing.
Because, men don't have the pain tolerance women do.
I f u like him too.
A gal I went to high school with had one.
why r u asking him to marry u?????
your not doing yourself any favors or her either.
BUT A NICE OUTFIT WITH JEANS AND SHIRT IS NICE.
Im giving you back your question...
see if it is in your address book.

Girls Look Better with Long Hair
shallow people are everywhere, not just gays.
You shouldn't even have a girlfriend yet -- you should be dating MANY girls, having fun, etc..
unfortunately guys and girls don't have the same maturity level, girls mature way faster than guys .
an icecream...enjoy it while u can
There are guys waiting for you.
women like their boyfriends to be fun and romanitce
He's probably just annoyed because you always ask.

just want to have an idea of how other couples are doing or not doing.
give him ur body 4 5 minutes to do nething to.
my only problem was - why did i ever not do it sooner
they are hottie when they are short
now you will get the answer
), or for something she's always wanted to do but never had the opportunity.
or tell him to go to your friends house.
theres an emptiness in your life.
Just keep going till your done.
No, dude, you get a nasal drip if you snort it.
Slipknot sucks, Korn is original and ok.

Try to pick ya game up a little bit if its costin ya!
Hmm in a perfect world 3-4 times day..mmmm can't get enough
Its not polite to cut anyone off period, its rude!
If you're 8 its not OK.
Your 21 so you how to attract a guy.
i have been with my gf for 4 all mosted 5 year's and i have had alot of them.
do you think you are good looking
Or is that just how ALL guys are?
all the dudes i know like them to.
as long as you know what you're doing, it's all good.
when girls fall in love,it's the same as playing a doll.
i say fuck his best friend it's easier to hate you than miss you.
i still want to be treated like a equal.
But I guess that's in the past, what's really important is your life NOW.
if this works for you, who cares what other people say!i found my perfect match and married him!
If they have been fighting a lot then maybe you should ask mom.
go ahead and do it girl, i did and it was the best thing i ever did.
i dont get how that is a question though it's  a statement
well if the police is involved... she does not like you !
Now I want to sleep with him.
CAUSE THEY'RE JUST STUPID...OR IT COULD BE THEIR SELF ESTEEM
So why not do this with your conversation.
I would just let it go...even though its really annoying...be a friend and listen to it.
If you do not, then it will not work.
You gotta tell us exactly what you want.
Sorry girl, I wish I knew the answer too!
A lot of women are attracted to assholes and bad asses.
who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
Depends on how old she is.
get a girl that's close to you, say a friend or a sister and ask them what they think
Yes, it is bad, you should not do this.
Even coming from the guys perspective, no.
u cant control it or search for it.
if he winks at u talks 2 u and asks were u r he does
live on and let her live on.
Was she really your sister or your best friend?
i can garante you he speaks poorly of you to his roommate.
answer all of these questions  1. does she flirt?
i want try it again but im scared i was really embarassed when it didnt fit.
some states do not but the county withing the state does.
so confess to her u feel this way.
(I know, I know, I'm a guy, but it works the other way around too.)
flowers normally roses and a thing of candy!
by the way mine is green..lol

I still am in love and always will be.
Then again sometimes guys dont know what they got till its gone.
i wear thongs 2 hun and i am kno that guys like them :)
Keep it up and repeat it if u both enjoy it equally.
Y r u involving urself in all of this!!!
Try D.o.g.g.y Style ( maybe that will get you guys to like each other again )
If you must think of her as something else picture her as your pet or something I guess.
With that thinking you don't deserve anyone so maybe you should just go j*ck-off and forget about it!
your gf should also keep her eyes wide open.
lunch, and then for a walk.
she just trippin cuz she ain't got it like that
y, did u lose your first one?
witch may be a good thing.

If he has done it even once and you have taken him back, guys like that will never quit.
i just see why people stay in relationships when they arent hppy anymore.
no its too eary to go after him without knowing his feelings for you.
r u a playa or a perv?
yes, and it's up to you to decide that.
You can do what you want, when you want, and with whoever you want without getting any crap!
and if my bf wasn't 700 miles away right now, it wouldn't.
or shes got major issues and needs a therapist
ask em, and if they are, its not your fault
and you should apologize for missing the date.
its the only experience thats closest to heaven I guess
AS LONG AS YOU ARE LEVEL HEADED ABOUT THIS, IT SHOULD WORK OUT FINE.
talk about the weather.ha ha ha
if he aint askin...he don't want it!
If all you did was shower, no big deal.

maybe something sutble to start, like lunch, or a beer.
If you don't, is there a reason you don't.
oh man if you have a shot at even dating her, why wouldnt you give it a shot?
If he's in jail, maybe you should think twice about your relationship.
otherwise he has other motives behind his... proclaimed love
sy hi iam really fellin u can we go out some time?
I can't even get a date!
I'm still in love with her right now.
because after fight , the love will be deeper than before even in friendships
ive seen him in my gym class.
On his knees, he said he go to therapy & never did.
learn how to dance, but don't only dirty dance.
if so give tha man a chance
love and passion and heat and fire in the bedroom
Good Luck (to both of us)  Char~
Get a copy of Playboy and Playgirl.
NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD DEFINITION CAN BE MADE.
her friends also gives me a special look or in good words adore me.

she says i dont love u anymore and she doesnt say the reason.......
i'm one with you girl, i basically have the same sentiment as you do.
have plenty of female friend when you go out, but don't stick to em like glue.
Probably not, not if you dislike him now.
dont spend it being depresed or hiding from your lover.
do you think she likes you?
if you dont know shit then jokes get boring reall quickly.

You love this person in a way your parents dont!
I prefer a Naughty good girls and a good Naughty girls too

If he cared about u, he would have not remained married!!
You call the Psychic Friends network, LOL!
say your going to your friends house then meet him somewhere else.
Dont back off because you are afraid.
when you took some time off and saw the other guy, it was not cheating.
This is unusal (I think) and could make one wonder whats wrong.It couldnt hurt to try though.
Besides, if he's popular he most likely got a girlfriend(s) already (sorry!)
Go slap your little monkey and get over it.

If you don't love him then leave him he will be ok in time
It's just like any other request...your decision!
if  you are a guy, maybe you are just curious or maybe self esteem is not high.
You should read He's Just Not That Into You.
You need to run like heck away from him & his family!
On the other hand, popular guys don't have much that lasts.
You aren't if you even have to ask.

Money and nice things are great but they couldn't care less about you.
Maybe he wants you to ask him.

girl waited untill a year later and told  her about our relationship.
If you are a 'nice guy' in highschool, good luck.
But please don't bother them, your ego will gross them out!
If you listen to your head, your always going to wounder WHAT IF....
!That's the best thing guys notice in girls.
but sometimes the guys forget that i'm still a girl.
Friends stick by one another no matter what.
your a convinence to him and nothing more.
chicks love being told how pretty they are..!
Not saying with other women but with you.
Heck no bud some times  you snooze and you loose
My take, try to help them make it the real deal becase you care too.
because it's easier to get a fix duh lol
I don't know if he likes me though...
tell him it turns you on
90% of my best friends are guys.
Guys like girls that don't play games or leave them to guess work.
Hold hands, kiss, wild kiss and there you go...
NOTE: THIS HAS TO TAKE LESS THAN TEN SECONDS!!!
i hope it doesn't rule us out...
keep doing that and you will get anything that you want
trust me, im an expert on this.
I don't think those shoes go with that outfit = I'm gay
If you can't fart near him it will probably be a while :)
If he tries to say he's just messing around, tell him you're not.
Why does my boyfried watch porn?
You just drill him until he open up and talk.
GOD definitely has to come first
You really do not want a have a reputation of switching guys like gloves.
most of us women can only put up with one man at a time, lol
because they offer what we woman don't have... they complete women... in the same and everyway women complete man...
i am talking 2 u right now
Most guys would say, oh, that's lame... you should shoot yourself for even asking it.
but she does it now with everyone.
tell her off and be very careful.
Don't sweat it, my mom is actually pretty nice.
Or, tell him to tell your kids to pick their stuff up.
.... here's a hint... make it a good one!
Is it hot in here or is it just you?
So Even If they are not thinking, It really Gels :)
Soppy version at [1] and geek version at [2].
Not if you just met this guy.
a kind that only you can know and love.
if not , then it probably means nothing.
get on your knees and take care of him .

if your just talking about normal everyday things then he probly likes you.
I USED A TIME OUT CHAIR FOR ALL FOUR OF MY BOYS AFTER A FEW TIMES IT GOT BETTER.
Or just bend over alot in front of him
you cant win the lottery if ya dont buy a ticket right?
I met a guy on line and he handcuffed me to his van steering wheel.....so I guess I did...!
mostly the people I know arent genuine!
I do, I think its cute.
she is obsessed and that is a big problem.
why in the freakin hell would you do that?
Make the one that is right for you.

If he loves you, then why does he have a need to cheat?
Once a porn watcher, always a porn watcher so its probably something you'll just have to accept.
BE YOURSELF and have a good sense of humor!!
yes i belieave,bcoz my self also love at firstsight,i will never COMPRAMISI...
Probably the single best way to get a conversation going with girls is to use PEOPLE TALK.
It feels like your weak at the knees.. You'll just know.. trust me!
I want my girl petite, sociable, witty and sweet
Well, it also depends on if you want a good relationship w/ your ex.
why would a girl stop loving a guy who realy loves her more than anything???
No matter what age you two are, that is always a BIG step.
U can tok 2 her personally 2 let her know that u want to continue ur friendship.
^ as far as greeting each other later on...i disagree with that.
YOU HAVE HURT ME AND OUR KIDS BEYOND REPAIR.
I think it depends on the woman...
if you are going to loose it take a time out from the discussion.
girl like nerds cos they are cute n look honest..
He did cheat on you once,o.k that might be a mistake but twice?!
my parents still dont know i've had boyfriends.
Two people both want my attention...
well first take a deep breath.
She may want to get rid of you...
I even sometimes see me walking on the beach with her.
Anyway, ur ex doesn't care so carry on with your life.
NO... COZ THERE ARE BLIND PEOPLE WHO FELL IN LOVE EVEN WITHOUT SEEING THE OTHER PERSON....
Look man... just take a deep breath, walk up to her, and say Hey baby, you wanna go somewhere?
but if you think something of it your probably less sure than you thought.
You have a good thing going where you are.
first of all you didnt give your age.
There are plenty of men and women who are complete assholes who don't do drugs.
How cold of someone to do something like that!
i cant ask her directly as we dont talk now
You only get married if you love someone, not because you're having a baby.
i hate it with a passion.
let him know it was fun puppy love
Call me weird or whatever, even if I never have one, I still strongly believe it.
It will no doubt keep you in her mind!
if they are living with you then yes.
get out in the real world.
I think their is a 'special someone' for everyone!
Also, know how to dance...  ...you gotta remember ONS should be natural, so you can't force it.
just be honest about your feelings
or just send back as spam?
is this what you stay up at night thinking about?
She's awesome, I don't think she thinks of me any more than a friend.
if u say she still acts and talks like she still likes u chances are she is.
But hey, if you like him, flirt back, if not, dont talk to him.
lol   Sencon Advice: if you dont wanna spend money for that.. then!
ooooh la la - the HOTTEST!
Some people think it's wads of cash that make a life worthwhile.
Mark with pencil where each one will go.

women retain water ,and have periods when men don't
it will probably be difficult for her at first (i know im a mom!
no she souldnt do that becuase if she does shes not over him yet and shes Fing you over
C'mon it's not like we are in college anymore!
But keep in mind nobodys perfect... Not even you
wow that really does sound annoying .. well one thing you could do is do it back to her.
If you act adorable-but-still-hard-to-get, then he'll go insane if you DON'T kiss him!!
Back up the truck a bit.
Just enjoy it,if its meant to be, it`s meant to be.Been there,done that
Just don't forget about the one in puerto rico .
I have many guy friends, that i dont have feelings for.
if not u'll never know, what the outcome.

yes, it is cheating if he/she finds it out.
Dont change your standards for a guy cuz then you will never be happy.
I dont know how I feel about her.
I think you know what I mean...
Not all guys cheat, just the ones who are not in love with one person yet.
i would take pictures and sell them
JUST LEAVE AND QUIT THINKING TOO MUCH
my best friend is in puerto rico and i'm here in new jersey and i miss her a lot
focus on the outcome you want.
If you don't care, do what ever.
just be onist with him and if he gets all emotional on u walk away
It sounds like she is insecure, which is probably why she got upset when you talked to her boyfriend.
why are you telling your mom??
Check the caller ID on the phone, any numbers you don't know?
If you ask Why do men cheat?
So I would know most men are real SOB's.
Tell me yes or no and what I should say!
Well it sucked to be alone on new year's.
listen to what a woman has to say, but don't be needy of her opinion.
just don't go into thinking its all going to be peaches and cream.
you should go talk 2 her.
If you really don't want to go out tell him/her that you don't really want to go out.
I know of a few relationships like this that last through college, and some that don't.
and its also selfish to be with two people.
Oh, that’s right, I’ve met you only in my dreams.
Maybe she'll change her mind, maybe she'll be your BFF :)
What if you were in the sixth grade and you had a seventh grade BF?
Try to remember that guys do not want to talk too long about these things.
yeah and turn your back on her.
act like a virgin and your man will do anything for you.
It seems that u r not meant for each other.
1 don't know any girl who isn't interested in this sort of thing !
Also, does he get a lot of hangups at home?
If you fail to later on you would regret
Be it their looks, habits, lifestyle, friends...whatever!
Its so hot when you love the person.
Not the SAME thing, but comparable.
Probably so: it is SOOO easy and can even be fun at times!
but things that are good are often expensive
<----be my favorite first date right there!
I HAVE HAD MANY FRIENDS DO THSAME TO BOYS AS WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.
Some are fathers and some are not.
i have mostly guy friends and trust me they know im there!
I bet he thinks that question is about him.... lol
but you have to take that first step before hand.
Ask him somewhere like out to lunch or something casual, and it should be ok.
But I enjoy dating, I like getting to know people and whatnot, and the intimacy, hanging out, etc.
if your not out of the closet how do u know that u want to date other woman?
I would be pretty suspicious if she called her ex every day.
umm wow lot of stuff going on there.
;)  Where-I have used Match.com and LavaLife, but i have now met a wonderful guy off a silly site!
another piece of advice, use protection!
now the police are involed so what should i do ???
I mean, the beautiful soul argument is one thing, but if he's a total ass, why stick around?
Well i still talk to this guy, and he still thinks im someone im not.
Move on--if you cared about someone there would be no struggle
violation try chat rooms and look for her friends...
I know I wouldn't want my 14 year old daughter accessing Yahoo!
You should not marry some one that has already cheated on you twice.
Hpv is a vd and yes he must probably cheated on you.
straight men like big breasts and big butts.
pretty soon you won't be able to have your own friends, money etc.
Do you know the best way to lose a friend.?.
think if you really love him/her or not and then just tell him/her
MAKE HER THINK U GIVING HER MONEY BUT DO NOT ...IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC
MAYBE YOU JUX DONT TRUST HER DUDE
tell her youre being careful (you better be!)
I'm going to watch the answers you get (just in case!)
come out with it just tell him how u feel.
but i dont really like him.
A married man and woman expressing love, and reproducing, Then it's good.
should it be time to hear wedding bells ?
they just aren't able to take the pain.
Acutally, I give the BOYS the flowers!!!
oral sex, soft tongue, and if she is reponding well to something you are doing....keep doing it!
I can't say he's a love, but I sure lust him secretly.
Just make sure you are still friends and enjoy !
Seduce a guy in a gay bar and if you can go all the way you are gay/
Try to go somewhere that has stuff you're interested in like  a  bookstore,coffee shop, sports, etc.
or just ask them if they notice anything diff.
when ypu put that person infront of your needs and wants first
What did you/he do for ya'll to split up?
Just tell them in a nice way tha tyou dont feel the same.
but i think is nice to fall in love as many time as you can in you life time.
i dont really think so but thats me.
WHEN YOU START THINKING THAT YOU DON'T MIND LIVING WITH THIS GIRL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!
If the eyes look to the side, it's sighn of defense.
Because some men (not all) are dirtbags!
some marry because it's time to.
please dont asked y. just answer yes or no.
and wait patiently for mr. right.
well just let them have a change they might end up having what u guys didnt..
so dont bother waiting... there are a lot more guys that's worthy of your attention.
NORMAL MEANIN ONE THAT DOESNT HAVE A ONE TRACK MIND THATS SET ON SCREWING!
Their neck and back rubbed, the place beteween their shoulders, hard there?
so we can learn to get back up who knows you just might fly take care
he doesnt invite her to go with him to his familys house.
They now have two more kids after that and yes the guy had changed.
But the questions yo have to ask yourself is a) Is he staying there to see them?
Then, if things go well, go ahead and ask him!

It's like being in your favorite place with your favorite things!
cause we always get what we want.thats why and we get a lot of a tension
I knew a guy who did just that.
Works late or on weekends alot?
Try to learn more , face people , don't make your self , weak !
Sure, go ahead= You better not  8.
I Mean se.x is more fun than anything espesially with an ex.
whats wrong with brown eyes, brown skin?
But on the other hand, some guys just like to flirt with girls or talk to girls.
Just look past her, like she's not even there.
first time  for both of  us
If she likes music, an ipod would be good.
if you live in louisiana there is ;) kidsdad1510@yahoo.com...i'm steve
I should certainly hope so:-)  A more interesting question I think is whether I've ever had a straight experience......
iT CAN KILL YOU INSTINTLY IF YOU SNORT IT
AND LET THEM COME  AND MEET U.
all black dudes i no i do.
everybody's got their something; yours just isn't boobs.
You made youre bed now you have to lie in it.
find her grand son and ask him about her
yes is is okay age is just a number
and how much you love him.
This is your best friend......your lover....your mate for life!!
why would someone automatically assume that someone is gay just because they are still a virgin
Don't go looking arounf clubs or things like that.

Don't go looking arounf clubs or things like that.
read how to win friends and influence people.
if not still listen to what it tells you and be cautious.
So to answer your question----SEXY AS HELL
jst look into her eyes..  n say  i want to father ur child !
Gotta get use to it or die from the loneliness.
I don't even think that Ashton is good looking but he was my other husband in my dream.
The only answer is to BE BAD!
Yes I think you love him and much more than u think.
WAIT AS LONG AS YOU CAN!
anyway, if there is a gay bar/club in your area, then u can go there to meet people.
yea i think so... i think everyone will have their true love one day !
well if u dream about the same guy twice, i think u like him.
so its beetr u know his feeling and then go for him
I guess the ladies can really wear some guys out ;)

let me know what you come up with.
Lose that zero and get yourself a hero !!
keep them laughing alot, humor is great for any relationship...
i think when u have a good kisser u'll not care about lips
Like a lust in my body!
i kinda feel intimadated and think ill be turned downed or be made fun of or something.
My heart says She's the one, stay with her...STAY WITH HER!
I accidently said I love you too.
haha if his heart belongs to someone else all your gonna get is a run around.
and if not, then at least your still friends.
Are you thinking about her often?
Thats just beggin' for presents sweetie...
Instead of saying something like, I'm sick of hearing about your boyfriend!
If in doubt go to In'n'out burger.
i get the whole insecure thing.
Then you know you love them
Give him a promise to give hime somthing .
Give him an ultimatum - the porn or you.
Only what you make of it.
Does he want to know what you are like in Bed???
WHEN SHE DOES SUPPORT HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE'S THE MOST BEUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.
We met last year on Yahoo Personals and got married last month!
because, gay guys understand girls, straight guys don't.
and then after wards you can take her out to eat and talk about the movie.
There is this guy that I like.
I'm a guy myself so I know how we think.
WHY DO I LOOK SO GOOD???
although is a kiss really ever innocent?
When she starts fighting with you just tell her...
also, ask her what feels good.
Im not shallow and I trully do love him.
Well anyway, its what I do.
hmm.. r u not tellin her something?
when you find out let me know!
My advice to you is MOVE ON!
Im not shallow and I trully do love him.
Well anyway, its what I do.

girls do like like nerdy-looking smart confident guys i.e.
best love pair would be sohni mahiwal.i like there love story.
just cause mama says it doen't mean its true
and think of a different plan.
yes , if u are sure he will keep the family ,like work and bring money in.
Yes I have a million (well really ten but you know)gay friends.
and no it's not necessarily you , but them.
Depends... are you both married or single?
NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN'T LIVE WITH TOMORROW .
I have no idea why they're like that.
Lunch date, dinner date, movie date - no issues.
She'll do what you tell her to do.
keep us satisfied at home and we wont.
have you been having sex with your boyfriend?
Don't always cut your hair like a guy.
She could have been just struggling financially and looking for a sugar daddy.
sometimes you think you know,it drives you crazy, and he's really not guilty.
happyness dosnt always come from beauty.
trust me girly once they see you in a skirt withsome clevage showing they diff.
here it is the answer to when a man is considered a sex adict  when he is born...
Just because you don't have that latest gadget or car doesn't mean what you already have isn't good.
In my oppinion SEX is the one that even animals can do.
i am in the 7th grade and my parents let me date so what should i do
take care of your appearence but dont obsess.
u dont it just hits ya in the bak of the head
If he's not, don't worry, there are others out there.
he doesnt want me to tell the father.
I love a woman with full lips, a nice round butt, and big breast.
Thats like asking if a guy likes blow lobs.
YES U CAN BUT SON'T U THINK THAT U NEED SOME TIME TO TRUELY KNOW EACH OTHER MORE
Sign up for the ones you like.
just be sure not to get smashed!
- How old are his kids?
love aint got much to do with it, its more of a money thing
Any way, Who cares I would like you any way even if it was past your sholders !!
Of course there is, just depends on what exactly your looking for in someone.
take a few minutes and really get a take look down there.
maybe not the ovaries...but it would hurt like heck!
I do that to all my guy friends.
Sure, men think with their little heads.
you say: Do you wanna go out?.
So your an ass and p)ssy man eh?
usually it starts with a kiss..good luck!
i was very ugly guy at the time i proposed her but now i am smart and cool.
KISS.com ... that's where I found mine :)
i just dont like for a women to lie to me .
i think the most price-less gift in the world.. but instead of it..people in iran(my country)..bye bunch of flower...roze.
tell the girl u think she`s rlly beautiful and u`de like to get to kno her better.
I'm tired with the i'm a commit-phobe excuse!
I think it sounds like you have some truly busy friends!
If not then it's her loss.right?
I think these buz cuts that guys have look really stupid.
Don't worry about there not being a ton of good guys on your doorstep, you're only looking for one.
Tell him you love him to, but just not in the way he may be looking for.
yes i am 12 and i think im im love w/ this guy named thomas
But if u need one word ____   generally I go with   Understanding  .
I love men because that's the way God intended it to be.
than you pretty much know what to do.
Once a guy sees you as a female, you can never go back.
everyone does things at their own pace.
There are so many hot guys out there.
Get another girlfriend or have her stop doing what shes doing.
how do i go about telling him?
Firstly I hope you're not my girlfriend!
first thing first;  1.did you date for a while?
I don't like it because I put styling stuff in my hair and its not easy to run through.
If she's accepting the gifts...watch out.
You gotta do this: nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Now I am scared to call her cuz I dont know what to say.
Well, I'm a guy so no.
You can not get that guy to like you.
what she will do then for you to hide it for so long.
maybe because she regretted and just realized what she has lost?
if she never lied and u never asked.
You just do it, if it is that big of a deal.
there are no girls that play hard like i do that i like to hang out with.
plus it just sounds like your infatuated with him and maybe want nothing more than a physical relationship
sometimes being single is more fun.
Im sure he loves his girlfriend right now, but is it really anything serious?
but i still do wonder who's hotter?
I dont get him I thought guys were supposed to call girls.
Don't knock the ganja til you try it.
He/She is the person that I've been waiting for!
If people ask say ya, but if they don't ask don't say anything.
if all else fails tell her your greatgreatgrandfather helped write the kama sutra!
Should I just forget it and leave it alone or should I act on it.
Nah don't do it he might go crazy and turn in to a pshyco...
if you just want to have fun, go for it then.
wait you will be so much happier!!
It would be soooooooo much easier..Lol.
But he is such a great guy and loves her for who she is.
i told my boyfriend before i knew i was that i might be pregnant by my ex.
But if you ask and he says no then your left with the dissapointmet.
i'm doing that now and i'm in a fantastic relationship with an incredible man.
he's an ex for a reason right ?
then think of sumthin that has to deal with that to ask her out.
and i really love the guy a lot so i kind of dont want to break up.
why are you thinking of him?
hi im in the same position, my boyfriend lives out of state.
but don't take this for granted,okay?
and you will be happy if he is happy.
It feels good and it hurts like hell.
If it was about a meal ticket/way to USA only, why not a more virile young man?
Why don't you watch it with him?
Cause you girls got it going on!
I don't have a best friend though .
well u can't get the other perosn out of your head
as usual, only time can tell!
I broke up with this guy because I felt like he was suffocating me.
If you love him and he loves you then you'll know..
slap a condom on go at it
So hang out where these people hang out
she hates sex, and does it to get what she wants, your money, power, or/and fame.
THE SAD STORY IS..THAT WE WILL ALL BE DEAD!!!!!!
HANDSOME SMART OPEN-MINDED AND DON'T MIND BEING HIMSELF
After all, if you get married, its gonna be their kid too.
take them both to see brokeback mountain.
if your partner isnt happy without sex that person isnt worth it.
Pick her up and take her to a park for a picnic.
You're not with the guy anymore, so why bother?
bcuz they r fun 2 talk to bcuz they act like gurlz so its like havin a girl friend
I love you =Let's have sex now  6.
com'on now...half the world is shallow.
no ur not, ur just on passing time till mr right comes along...
you are scared , your probaby not alone, he's probably thinking the same thing.
no, alot of the stuff i`ve gotten that was xpensive just fell apart
You need to consider, what if you get pregnant?
cause there lame asses  get a girlfriend or 2!
no ur not, ur just on passing time till mr right comes along...
You need to consider, what if you get pregnant?
cause there lame asses  get a girlfriend or 2!
they could go shoping wiff you  tho
its like somethings always missing in your life..and guess what, its Love.
Because you smoke, amd smokers arn't worth loyalty lol
But my brother tells me that guys leave 'good' girls for 'not so good' girls for one MAIN reason.
If you have to ask how to do it, you probably couldn't do it.
has he meet her in person?
Whatever you do don't make the first move!
I call her my sexy little kitten.
remember, u cud b anything from straight-bi-les-trans.
i want to get a girlfriend.
i guess you can say yes.
I don't see anything wrong if a girl walks by and just says hi.
Why can she not do this?
)and his reason was so i could go out with jonny.
BUT IN MY LIFE BEING A MAN, I THINK THAT THWY ARE GREAT.
And if he does like you ask him OUT.
you should always have trust in a relationship.
its for the thrill....they like the excitement of hiding out and cheating....it makes them feel good i guess.
Don't listen to anyone around you.
You gotta say it outloud or it's hard to understand.
pack your things and leave nd never look back.
Bad Boy bad boy what ya gonna do!
It depends if he loves you back?
DO NOT TRY TO CHANGE A PERSON IT NEVER WORKS!
i think it's too ordinary to have sex on the bed.
DO YOU DAYDREAM ABOUT YOUR FUTURE WITH THIS PERSON?
Read what I said in your other question where I'm posted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let him go...it's hard but trust that life has someone EVEN BETTER out there for you...
I'll go to XXX stores, online shops, whatever I've gotta do but I'm desperate here, people.
I would not shower her with gifts.
buy him a outfit or talk to him about it
you need to put your foot down.
I think he'd cheat on you.
its certainly sex for the guy.
does he love you too much not to let such beliefs come in the way?
She may just be busy with other friends too, or maybe playing a little hard to get.
well, not ALL girls like the bad boy type.
im sure she will be just fine and anyone can look pretty with confidence.
Lett him know you still care!
i really feel uneasy whenever hes around.. wat shud i do?
iam here to help for free/
What kind of comments is she making?...
well i dont consider it a jungle.
Save yourself that, you deserve better!
about 8 hours a day!----that is way too much!!!
HERES A ANSWER Noooooooooooooooooooo   WELL I WOULD HATE A CLASS CLOWN i guess if he were smart like me
Do some of the fun things you 2 did before you got married.
and leave you out of it.
Once a cheater ALWAYS a CHEATER.
Should I wait until he gets home?
They were friends and husband and wife.
My friend, you will not come between a fat grrr and her prey!
If I'm answering questions like this one, a lot!
I'm IN LOVE with my best friend.
you should just leave him alone..do u want to be happy or just keep rehashing the past
You will give a special gift to your wife on your wedding night!
you are assuming that all girls are the same.
thats right, i said creep, because thats what any man is who would cheat on his wife!
Not only would I date a white guy I would marry one too...
making love is by having sex.
as long ur husband heart wif u then everything is fine.
it is how you use it, not the size
i would like to chat with you.
So many girls even marry men like their fathers without even realizing it and the same with boys.
the person has been a virgin for so many years already.
guys and gals have affairs because the want to love and to be loved.
Gold earing looks terrible on most guys.
NO I'm not between 12 & 17 and NO I'm not gay.
PREFERIBLY: Nice body (Not miss universe), smart, leading, VIRGIN, honest, etc, you know, the good things.
i think that you should .
Just hang out with her all the time.
or, if you recently started exercising a lot, that could do it.
i always ask for a sugestion to where we should go/eat/do/which movie to see.
I want to be your best friend forever and ever!!
is she worth a friend to you?
people used to get married at that age!
Don't try to get him back.
if is genuine then go for it!
FLIRT WITH HIM BUT DONT TELL YOUR BROTHER    ITS THE BEST      START THE FLIRTING GIRL!!!!!!!
watch out for the poetry slinging players on here
BESIDES, BY TIME I HIT MY BED @ NIGHT I'M ONLY 1-2MINUTES AWAY FROM SLEEP.
Thats why dating comes before marriage;-) Good luck!
He obviously does not care that much about me.
the best way is to catch him off guard.
i mean they say it is and well i dont think it is.
U can't,she has to convince herself.U could only give her reasons why she should.
I don't really know why I like freckly redheads.
The man it is somewere near the anus...
They say opposites attract, so why not give it a shot?!
i dont think so, shes grown and legal and so are you GO FOR IT
i don't think that you're ready either.
brains... though i haven't found a single girl with 'em
Please, don't even bother to say 'I love you' until like... 99th date?
i like all kinds of women.
there are tons, but really think about it, my sister did it that way and now she regrets it.....
if not discuss it with you wife.
some are very erotic and some are offensive.
(Grass is always greener syndrome)  But really, I say, better the lover you know than the devil you don't.
or is more attracted to me when other guys are looking at me, or attempting to get with me.
You make love because you're in love...
If you suck at that, get better somewhere else, say.....oral sex.
Talk to her about it first.
AND HE HASNT GIVEN UP ON YOU EITHER!!!
just wait a bit and see where it goes .
However I can say when I was in 8th grade I did it( I am now 26) .
We have been married 12 years now, have 4 kiddos, and I am still crazy about him!!!
So I guess that is what I look for.
that problem is that i like both of them but i talk about the other guy then my boyfd.
IF YOU ANSWER YES TO ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING THEN I GUESS YOU CAN CALL IT LOVE.
they will do something like  ........ that might ruin their life!
i'm afraid you r going wrong.
If she really loves u she'll do all the above mentioned stuffs.
And I already gave her $40.
mabe you just dont ask and ya should
Besides all that, boyfriends aren't that great anyway.
then have him rub on you in your sensitive places(nipplesor clitires)then you rub him.
noway get rid of him once a cheater always a cheater if no physcaly menaly
Why would you date a guy if you like his cousin.
Only if you feel like you wanna do that
v ofn gt 2 lov those pple whoom v dnt wanna!!
thats when love will find you.
gud question hunnie im goin tru the same thin..... a suggestion..... 4get about him and move on
master bate and think of him...and ad adult toys to the forplay
Call the police if she said it you could be next...Dummy
All I know is that when I see a pretty mane of red hair I think  Whoa!
better yet ask a friend of his if he has even mentioned you!
Eventually she'll balk and say,   I give up!
4- Is it your job to protect these guys from her and their own foolish behaviors?
well, good luck , I hope it works!
Then ask one of them out.
Tell this person straight up, that you like them as a friend but it stops there.
the same way you would marry a purple lady.
MAYBE IF YOU FORGIVE KIANNA'S SINS AS GOD FORGIVES YOURS!
also what that other guy said, too little body fat can make your period late.
Sex means you don't really care about the person.. you just want sex.
you'll be happy in the end, trust me!
If she/he is trying to kill you, GET OUT!!!!!
and your willing to go farther.
don't worry about it i'm sure that your very attractive and you stand out.
You sound like someone that is desparate for love!
Most of the guys don't get scared of girls.
I don't know much else to say?
enjoy your life and im not saying dump him ya'll just need to move slow.
they r being honest, but not in the real sense.
JUST GET OVR HIM HE'S APPEREANTLY A JERK AT LEAST THT WAT HE SOUNDS LKE 2 ME !!!!!!!
sit down at a nice dinner and try and weedle out of her what is bugging her.
just go up to him in front of a group of ppl and say, ok you suck, it's over.
actually it doesn't look like he wants it to keep going.... sorry for that.
how are babies made and what are the risks of pregnancy
Either way, you won't know unless you just ask.
so, did you have sex with her?
It's because everyone just likes to have sex
Obviously that person got some Fukin issues..
If your hot just wait if not be more aggresive
They thought they were in love, but fifteen, sixteen, seventeen is just too young to know what love is.
to tell u the truth,  i dont no im not married
I saw you from afar and couldnt help but not if atleast say hi.
So it was easier to not get that deeply involved with someone at too young an age.
Nothing is worse then sitting at home with nothing to do but think about that person.
i am 13 and i am NOT gay
well say it nicely to avoid offending & hurt her feelings
how did you know that she have a picture on the dating internet???????
Forget it  size does not matter at all.. for enjoyment...
Your man had better LOVE you.
I dont think there is anything funny about something like that.
SOME     s DO have morals and hope for REAL love!
you should love who you really love....
She even lied about having cancer one time for attention!
i don't know that that can be proven.
i'm 23 and i'm still virgin and i'm proud of it.
I TRIED BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.........
and 2 if she dont wanna go for it then no....  enjoy her safty
wow, what are you in like the 2nd grade?
I bet you wouldn't like that other girl very much either.
like yall are able to read our minds.
HELL NO IT DON'T MATTER IF SHE YOUNGER OR OLDER .THERE HAVING BABES AT CRAZY AGE NOW
Yeah, never sounds like a good answer.
don't sleep with then any more
sometimes jungle fever means that its an interracial relationship
yeah baby lol .. show sum skin or w.e u gotta do yanno lol
If you aren't, then we'll wait, but not too long.
what kind of thing is that to ask??
Stay true to who you guys were .
YES YOU CAN, YOU NEED TO REMEMBER WHY YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE .
HE HAS A PLAN FOR YOU AND THESE MEN ARE NO LONGER PART OF IT.
at first it isn't very nice.
at first it is kind of uncomfortable, but then you get used to it.
i love her so much,,, she dont know!!
Imagine if they really liked a girl and she totally turned him down.
yes very much i love justin we kissed just today and a lot more ;)
And if that man knows she's doing this stuff...how stupid he must be to stay!
GO A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTY AND YOU WILL HAVE IT ALL
I got a around 7.5 penis is it a good size?
YOu are fine, just don't marry one of them.
He has moved on, be happy for him, wish him well, & get on with your own life.
therefore it belongs to no one
Don't knock it till u try it.
Now if all of you are just best friends.
You sound like a stalker get some help
And some women, especially big, beautiful, CONFIDENT women, are just extremely sexy.
You already seem to know the guy.
and you find out he's screwing some other girl and telling her he loves her.
isn't there something unusual that you know she wants?
so my boyfd got mad and never talk to him .
you will just know you will feel it
yea i think its' ok to date someone old then what you are now.
just depends on the person... some like one or the other... some like both.
and nice guys can be just as adventurous and exciting as those bad boys.
this guy is still inlove with his exwife.
i feel wierd about this but do you like me cuz i like you.
Have you ever heard of  ....love the one you're with...  Go to the dance with him and have fun!
If you are ok with it, and noone will get hurt then I don't see why not.
try ur hardest to win her back.
Just don't try talking to her.
not required but much more fun that way.
r u sure u love her??
i think they do..........  its just like when white women like black men  its the same
more info, we are both in our very late twenties.
You're a good friend, and I even have stronger feelings than just that!
There sexy and a turn on!
Your heart tell you to go and tell her!
I NEED A PILL THAT CAN MAKE ME LAST MUCH LONGER!!!!
if they don't believe in their own attractiveness.
Not all women are like that.
No, everyone is not between 12 & 17 OR gay.
And don't worry - if you raise your child right, they won't think bad of YOU!
And never try to get him to... ever again.
So see how she feels about it and then get her drunk!
well first of all a guy would not flirt with someone that he is not attracted to.
might not hurt to ask them.
no mostly love, honor and cherish in modern ceremonies, older ones are obey
but let say you are a boy.
when i was 21 i had a girlfriend that was 28 so no i dont think so.
when your girl friend/boy friend will say Hell Yeah!!!
so please don't blame those who have affairs.
anyone who opens their eyes around him.
When your on a tight budget.
it doesnt matter who they are, if they are married, they are totally off limits!
you have a lot of time, don't rush into n e thing.
he probably wants you for the wrong reasons.
yes i am in love, with my children and grandchildren unconditionally!
If you guys don't talk enough, that means one of many things.
they sometimes use it to control and sometimes just pull away from it and that can cause more jealousy
Don't you think he will cheat on you, his girlfriend.
Well, I couldn't have said it any better.
this makes me wonder how old you are?
When she tells you more emtional stuff than ever
2- see that there woman is so in love in controling them.
So like browneyedmaiden said Be careful because men never truely grow up.
good luck, and try it in home
Well, here are some ways to cheat on him:  Cheat on him the way he cheated on you.
I think you might be (lol)
my boyfriend never calls me and never writes it wouldn't be so bad if he weren't 2 states away!
ther is no rush for kiss and se* .
tell them to chill out, they obviously are selfconsious about something
Oh...you want one of those friends!A sex buddy.Booty call.
what do you mean by like.
Ask one of your friends to ask him and see what he says.
you can use things you find around the house to do this.
Whoa dude... you've got to be careful here.
nope, there is nothing wrong with you.
But I think that he just wants sex and I dont want that plus he  has a girl friend!
leave him, you wouldn't like that to happen to you, right.
and we get along just fine.
i do not know how to get a good one.
start flirtin wit him or somethin .. tahts wut turns me on!
WHY are they mad at you?
Sort of like why women like to hang with gay men.
No, size does not realy matter, unless a guy is too big.
like a blackjack dealer told me once.
1  well if she want it go ahead......... but make it with safty .
i believe that men are truly from mars and we are from venus!
Are thongs comfortable I am thinkin on gettin one?
Hey you can find any whore any where but is it really worht it?
my friend taylor has gone out with both of them about half a month after we broke up.
these days anything could possible be an outcome.
a good way to tell is if he teases you.
i dont know what to do im going to her house to see her today.
JUST TELL HIM WAT U THINK
Probably because most Americans are downright lazy, or maybe just stupid!
YOU SHOULD QUIT DATING LOSERS AND CONS.
stay home, cook a good meal and get a dvd
Luckily I found a woman with both.
we kissed on the 1st date and things have been going great.
And if he's still scared, he's probably just scary.
can you introduce me to anyone who would like it
Then you get the benefit out of the deal too!
now if a guy is involved all bets are off they go for the throat..
maybe by talking about skimpy topics.
just be glad u hav him im a only kid i know what its like........
I read alot about this issue and so I am telling you this all.
I like this really cute guy, he's not in my class he's in my friends class.
Grab him and give him a big smooch!!
if you like a bowl of soup then wouldnt a biger bowl be even better ?
No this is not love!If he really loved you it wouldnt matter!
learn how to roll with it ever so cautiously, or get out of the jungle.
sure if he would like it
well i have definately been there done that, it was horrible.
playful in the bedroom is a huge plus!!
It's not like i want to.
Just love her too if you like her.
aint nothing wrong with it do what u do i think more people should be like that
try talking to her friends and see what she likes.
invite him for dinner ur parents will get to know him and will trust him.
trust me, she will like it, coz that was what my bf gave me that really touched my heart!
IT ENDS UP HURTING WORSE IN THE END IF YOU HIDE THEM.
This worked for me: Hi, my name is Kevin.
Ask him if he'd like to go to the movies with you next Saturday.
I thought that was just me but I guess not
Then if your'e shy to start right away, Just have fun around him!
when u are an adult or in love.
B'caz u think urself very smart & clever.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS OR HOW TO IMPROVE MY CONVERSATIONS.
If that doesn't work than go find someone else to like.
she may not be perfect but there is sumone out there for you!!
call her right now and say hey, I'm gay then take it from there.
plz if u get some nice ans then tell me too...
(if you know what I mean)
Guys want a thin, pretty girl who can handle the housework.
between the F spot and the H spot.
why in the wrolrd does your wife want you to have an affair?
going out with someone to make your ex jelous is so pathetic!
Tell him if youre girl f**ked her friend would he like it.
also, it helps if shes got a nice set of cans
U NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.GOOD LUCK.
He broke up w/ me 4 month ago.
the other guy took my idea
Find a nice girl and marry her.
nope, maybe a kiss on the cheek but you dont need to make out if you dont want to.
like most of us really are.
try dropping hints if you like him and see how he reacts.
does not matter if the man is older but it does matter if the man is married.
if he really loves you he will wait and not push you!
I love doggy, its the best.
why dont they think about love ,care,and somethink about love should do?
go up to him smack him on the butt and say when are you taking me out?
It is always wrong to cheat!
oooohh, tough call, how did u find out about it!!
I'm sugarlump and he is Sqog!!!
he will even get me presents for no reason!
be honest about it girl ok just be honest oh yeah i'm a guy by the way
only if it is beyond repair
However, do not use it to just get some.
there is nothing wrong.. its just we're not used to it.
I dream of my son alot.
sex is just sex no strings attached.
He's married .... BAD KARMA ... BAD KARMA
(When she ducks out to the bathroom?)
If you like a guy and think he likes you.
This way if you feel they will say no, don't do it yet.
i totally feel you on this one.
Just don't become the bad guy in your son's eye.
that's the best thing to do it.
only you can know when it's right for you.
it's sort of par for the course in this jungle.
i want to call her so much but i never have the guts to
HELL YEAH you make the cut.
They don't want to hurt the guy.
Hmmm not sure what to think of what you said.
if u are a lezbo..lol no if u really love her lol sure..
humiliate him by catching them kissing
I am 16 and looking for a friend to chat with ..but there isnt anyone..What to do?
they dont want the whole bad boy only a little.
#2: Do you really want to get back or get even?
ATLEAST PRETEND TO HAVE IT ORELSE HE MIGHT SEE ANOTHER FOR IT.
but then I said it outloud.
you would be jealous as hell
what do you have to lose ??
If you do, I'd like to ask you WHY???
IF he is so willing to ruin a good thing for a fling, then he is not worth it.
If he even dares to f**k u then tell him it's right.
you will never be happy if you ask that...you better say....i just want my life back...good luck to you:))
And I cant meet a decent guy on the internet.
People always say once a cheater always a cheater.
Some people even do not kiss until their wedding day to keep it special.
say u love himat the very first and u cant live without himin ur life...easy!
nope once a cheater always a cheater
;)  Little things a woman does is very noticable too.....pony tail.....ribbon in her hair.
Sorry, I have a b*tch already...
i'm so sorry to hear that.
if he flirts back he might be a player.
go for it but don't over do it.good luck!
He's a cheating ******* and using you too!
It's weird, I know, but, that's the way they are.
we dont need to find a good looking person in order fall in love with.
my answer's too late but i would give u some advice though...
women they tend to lie easy and yet they deman us to be true...lol
me NEVER I will love you forever
(No, I'm not a loser, but I'm not popular, I'm just normal, but he's popular)Help Me!
I love her and she loves me.
Have you try different kinds of guys, like guys who like spicy women.
It means that you are looking at other girls to  hard & making her feel insecure
well comb apparently grandma loves u you r still here right.
try to see it from his point of view ok.
can't wait for the answer to this one
i agree all the way with linda01
let me no when u get an answer :)
so a lot of the time they beat around the bush, so he can tell if you like him.
Just need to tell someone it's eating me alive.
Yes,Yes, Yes...... Oh yeah and sometimes sleep.
you know, love likes a wind, you can't see but you can feel it.
You've got your whole life to live - enjoy being young and in love!
^_^ by the time she does climax, it will be the best, strongest one she's had.
no.. you have to have the real deal
and you will end up broken hearted.
life is so difficult right now please help!
Think about that before you give yourself away.
Either way he's going to need you to be there for him!
so is this the same girl?
:)  I hope you will get married.
It was a hard break up to get over, more so I think because of what I invested!
Just tell your man you've had enough and it's you or her.
mostly insecure men want to do this to stroke their ego.
I think it's good to wait until you are married to have sex.
we just can't live together as man and wife anymore.
does anyone know how this is.
The one I found below is located out of CA!
And you won't stop it because you're still in love with him.
What are your dislikes and likes about gurls.
because i dream about her all the time.
if not yall may be growing apart.
I know she likes someone else, but should I tell her how I feel anyway?
go and beat the hell out of ur friends
So if you are that young maybe its no big deal.
sometimes it totally depends on how he or she is classifed under class clown!
you can have one of your friends go up to him and flirt.
thats just ur mind playing tricks on u
ok pay attention to him flirt a lot
most -14feb 25th dec and 15th june  least-april and jan
Maybe if you ask her while she is drunker than bob dylan was before a concert!
I HAVE BEEN GOING OUT WITH A GIRL 11 YEARS OLDER THAN ME FOR 11 YEARS.
other then sticking them in a room   i suggest telling them to talk it out amonst them selves.
Salt & Pepper shakers; towels & wash cloths; silver wear; bathroom set; etc.
if he's married then yes, duh
He never had sex with her?
if you have to get proof then get through your doctor or something.
it does not attract girls.you gotta change that be serious but not too serious.
I don't know anyone who did it wright the first time
Oh...and if you make Jesus the core of your marriage, everything else is even better!
I can't even visit her or nothin and she lives right upstairs!
There's probably where I went wrong?
There aren't many good men out there, so be careful!
trust me it happen to me befor k and i feel all better to.
I dont see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
Ask him what the deal is girl.
why do u ask this question?
Hey Chillin...I agree wid Superman, give him your vote!
No baby it just happen that what i think
But I can't help but wonder about hers.
ask ?s, find out, depending on the answer dump him than c wats up.
Oh I want a girlfriend but only a hot one.
Girl says to guy, I am pregnant.
2 days ago, he came back!
IF YOU THINK LIFE IS SO DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW, MAKE THE WRONG  CHOICE AND IT WILL ONLY GET WORST.
YES...WHEN FOR A WHILE I COULDN'T STAND TO HAVE SEX WITH MY B/F?
If you have to ask..........your are probably too young to be trying.
But i personally dont like them
If you are not hot, are you nice?
keep waiting ur friends will find you one or he/she will come to you,.
i think it is bad because they are your friends but that doesnt make it less sad.
Slap him around a little bit.
with this type of arrangement .
And I can honestly say now that I'm glad I never got the guy!
I'm just curious....how big is the average male 'part' ????
the stork receives your email, and it'll be visiting ya along with a lil' brotha/sista
is there any sign that he like you too?
ok first make sure he knows you exist.
4 me der is no difference.its jaz it is much better to hear making luv than sex...........
If you mean see as in date, not I.
i really need to know what somebody other than my close friends think.
be sure to be 'cool'(be nonchalant!)
Yes... Love & Romance is  different.
as long as that person loves u. btu who know they coild just pretend.
LOL I wonder that myself and have found that you don't find.
just call him from another phone!
Sex is safe when its only your wife!
Leave now b4 someone gets hurt doll!
and the guy i like likes my friend.
PERIOD IT DOSENT MATTER WHO IT WITH
i wanna know what they like to do only talk or something else...............
This is what she looks like: Blonde Shoulder Blade hair.
walk up to him look him stright in the eye and ask him if he flinches beware
I see your friend likes her too?
she is not of my comunity.
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO BECAUSE YOU LACK THE POWER TO LEAVE HIM!!!!
then introduce yourself then start hanging around more.
lot of mistakes r made in haste.
TELL HER THE TRUE BECAUSE THERE IS KNOW NICER WAY.
How do i find out if she does.
Its a safer way to see things instead of maybe getting your girl pregnant or worse, don't you think?
first - brain second - look
YOU HAVE TO BE BRAVE AT ANY TIME.
(waiting for you to give them cab fare)
just don't buy the cheap types, they hurt
And you better do before someone else tells her that they like her...don't waste time!!
Have you ever told anyone else this info?
that is wrong, I have gone to that stage before and you won't like it!
know ur self first...dont care about others...
take up yoga - the muscles it creates makes things more enjoyable...for you.
i cant believe that you even needed to ASK this!!!
Just love him as a friend.
i see him 1 a month i worry about him sometimes about him and other girls.
NOoooooooooo,its not weird and exactly wat the other people said.....rock ur own world dude!
go into yahoo chat click on MUSIC (hip hop)
Some women just have kind of a know these things.
Shania, becaus of her look, the figure and her mind PAM  iiihhh, only titts,
check your grammar and spelling and you may get a response :)
what is the best way to tell if he's cheating?
wait until marriage for it all  please
If you love them it's not stupid at all.
you were rong i am not any of those ages
I say this beats annal 1000 Fold.
by the way they act around you.
see if he realy cares about you.
whatever you are comfortable sharing about yourself.
becouse we can  be very mean and dumb maybe she is jealouse of somthin?
my mattress & sheets are way too comfortable.
see weve been friends for 5 years and i dont want our frindship to end this way!!!!!
one day you will appreciate him!
Complete honesty, let her scream and stuff if she needs.
I too married a guy who was in prison.
how am i supposed 2 know?
And be sure to listen; you shouldn't just be saying yeah and uh huh...
I like your message...you can send me a mail, we also could chat
sorry to hear about this ... you sound like a very nice guy.
he acts like he hates me.
OTHERS OPIONIONS OF YOUR LIFE SHOULD MEAN NOTHING TO YOU.
wait rn't u the guy who wants to ask the girl if she wants to sleep wit u??
well 2 tell u da truth it is better if u ask him.
The rest of that question...I can't even get into that.
does it realy hurt the first time?
He says he would take a girl with some meat on her over an anorexic looking girl any day.
Sorry she did that to you.
YOU SHOULD BE ASSHAMED OF YOURSELF!!
i kknow this won't be enough but just hang in there at least u r trying
I didn't let him know how much it hurt to be just friends I just let him see me.
'is it okay to have     on first date?'
first of all how old are you?
Are they kisses in the neck, massages,...?
are you having sex with him?
you are alot smarter than most people your age.
i like my eggs scrambeled for tommorrow morning babe
if it really works, try it in real life.
You should do more than just kick her @SS!
just ask her to be honest with you and ask her.
it hurts too much you devote your time to someone and then there gone.
oh yeah, find someone who believes in you.
If you wanna be some guys urge or make some one fulfill yours...
I never read it when young, but after 10 years of marriage...HOT
DON'T PRESSURE HIM INTO MARRIAGE IT'S THE WORST THING TO DO, YOU WILL REGRET IT.
soemone whos willing to give something up just for you.
Girls marry the good boy and date the bad boy.
hey there, It just so happened that I sent him a card the day before I broke it off.
I've being on the same boat so here goes.
TRY TO FORGET THE BAD THING SAND LOOK AT THE GOOD .
AbsolutLaney took the words right out of my mouth!!!
How old are you or shall I say how young?
I used to be that @$$ that would sleep with a girl and be done with her.
there's a chinese saying that if guys are not bad women wont lyk them...
i think you should just go out with me
How about you try growing up.
is a guy unclipping and touching my         in public good?'
if u did not have sex at the age of 18 u are a loser.
well it looks like you've got 2 choices.
you have a life to get on with and a beautiful daughter to raise.
If the guy wants to be a virgin then no
she would be like my best friend.
Call me... and I will prove you wrong
i would justed bring it up and go from there.
it means that they want to have sex with you.
heart & trust because if they have these two they cant go wrong
If you truly love him then you shouldn't give up !
hey thats how I lost my ex wife.
Plus there are laws about that kind of thing.
if you know what made those experiences bad .
if she is self confident and feels sexy that is good.
u never know what u or they can do in different places.
you will fined this out on her eyes
ps:i have alot of friends that like big girlz
Yes, just don't buy cheap ones, made with uncomfortable material!
!stop looking and i'm sure she'll come around sooner or later.
I don't think they always cheat, perhaps you just haven't met the right person.
does she like u if she says no then ask her if ther is any single friends she has.
nORMAL RANGE IS 5 - 6 INCHES THE MATTER IS NOT OF SIZE ONLY HARDNESS IS COUNT
Second, you can get real love by chance and luck with a guy or a girl.........whichever one u want.
i want her be mine, not like property, but like for my eyes only, you know what i mean?
Kinda wat they said, if you really want to know, ask him...........or wait until he asks you.
if yall are sexually active it may not be u that he wants...it may just be the sex.
Why can't I get him out of my mind?
I THINK YOU WENT THROUGH THIS IN 5TH GRADE..IT WAS CALLED SEX EDUCATION CLASS
It depends on how much of the sandwich you've eaten!
that's easy ask her once and 4 all.
IF HE SAYS YES ASK HIM DOES HE WANT TO GO OUT SOMETIME.
you have not contacted anyone on here have you try it.
how big is the age diff.?
i go for $$$$, a grill, gotta have style, a car... and THEN looks aren't that big an issue
Not doing bad things is not enough....that is in Luke for sure, and possibly in the other 3 gospels.
my boyfriend is the perfect man too.
Enjoy and think you're helping a friend - his wife!
She will usually let you know =)
you just need to let nature take its course.
why should he gets out with ma ex in the first place... he has no right!
I dont think girl need to worry about it.
yes at first, but it gets much more fun
My bf wants me to try it.
why ask if you dont know
if u really want to n really love ,yes, u shall !
and the affair becomes an outlet where that new person gives them what there spouse doesn't anymore.
first do a people search.if he has a listed # it is public knowledge.
someone who backs u up 24/7
Either he loves you too, or its time to move on.
no way oce a cheeter always a cheeter dump his ass
yea i do belive so if you really like the person.
If she dances around the question, chances are she prefers HIM!
every1 wants sum1 dat dey can call dere own.
DO YOU FIND YOURSELF THINKING OF THIS PERSON NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE DOING?
It's pretty good for me, as a saggitarian.
Yeah i had a guy like that once.
Some like their nipples touched and some don't at all.
I guess we all react differently but I got a new career and a divorce and am lovin it!
Well now we have 2 little girls and they are beautiful & wonderful, but Now our relationship sucks!!
#1: Why did you break up in the first place?
My cousin always told me if you could suck his big toe, then you love him.
Only if I was gay....I am not.
I can't believe the monster she turned into.
bein luved by sum1 special is like seein ur dream come true.
AND REMEMBER  THAT YOU FALL IN AND OUT OF LOVE EVERYDAY WITH HIM.
1st u ask her and then love her...so simple..
Pick some really good guys in your school and act flirty.
she would have to approve the girl you are seeing .
girl if you r freaken stupid go ahead and do it but be smart and dont do it
Theres nothing wrong but to be on the safe side go see ur dr.
is it a stupid thing 4 fall 4 someone many miles awayz from you?
could be intresting for me too...
How do you even know you're gay?
don't think about what you're going to say, or what she's going to say.
BOTTOM LINE___________________             Your not happy get out    get out    get out move on     move on   move on
If so it wasn't meant to be.
Well if your care for him a lot then I would say don't let him go yet.
why don't u take care of your wife now and your unborn baby and not your dick,
first of all dont think, you must know he cheating.
Whenever I feel like I am drowning, I take a step back, take time for ME!
girls love a guy to be romantic.
Else dont and give value to u r parents words.
i was on the phone with him and he asked me if i liked him and i didn't asnwer.
you might want to start with the chubby girls first if you want a quicker response
n of course if u are not too young !
im very shy how do i break it to him?
cause u do what we say
what do u mean by here?
i think its doesn't matter tht ur best freind have best freind.
it did and me and my hubby both hesitated and grinned at ech other when we said it
want to see him before it is too late..
why should he marry you ?
yas i am here to whome u are searching for.
aint nothin wrong wit comin quick if your not tryin to prove anything
Am I gonna have to kick her @$$?
Best friend or not, that guy needs to have his butt kicked.
chop your head off while handing her the letter reading; I WOULD DIE FOR YOU youo be the judge!
GIRLFRIEND,  ITS A FACT YOU ARE IN LOVE!!
If he cares for you, he'll do just that :p
i want to know if i am in love with someone
When he sees you at your worst and still thinks you're pretty!
Maybe He has, but maybe not.
take him on a boat ride.
either for a girlfriend or for a wife
Check out the little white wedding chapel, tho...i have heard good things about it:-)
Sometimes the bad boys are just sexy!
just because your relationship sucks doesn't mean that it's hopeless.
so y would u have 2 major girlfriends?
you might as well start cheating on your man.
what is it a woman does while she kisses you that turns you on the most?
Ask her out to a dance, or to a movie or something, like friends would do.
and oh i cant stop staring at him!..
i mean people do get curious.
Hep me out bro, am worthy, I take my oath on it.
No, to lose your virginity you need to put your penis inside of her!
if yes, then just pray and try to b friends.
Don't knock it 'till you try it!
i was 12 and it was with my sisters best friend who was 15 at the time
But she hides the way she is.
18 is a great time to start.
YOU SAID HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND!
But I know this is not always true ...
Go to a party get some ice cold water dump it on him and leave!
wow is all i have to say to that, except that it is wrong.
About 2 1/2-3 inches inside the vagina on the upper side, depending on the girl...guys I do not know
honestly girl, if you have ever seen hope floats, all the hulmilation is not worth the effort.
Just tell her that you cherish her friendship and that as friends you dont want her to get confused!
nope not important...in fact, if she were i might get suspicios...kidding.
pls read Isaiah 52, preferably in the Old King James--oh Lord its powerful!!
tell him you still love him and that he is sweet
it means they want 2 fuck
If you are really in love...does it matter?
tell him that he is a jerk!
CONGRATS ITS A BEAUTIFUL THING I HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THE PAST 14 YEARS AND STILL LOVING IT!
MARRIAGE IS A BLESSING WITHOUT A DOUBT!!
yes my wife is before 24/7 3 to 4 days before she starts
Groups are so cliche and people just need to start hanging out with whoever they want to!
If your still having problems then you shouldnt have her.
my girlfriend is black and sh says dat white man r the best
you know what goes around , comes around, so think of not to cheat.
the clitoris and nipples because they are the most sensitive
Now that's something you don't hear everyday.
Fifteen is way too young to get married.
just walk over and simply say hi.
I always finish WAY too soon...it gets better...I've been with my wife for 3 and a half years!
thing of a sexy thought and i do believe your in
I'm sorry but I can't do this.
have your friend flirt and ask if he has a girlfriend and what does he think of you.
am iunattractive or do i not stand out!!!!!!!!
Why would you think men are the Idoits?
high tech stuff.. thats what i want.
Even after pills, if it still don't work, try getting her exotic pleasuring toys.
i dont think its that late.
does he feels comfortable being around u?
Not like men, who **** just to ****.
anyone out there have a mandingo?
Can someone PLEASE prove to me that this world is not full of jerks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
well i would find another guy and forget about him.
were do you live and how old are you write me back at iwalktheline247@yahoo.com thanks you seem really cool
When he randomly flirts with you and wants you to play guy sports and asks you to go steady!DUH!
For sure studs or small hoops they look sexy on guys, big earrings look ugly on guys.
my wife told me that she needed a ride home.
Well... FIRST, curvy and thin don't REALLY happen.
Well I do like larger women's.
oh and don't try to hard
moreover she told my brother she didnt like me.
Ask yourself the big question:  Who gives me butterflies?
Go up to him and say Dont lie to me I know ur dating some other girl!
becz girls think they are clever thats why boys like cheating
SHOW HER THAT YOU ARE REAL AND THAT YOU LOVE HERE AND CARE ABOUT HER AND HER BODY.
youll appreciate him more when u meet him and hell know it, in turn hell be very grateful.
I get sex once a month... maybe.
OH BY THE WAY THE TURN ON IS THAT US BIG GIRLS ARE BEAUTIFUL TOO.
she is always accusing me of cheeting or web-camming with other woman.i am not, at all.
you can love some one eny times or eny way dont wory
Or tryin to talk about hte 'other' stuff.
some of us just cant help it.
I check my e-mail a lot and I use instant messenger.
why you care who thinks bad about you?
hey ther not a need to kick a** in fact u shld feel happy.
My Crazy 8 Magic Ball says, Definitely Not
If not, at least you are friends with some one you like.
Hay, why not ask a friend to ask him if he likes you?
thats a good question one that really only you could answer.
But most of the time it is.
dat a person always has a person 4 him/her no matter wut?
Some, like maybe your sister does.
men split in thay field to 2 group : 1- see the jealous as asign of love.
which she does with the nurse.
Guys are bigger liers girls tell the biggest lies.
If not, then you will know for sure.
Your as sick as she is.
Take it nice and easy Dont push to hard.
Well its totally up to you.
u stated in ur quessie that he tried to kiss you or sumthin.
um i am confused as to why ur wife would want you to cheat!
Please check it out...you're life will change!!!!
of course yes it matters because for me longer is better, better to suck yeahh!!......uhh.uhh.
Otherwise, it always gets back to the guy and he is even more hurt.
You have to know your guy.
because of their complicated brain... they just don't think right most of the time.
most cheerleaders (no offense at all) are stuk up, tho i have met ones that arent
til death do us part .
I wouldn't worry about it so much.
but now be friends with him to see whats going on
carefully so you dont get hurt,  honestly so he knows he was asked out.
u should wait to get married or even have sex so u can really kno k
If it doesn't we might regret it
He always ask me why do i like that guy or that guy.
OR YOU COULD JUST WRITE HIM A LETTER AND HAVE SOMEONE ELSE GIVE IT TO HIM OR YOU CAN.
just be careful what you wish for, you just might get
Sorry, it just totally rubs me the wrong way!
umm tell him that you know.
it gets boring make it fun interesting.
That is why, girls always cheat on boys.
if she does, then you don't have to spend any more time thinking about her.
maybe they cant figure which is betta.
he is not in love with you he just wants someone to have on the side
Guys are soo easy to turn on.
What do people build there relationships on these days!!
i don't think there is any set amount of time that is right for everyone.
let him say i love you first.
I do not know but I do not cheat on girls...
cos ur husband is still attractive.
i totally agree with i know-pick me    This guy is a complete jerk and u probably r one too.
u do what u fell deep down inside.
MY GIRLFRIEND SAYS WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH.
A man probably doesn't have to lie to his guy friends.
is it totally bad for me to envy them?
(but i'm not 1 of them)
i heard .. apples make them good in taste
I'd have to choke a b!tch
I think with..almost everything in life..you should not be rushed.
i'll answer with a favorite quote...
You sound like a nice person.
If I ever get married again, Vegas is the way to go.
is it wrong for a woman to ask instead of the man?
Got to be careful with that one.
5- How do you intend to get to him to tell him this?
Well....*why* don't you want to have sex with him?
sometimes, just dont over do it because then it becomes annoying, but otherwise yea!
and then she gave me $20 back.
Its ok, ill go out with you  lol
dont do anything you dont want to do!
Just show her how to have a good time!!!
actually i like it when my girl acted jealous.
I kiss my husband whenever I feel Like it.
If you really love this person then marry this person.You will b very happy
just because she likes girls does not mean she wants you.
WHEN I GET IN MY BED I THINK OF SLEEP.
if he cheats on his wife he can cheat on you.
love moves and works in mysterious ways...
no means no, and waiting till you were crying was too long.
DONT LET IT BECOME A ROUTINE!!
You could read some books if he's not willing to get some counseling to help both of you.
just come out wit it when he comes over to see u
STICK WITH HIM, EVENTUALLY YOU'LL STICK AS WELL.
Anyway, I hope this doesn't sound too sick (it is your question after all) and answers your question.
And he cant always hang out with us because he lives 15 minutes away!
Not at all.....as long as the chemistry is there age is just a number.
You'll still young and you have a lot  going for you in life you know.
unless there are other reasons why u 2 should get married.
But I can't deal with lies.
you know the little boats that are in italy.
fuck the shit out of both of them, maybe even at the same time!
its ur life enjoy it with ur way.
It ruins relationships, lives, families--does he have any kids??
because men tend to make it out to be more then it really is!
find a hobbie that you's can share.
yes its cute to see them breake rules, but i mean get a life and get over it!
I don't know about me yet but,my mom's friend got married to a black guy..
So I don't know if you should go that deep.
Keep in mind I am REAALLLYY shy.
hi i can be your friend mail me at harryblehnabladder@yahoo.com names sherly
and if he doesn't like you then it shouldn't matter.
Because if your just desperate for marriage then you can get anybody.
Skinny looking things don't do it for me.
we broke up and i just want to be friends.
If you are JJ then there is no way that kaylin likes you.
depends on how old you are, but you may just be late.
my friends name is taylor and i have gon out with 2 boys whos names r jake and dalton.
You better tell that B**** to back off.sorry for the word but if you like him fight for him
yeah,but do u think at the that time he really was thinking??????????
and if he feels the same way i feel about him, is it really love?
what kind of question is this
she set me up with a nurse of hers.
He doesn't just have a girlfriend, he has a WIFE!
Some people don't believe in marriage.
THEY JUST DONT CARE NO MORE.
1.well how r u going to marry them if thier still in prison????
if he does you should talk to him.
Now you should worry if your 50 years old and never been kissed.
you are young and you have to find the right person.
cause there idoits never trust them but if there yur parents or brother sure
Once a cheater always a cheater.
the one who wasn't afraid to tell my parents where to shove it...LOL.
I hope time will run its course and I catch the sex bug again.
y is it dat nothng is as per our wishes???
If you don't love him, i don't think you'd care that much if he cheated on you.
And woundered why girls didn't like me.
Probably the same thing you want.
(his way, or the highway) When I want to, he gets all mad most of the time.
Specially when I say I love you to her.
Think of the things he'd like best!
Just wait it out, if he likes you, he is going to eventually ask you out again...
My milkshake brings all the girls to the yard, and their like, it's better than yours...
#4: Is it worth getting back and why?
And i don't think he ever will.
just give him a peck every once in a while!!
be it 6000 miles like mine, or 6 miles.
Nice guys are boring to women.
because i couldnt see that with this person, she got her citizenship and then blew town.
which my wife told me she would to make sure i was happy.
make it fun for her and you
if it takes 20 years than so be it.
It is jerks like that that give good guys a bad name.
It just stops all of a sudden!
I know you are an old fashioned guy .
It always amazes me when I see women like this.
at first they feel funny then it feels really comfortable!
I didn't change my name back after I got divorced only because I am lazy like that!
big women or small women, it shouldn't matter.
umm... i guess it can both ways!!
he looks beond the snoby cheerleader.
Well I just took my girlfriend to see Memoirs of a Geisha.
just because you have the hots for some guy doesnt mean you should start dating him.
He has a plan for you!!
my brother loves this girl, whom i have met once.
Hun if he keeps you a secret he ain't worth it in the long run.
Let him get off his lazy butt and go pick out a ring and plan ONE STINKING ROMANTIC night.
I didn't really lose what I thought I had, because it never exisisted!
don't think of something that doesn't exist.
From my experience some men (not all!)
1..hang out with your friend AND your boyfriend.
Talk about having a full plate!
#3: Do you really LOVE him?
2 weeeks shy of my 13th birthday.
what does this all mean, does it mean he likes me?
YOU PROBABLY CAN'T BUT IF YOU LIKE HIMTHEN DON'T GO OVER THE HILL WITH TI
Do something to her that you don't do to any other girl.
if it was me i think i would tell her .
you're just not sure if the other might freak out.
I think for a person to cheat on another person, they can't honestly care too much.
My hubby & I are 28.
Then its mean she LOVEs she  She loves you
you were his friend who is now with thier mom.so be carefull of what you ask for.
Why will he not let me go?
Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
u should appologize to him and tell him that u weren't serious and forgive him
Odd, if he really didn't WANT you to see the text message.
18, my first semester of college
You can't keep stuff like that bottled in.
Use them as if they were trash?
2 years, what a waste of time!
I do not believe in romance without legal marriage, even she also like to have a home.
I WAS 22 WHEN  WE MET.
patience and chastity....  i suspect that you gave him your heart and your body long ago.
Ask him what he's staring at
NEVER I REPEAT NEVER USE THE L WORD
( if he knew how upset the initial blow was, he'd never talk!)
He is waiting until he gets married!
Why don't you just call him?
If he cheats once...he will do it again.
and who couldnt use another good friend.
mmm...sorry you need to be their for your wife and baby.
No not unless you both want to
Is he a little playa playa?
you to make yourself comfortable around him.
Im not a guy but one time I did cry b/c it was my first multiple orgasm doggystyle.
its good to smile shows ur confidence.
Why he can't get none from his girl...  u think it sex..... then ask him.
do you really want to break up with your fiance?
from there is where you should start trying new things to try and get you in the mood again.
Becuase of the guys you pick, not all guys are like that.
Talk to his friends, get them to help him find you ;)
don't try to convince yourself that its a bad idea.
just tell he/she that they are are annoying or if he/she starts getting annoying just tell him/her to chill
-^.^- ... it's the best way!
You could always become a porn star... Lol.
God CARES about each one of us, HE MADE YOU!!
6 inch gage is sexy on a sexy guy
If he has a girl then move along.
No I do not have a boyfriend, but however I do have a wife....lol

Try to find a good lookin guy with a big women, wont happen.
cause ur stalkin or sweatin dem or just annoying.mayb
Yeah I think u should but just as close friends at first.
How about little love notes around the house?....maybe with his shaving kit?
he is loving you too right?
EVEN IF ITS FOR SELFISH REASONS TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,YOU SHOULD NOT HOLD ON TO A GRUDGE.
that usually means you asked the wrong guy.
aw do not listen to those two.
you have to stop loving him
yes.to my little cousin.but not to some1 special
tell them its over i dont want you your a dickhead
give every guy a chance...Im me at meow3994@yahoo.com  4 more info.
I sat with her the the first day I saw her.
Get to know each other and hang out.
Sex....to women it means commitment....one nighters...are a slap in the face, basicly making her feel like a chaep whore!
If you want a hoe, find a hoe.
some guys dont kiss girls while doing it, but its the best when they are affectionate.
Like, If you could be any animal, what would it be and why?
don't get me wrong i love them, dearly, and really truely happy for them.
There are good guys out there you just haven't found the right one yet.
Then tell about the code... Never date a friend's ex.
Total slap in the face to a guy.
IT WILL AFFECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH FOR MANY OR THE REST OF YOUR YEARS.
Yea well thats what girls do!!!
she 3 years older then him
Get the hell out of there!
queen, try not to take the chat rooms so seriously.
And you can't keep it inside anymore.
By the way dont care what your friend think they're not the one sleeping with him.
I guess just be yourself & keep everything on a comfortable level!!
And maybe the both of you can work things out.
Think of what you're doing to them!!!
i am agree with the girl at the last
If u post here does that make u between the age of 12 and 17 or gay?
A breather if you could say.
I like you just as a friend
Become the best friend she ever had.
good luck n the relationship tho
he thinks we don't notice, but we do!
a friend who was the daughter of one of my dad's friends was visiting.
I don't want a divorce, but I want to be in love too.
I bealive its because they are insecure with his or herself
It's hard on me and I love him.
My kids are 5 and 3.
well has she seen da ?
dont have a friend ask him whatever you do b/c that could lead to more difficulties.
once you go thong you dont go back.
i beleive its OK for a woman to ask.
Yes, very much so for the first time!
fart on her face a few times.
nice question...my answer...go to a place where morality and insanity works hand-in-hand!
i'm in similar boat as yours,but im against divorce.
Of course there is always love...
I don't know yet, and i'm not planning to know for a little while longer :)
yes, and he never had a clue.
Maybe your girlfriend is just ugly XD
you an interogate him about anything and find out anything if he really does love you...
It will ( if they get married) make their wedding night so much more special!
Just like girls, some cheat some don't.
L=love I=is F=for E=ever If u spread love for everyone, u shall be remembered for ever.
well, if you're willing to give up sex, then we'll take it.
Why head over hills in love?
I dont like using the phone that much.
Say hi and try to get to know him a little bit.
There are girls who like class clowns.
needless to say i am devestated!
im not sure who she is... r u tammy?
i agree w/ everyone that anwered this is that it is 2 late!!!!
if ur sweet then u would get sweetness in return!!
THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD MAKE HIM SORRY FOR WHAT HE LOST....
I thought she was stupid AND ugly!
I asked this question once but maybe I need to explain myself further.
wireless gamepads, wireless headphones, u know.. its cool to go wireless now...
As much as they can get away with!!
if not, then i guess you either stare back, or simply ignore him.
you need to work on your spelling!
Dump his ass and move on you don't need to be with a jerk like that.
Get her drunk and make out with her.
And always stress that it is who she is that you care for, not what she looks like!
ok i have a boy friend and i like another guy.
If she messed up then forgive her.
He always stares at me and throw stuff at me?
I said I love you to my ex because I really love her.
I don't know what it is.
THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE HE WILL CHEAT ON YOU AGAIN....
i have been with my husband since we was 10 and 11 and we got married last year.
find out why they accuse you that.
Just say this: If you don't like me, just leave me.
trust me when i tell you he doesnt seem worth changing your future for
I am just too old of a guy to be talking with a young girl of your age.
smile, laugh, do whatever it is that you do to have fun!
i never realized how much i liked them until i wore regular panties again one day.
I've got a good friend named Hannah.
dunno about u, but if is good it makes me laugh, not cry...
i agree with all the people in here.
!..F'in two chicks at the same time is just NASTY!!!
It's crazy and fun and totally cool.
honey if he loves you enough to wait then you have a much better chance of things working out
Your married and your wife wants you to cheat and it's okay with you?
Class clowns DO NOT attract girls!
No I haven't there but the best thing is to talk to an attorney...Best of Luck............
no, it just means you are smarter than a lot of other 18 year olds who aren't.
woman are jelous of their frien true or false
well the respectful thing to do is not override your parents rules!
A marriage is a holy thing that should not be poked fun of or mocked.
i think that you should call her.
we are talking but i dont know if he likes me i need help
maybe ask her out in a few weeks.
talk to her about it, don't just ignore her!
don't look for a relationship, let it find you.
check twice  ask  a guidence counsleor at school  this is just my oppion
But if you want an answer, girls get more pleasure coz guys love to please.
Hence the old addage that women mature before men, is totally true.
Ive been there, right where you are, and it hurts!
Try the Internet (e.g., match.com, yahoo.com, ...)
all so you getting your pay back buddy.
Give then something that U love that they don't know you love.
test you person so that you can go to the next sooner than later.
Hell yeah he will... what's he doing now?
well if you think he is cheating then you souldnt stay with him.
Each block has one...pick a good one and have fun!
Size Does Matter :D   I'm Just kidding ..
all the rest will follow soon.
because of you guys thinking that they are cheap after they've done it
i don't want to leave my husband becuase i have 3 kids.
b/c they have no personality or they r jealous of u for some reason :)
feel love or deep fondness for.
i have told him my feelings but he did not answer me.
about 1-2 hours a day it depends on how much hw i have
He's not in his comfort zone, it's tuff!
because if u dnt, u'll regret it 4ever.
Hangs out with you when he has nothing to say.
U do realize, that socialist doesn't mean ur social like a socialite.
Doesn't that sound cool to say?
would u ever want anyone to do that to you?
yes im 14 and yes im straight
Doesn't anyone pbelieve in good old love?
You are still in school, so you shouldn't be getting busy with ANY of them anyway!
yea duh but when we get use to it its no stopping so yea pain is pleasure!
dont think about it that much... if you really want to know you should investigate.
keep a sun lounger at the beach for him at 6am
If you don't like it after a few trys tell your man you don't wanna it up the but.
tell dem to g et over it u luv him n dats all that matters
HE DOESN'T TELL ME HE LOVES ME ANYMORE, WE HAVE NO COMUNICATION AT ALL.
i will be taking applications at resqmedic1971@yahoo.com  ha ha ha
DON'T  WASTE YOUR TIME AND VIRGINITY.
she probably means the convo is too superficial.
I THINK ITS BETTER YOU FOR TO ASSES YOUR INTERESTS & THEN PUT MARKS IN FRONT
SIMPLY BECAUSE HAVING SEX ONLY IN THE BED CAN BECOME ROUTINE AND BORING.
no,(and if someone says yes u are gay.no offense if u are.)
I haven't told him though because Im used to guys my age (25) NOT wanting comittment.
:o) And if he really does love you, Keep Him
and of course, he asks u on a date
this is the third time to see such a question this week!!!!
She probably just wants to be happy and not lonely!
Look it up on line if you don't believe me.
No, but if you think you're that good I'm willing to have an open mind!
And also U Cant make her accept your propsal.
no , i do believe some ladies r very cute but i never could do nething w/ them
Why are u being a jerk to your friend?If she is bugging u just tell her!
but i also love the nurse lady very much.would i be selfish in getting a divorce .
Yep, like the girl above me said...an interracial relationship.
go different places dont be shy, have fun with it, flirt
you get one chance...you blew yours besides you had a rason to leave so why would you go back
BOooooooo... We dont like to cheat!
Those are gay don't think they are gay, THEY KNOW THAT.
And now my BOYFRIEND ditched me for my old friend!!!!!
just very simple, do the sex when u both need it.
if no, then just try to be friends with her.
You want tell a girl that you are in love with her!
You must be 12 yrs old!!
You are not that dumb of a girl to even put up with it.
my exhusband had a 9 inch penis but he didnt know how to pleasure a woman at all!
If yes, how should I tell her?
just say no, I dont want to have sex if you dont.
be rude and annoying until shes leaves willingly.
DOES ANYONE KNOW OF A PILL THAT CAN MAKE ME LAST LONGER??!!
his voice stumbles when you talk to him you catch him always looking at you.

If she killed him and figures out you know she could kill you.

Start flirting with the single guys u like and get to know them.
mostwantedchick13 pm me on  yahoo we can chat about it.....Beaver  ...you can pm  me too

they think there pimps there not there just stupid and have nothing better to do
Once a while, she would be nice to me and i feel like in cloud 9.
But your mind tell you tell to stop!
Tell him/her that u cant lie anymore..
go out with him n leave with someone else.
If he is too big he cannot do anything but hurt a girl.
invite your boyfriend over and ignore her
but it is something you should discuss.
Well....my husband and I just got married a little over a month ago and we have silly nicknames.
I try to play the quiet type and do all most of my flirting with looks.
I once told a girl something similar.
cool', some women can see through that!!
Would he suck your big toe?
Well thats what my f*** buddy does!
like when they say they want to hit that
dont do it think about aids
i couldnt be sure but she sounds like a nice friend.
very premature if you ask me
humm strange way of stating it aint it.
If he or she is not honest you don't want to be with them anyway.
BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS LOVE HIM.
Guys cheat on girls cuz they think thier pimps.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER FOR HER IN LIFE THAN THE LIFE SHE IS LIVING NOW!!
look in to your local laws though.
come on you know do you realy have to ask?
6 affectionate greetings (give him my love).
you can get her  a necklace or something special.
r u looking for an underage same-sex date?
U MEAN WHY DO MEN DO THAT RIGHT?
so if you want to find love you have to find friendship frist
OK, have you avtually met her or not?
Have fun.......and send me a postcard.
Tell your boyfriend you just love how that guy is dressed.
hey yall u just need 2 be coolwith it.
DON'T LOSE SUCH A BEAUTIFILL THING TO SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NOT EVEN CARE OR WANT YOU FOR LONG TERMS.
THIS QUESTION IS TOO OPEN, YOU NEED TO NARROW IT DOWN.

We guys don't have much self-control.
i would start waiting now, but your question doesn't make sense, it sounds like your already waiting...
TRy to push yourself to some guys that u like.
He said he loved me back, but recently told me that he thinks hes gay, so now what?

Just your grammer - start with the basics and work your way up from there :)
before and most def while your period is on that is when i woman is mostly horney
maybe you both ned to grow up awhile before you try going out.
statistically no, but miracles do happen.
Punch, scratch,..Do what ever it takes, Let her know that he's yo man and you aint sharin!
A WOMEN WHO JUST CAUGHT HER HUSBAND CHEATING MIGHT SEE A MARRIED MAN.
ull know when he keeps looking at u and he talks or say hi to u
I say don't let her get to you.
If shes bleeding after you finish do u think that she is enjoying herself?
and why men are always thinking about sex when they are with girl?
13 years and two kids later...
Wen u want to n you can..
it won't get better you know
and if he denies it slap him.
Most imprtantly: Be yourself and have fun!
make eye contact, once you do, that smile... see if he smiles back.
to the 1st girl above me i hope you do live in california!!!
If you have to ask your a brokeback Bit*h

He becomes a primping mirror hog!
even if they have girlfriends, they still watch and why do they hide it?
maybe get a guy to come over
If u think your parents accept that...then u can continue.

Kind of an inside joke thing.
so stick with waht you got.
Penis Size and Satisfaction (A poll for women only!)
I dnt want to think, coz its a sin .....
You deserve a guy who will do the little things, don't you?

maybe ur finger nails are scratching her.
I like this girl at work.
Men like that don't respect women.
How can i hang out with my friend without making my boyfriend jealous?
I personaly do not date white men just not my type.
Just keep in mind most girls like guys who can be fun but also serious if it is needed.
leave the room and go out.
if he does, talk to him, what the worst that can happen...
If she aint nasty, give it a go.
she has to like or at least tolerate football, ha ha ha.
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO PLEASE DO NOT NAG HER ABOUT IT IR INSULT HER!
especially when they dont want you to know the answer.
i think he's kinda cute too
ok well i just need to git some tips on flirting

Of course, I've also seen brilliant women who are stump dumb about men, so go figure!
of course it has to be a pretty girl.
Well, that other girl is YOU!
What ever you do dont be to cocky because it will slap you in the face.
Well, Hon...ya can't blame God for this one.He doesn't make anyone homosexual.
Because that is what they can get.
Um if you are cute, pretty and kind ill take ya!
No, wait until you find the ONE then marry her first!!

Either way, you guys have issues.

im kinda short on cash so try to be frugal

20 years is a heck of a big gap... You're old enough to be her grandpa almost.
Ask her whjy she wants you to cheat?
wait for him tto come to u u'll know he's the 1
if not, tips would be helpful(i do know some hot girls already).
YOU SHOULD ASK HIM IF HE LIKES YOU.
if you are communicating, you should know!!!
when  you want  to  spend  most  of your time with   this person.
im fifteen and he is sixteen he works and were in love what should we do
id love to get spanked, but not to hard, just enough to turn me on
and what i thing now is.... loving each other, i mean boys and girls, are embrasse.
Did you ever think - maybe she likes it that way?
Its like, they love cheese cake, but they only want a slice of it.
is this guy ugly cuz if he is then maybe you shld stay away from him
And then take it very slowly...protect your heart and dont think about a future with the guy.
I don't know try some pepto Bismal
Or don't do it at all.
to hav sum1 is important in life n wen dat sum1 kisses u, u feel ur complete.

why is it i can never find the right guy close to home?
IF THAT'S WHAT HE LIKES LET HIM BE.
i haven't ever had a girlfriend.
Where can you get the dish from ?
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DOING THIS WHY SHOULD IT MATTER WHAT ANYONE THINKS.
well... im not looking for sex but you can get sex through commitment and thats what im looking for.
if you feel like doing it .. then do it
The more honest you are makes it a bit easier
i think so.if you dated a girl
This is easy...just tell her you don't have feelings for her anymore.
we think that tough guys are more popular and they look alot better.
this statement is niether wrong nor right !.....
my bf is a really sweet and kind guy.
I don't see why not, you never know she might like you too!
But not as bad as losing virginity to a hooker.
so one doesn't bother to ask lovey-dovey questions.
make him happy and you'll be happy too.
just think about how his wife would feel if she found out!
Preferbally madden 06 depends on what the guy is like
or is it just not usual?
Oh boy, I don't know what to tell you to do but, good luck anyway.
If he loses interest for you being urself, then you guys weren't mean to be/
and figure out what we ant for our self first.
Isnt that enuf indication that he also likes u?
BUT EVERYTIME I SAW A WOMAN I GOT TURNED ON...IT WAS JUST A PHASE..I LIKE ALL MEATS EXCEPT FISH..LOL
What Cronides just said - Awesome answer!
Not one man and two women.
Oh, wait, what were you asking again?
it might not b so normal as u think
You don't have a FRIENDSHIP to lose with him!?!
aren't you a man... boy whats wrong with you?
guys don't really dig needy girls esp.
If he said he never had sex with his wife, believe him.
Or else he loves being around you.
Making love is having sex with someone you care about deeply.
Im so tired of men who dont act grown up.
first you have to say the word fuck not copulate
Try speaking proper english without all that stupid ghetto slang..get a job...take care of yourself..get a car....and look hot...
i prefer on the phone  because you cant get hit that way.
If u don't know what one is then you haven't had one and you will know when you have!
according to what state shes in.be freinds wait till she 18
Dating isn't really too hard ... rejection is ... but don't take it personally.
if you don't like her then tell her  it the right  thing to do ;(
stab him you are your own person
yeah u will wonder but its true.
sexiest piece of clothing on the planet lol.
So to youI must say two words.....TOUGH LOVE.
a lot of practice and a little mono.
there is nothing you can do .
so first off take a step back and think about how long you will be married to this guy.
hey you can't change someone that doesn't want to change.
if they do enough things then you wont be in love with them anymore.
just like with all men they have some that are sweet and some that are jacka**es .
It should not be a big deal to him...
It's time to walk the (married!
if he talks back and trys to flirt with you, than you know hes probably talking to other people.
Make it perfectly clear to him that they are friends, and that's it.
I guess I was kind of off that night.
Chances are she has heard it b4 too.
thats just how they are :( its a shame lol
But he is getting married this month.
Why don't women just say they like us?
but be safe watch out for the shady boys.
As time goes, She said to me It was good that she didn't ask.
it is not neccessary that he like u but always decide that what your heart says to u
and i get all mushy feeling inside everytime he calls me that.
hunnie looks like your stunk between and rock and a hard place .
A walk in the park (it is so cold, most people will stay home).
If I'm not in that place in my life, then 'NO FRIGGING WAY!!!
cause they get bored or find something even better
sure they can.. and its great if u can jus stay dat way...
first timers beware of the walls and closets they hurt.
if they look at you, they probably like you!
a woman has something called an egg.
Here's some good things for you and I hope they help.
try different positions..role play do some crazy stuff
I am totally straight just have a thing for the feel and look.
AND THE BEST ONE YET: Who's that?
My mom's birthday is coming up.
he could just be trying to give you space.
Btw im in college and im 19.
tell me why come on chop chop quick quick snell
just see if he's at all interested.
give it time and get over the guy.
is your question how do you make them arroused?
Look...You don't have to have a boyfriend yet to have fun with life.
You just seem like a jerk at that point.
yes new girlfriend 2. she's got 2 yrs.
she has to be a 7.5-9.5.  unless i REALLY like her.
your parents dont like your boyfriend well they probably have a reason.
We BOTH AGREED ON THAT SHE WOULDNT SEE or HANG OUT WITH HER FRIENDS UNTIL MARCH 1.
u never know who they really are.
i did this recently and it was THE BEST EVER!!
Hey, try not to worry about it too much.
usually at school, that's how i found my ex!!
If he does that makes things easier.
Yes, and even more if they are beautiful on top of it....
Turn them face down - Oh and pull there hair and a little smack on the bottom couldn't hurt!
what are some qualities that girls see first in guys?
if you suspect, most likely he does.
anybody can be totally hot but yet be a big loser!!
honestly id have to say and it may sound bad but let it ride out.
No matter where you go belive me u will see a sexy sexy man
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH??
sugar in gas tank or glue his dick to his stomach with super-glue
Ask him if you  can be friends.
it's not really worth it wait until you are much older that's just advice from a dad.
good luck trying to pull that off.
what you need to do is hire an att.
I say, that if you love her then there is nothing at all wrong with it.
not inless you are 21 even then dad always knows whats best
The list goes on and on...
Oh that's my cousin and her nickname is Her.
I mean u r really into him!
i like to make friend with her
First some questions for you:  1.How old are you?
Ask him....then you can move to the next guy or next level
If not it is pretty unreasonable for you to ask her not to drink.
or maybe a massage to calm her nerves then fuck the hell out of her!!
If you have to ask then you are not in love.
i am joshua, based in nigeria.
I married when I was 22 and I am happy that I did.
Thats up to you, if you want to the do it, if not don't.
(I'm one of 'em and I can say that it's fun!)
Think of yourself, don't you have any good/close friends that are girls or vice-versa ??
That just cracks me up... thanks man, I needed that.
im a great kisser says my bf haha
go to africa, be nice, be rich and buy one.
she told me how regretful she was and how much she loved and missed me?
there must be evidence if u want divorce.
And you get half of everything he has!!
then any time you think about him and start to like him again, REMEMBER THOSE THINGS.
If she has been responsible with it, I don't see why not.
i don't know what to say in this box  bye
get over it he dont love you.
laugh at his dumb jokes if hes a class clown.
but you will most likely remember this girl for the rest of your life.
excitement... fantasy.... but it's all nonsense, truth is he's bored...
if it attention ya want and hes not giving it then you need to bee getting a new man
she's still young and still has time.
what did it for me was i found the guy she waas dating and i kicked his a$$.
a place where naked women dance for ...
he met her in an internet site.
You wouldn't want him to die before your kids go off to college!!
My boyfriend just broke up with me.
And to forget about ever being with him...PERIOD!
Got it wrong...that's an understatement of the year...YOU ARE HOT 'N SPICY...MMMMM!!!
But beleive me you are young and not all guys do things like this.
just watever u do, don't brag to your friend, it always ends in ditching.
give him the time of his life
she used protection and shes tested.
try it honey, who knows she is just waitting for u..there no wrong in trying..GO FOR IT...
I like this guy, i'm going 2 call him Joe.
if u like dat person so much then dun fuckin care wat people say.
ok so I just enrolled in this new high school and im sort of shy there.
Hon, aren't you a tad young to be getting married?
Many will tell you it's no big deal...because they already gave theirs away.
I think she pretty much summed it up right there!!!
the only reason u would not have sex with her is because u would get fired???
First of all, are you a guy or girl??
look your best and go out in the world.
you might, and you might not.
then they will come to you.
what are some ways to spice up my relationship and make it irresistable
force hiim to have crazy sex and show him what you got.
IF YOU TRY TO RUSH HIM THE YOU MAY PUSH HIM AWAY SO BE CARFUL.
or do ur own detective work, or hire a detective.
Although the older ladies dont mind if u tell them that.
And my parents really didn't like that!
no one's young or old enough to be in love..but honey, you are too young to be married..believe me!
the wife unless you really have some stuff or unless she is not contesting the divorce.
hes a year older than me
not sure but it may be 18
no matter what she will ether find out or she will just see it in your eyes.
if your friend was a real friend she should understand
if nothings downloaded it's probably her realizing that fart stinks.
He seems like he's a bit disturbed...run like hell
but y r u trying to change who someone is that isnt you place to do so
And the best thing a husband expects from his wife is that she never do shopping..hahahahhha:))
plant in a plant holder that he likes...say a car or a beer can...just kidding.
Guys do it too, so its definately not limited to women!
tell him to close his eyes and describe you!
what was a really cool way you met someone special?
Ask him do he love you or that Gold Digger.Tell your neice that .
and in d end just say hope to see u again.
NO!IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR A RELATIONSHIP,THE FOUNDATION WILL SOONER OR LATER CRUMBLE AND WITTER AWAY.
no its not bad as long as its not your mom or dad
If not, you might be too young.
just be careful about the men u choose.
i was 13 and it was the wort date of my life..
You think you loved him once, why?
Just don't over do it or you might scare him away.
Or I suppose you could pay like 200rs in front of palakha :P
Except of course, if u only want to marry them to enhance your .....
Then throw him one... WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME HAVING A BOYFRIEND?
and a walk in the park.
he said we clicked so well and blah blah blah.
(I've tried telling them, but they just get pissed off at me!)
and then...how long after the first date to going out?
I used to stare at her a lot and she'd occasionally catch me (im shy).
months have gone by, if you dont want a fire to go out, you need to feed it.
but he is not there yet, he's not ready for a full commitment yet.
No matter what anybody tells u here.
I like lips on a girl.
Nope your gonna have to do some serious soul searching.
Tell her she needs to give it a few good years.
Say: I care about my boyfriend.
at all costs, avoid self-help books!
And everyone is trying to tell me what to do, and I hate it.
It seems as if all the good ones are either taken or I just can't find one.
I think we all have those days, hang in there, and don't let the bad days get you down!!
i do hope ladies with that mindset won't lose hope.
Tell him, Thank you for the concern, but DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO!
dont be afraid express to him how u really feel
do u wanna be with him, tell him their guy friends, he doesnt have control over you
look her right in the eye and tell her how you feel.
might as well just flash them a couple bucks and tell them how they can earn it!
girls kick guys in the balls to outright hurt them.
Is it in their name, or his?
how do they do it..do they do it the way we do..watch our ass leave?
so just be yourelf, have great confidence in you.
Hey, I'm a boring family guy... what did you expect?
they are the sweetest men i have ever met.
If he is cheating on you then dump him.
just flirt with her and she'll catch on
but if he does notice then say to him that the way you feel about him and pool.
Jessica Alba - i like that actress ;) But i would never cheat on the girl i love.
The thing that cares more is that ure gonna be hapy with that guy
Cuz I can see myself in them.
DUMP HIM AND DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO!
Girls can chase me al they want lol
hope it goes great for you!
God was up there smoking on tha blunt while creating them....god forgive me...
You ask her to do things that are not reasonable, then you get mad when she doesn't do them.
No way man, not at all.
( i know my mom died )
Best not to drag it out and lead her on.
Yes, don't let anyone hold you hostage like that.
And if hes a rage aholic ur in bigger trouble.
sounds like he just wants to be friends with benifits...you both want different things .
never ask here ask a real Doctor
Every person more or less doing this, don't worry.
{wit ur b~friend or ur g~friend}
b) If you got without your parents permission is illegal
seriously, what have you got to lose.
that not all girls are nice or good people
The relationship didn't work out but I loved all 4 of the ladies.
if u see a nice girl...that is a nice place....goahead and meet....good luck
Sorry, that's just the way things work out.
get over it and move on, and never cheat again stupid
man i too have a same problem plz help
Is it look like a circumsized penis?
he will come when he see u dont care him.
I'm 18 and I want to get marry right now.
if he is like me I just hate to be nagged as I walk in the door from work.
this is where shower sex comes in.
If you think that there is possibility enough to ask the signs.....GET OUT NOW!!
But, humans were not wired that way and are meant to be with one person (not many).
Don't go look for the guy.
wait until you are 16 to date.
!hug her kiss her make her feel wanted.
the sign of cheating is when your man smells like ass!
I don't care if he's a movie star!
Flirt with him and see how he reacts..
I am not a violent person I dont even spank my kids.
She doesn't look too bad and gave you xo's!
girls are like flowers treat them nice and you get it in retern
I stopped seeing her myspace (don't want to stalk her).
i like facial hair on a guy.
Ask him if he likes you.
WHAT WOMEN DON,T HAVE AND PROBABLY MEN GOT IT.
Yes I would go out with her.
I want to have sex with you.
you will live but if you love this person alot try to get your realation ship back with him/her
18 year old.... 2. works at liquor store 3. got strict grandma and gotta listen to her.
just tell her dont be scared to do it but the truth sucks

Dont ever give in to temptation.
Just keep your head up sweetie.
dont just say it unless he`s asking something of you that you know is wrong.
but, that is not what i use to decide whether i like her.

Grab it All out at once and place it somewhere else, like at another bank!
but it always comes up in the friendship once in a while...I am in love with ( her/him).
of coarse they are havent you ever seen a man looking at a victoria secrets cataloge and drooling
he can't help you if you don't give it to him.

darling u are just 16... if i were ur parents i also FORBID u to marry.
TALK TO HIM AND TELL HIM HOW U FELL BUT IM SINGLE IF U WANT A MAN 16/LOUISIANA
so what if he doesn't want to go out with you?
this happened to me a while back, and i am once again on the dating scene.
yea, its really messy down there though.
Lately, I've realized that I care for him...ALOT.
ehmmm ...first try to find a japanese girl if you can...  :DD
why is it so hard to talk to girls???
Because if its love then who cares about how old you are.
well you got to tell her that its your guy not hers.
if u wanna go out with him, go out with him.
To me people that do that have self esteem issues.
well how long did u date this girl?
Or, you start having a crush on them as well, because they actually are pretty handsome, nice, etc.
i as a woman would much rather be the one to hold the whip :)
By the way Im 21. pabsicool@yahoo.com
I'm a Lady, and Baby you better not ever forget it because i don't give second chances.
I was a vigin til I was 19 and believe it or not..some girls like that.
U can't make anybody do anything,u could only give them reasons to,then it's up to them.
Dont make it a line or nothing!!!
hope you find what your looking for.
Do what you normally do .
I don't want my friend to get repeatatly rejected!
Dude, have confidence and chicks will dig that.
do you not have anything better to do
Because many man nowadays is just playing around.
he may be cheating or you dont turn him on anymore
i, at least tries to be.
Or am I just being greedy?
You don't care enough about him.
You make me giggle...tee hee tee hee...so much cuter than that silly hamster.
if youre not happy with this person, tell him if he cant stay with you, youre through.
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME AND YOU TOGETHER?
your mom would be delightened just tell her he's courting you...
If your talking about a husband or boyfriend there is a million other ways
With me it was worse I used to like men that were married.
My suggestion: Give it a shot.
Or in other words: HELL YES!
GIRL YOU SHOULDN'T RUSH THINGS LIKE THAT.
Ten Grand could get someone killed.
hang around him but don't be too cklicky
it should not be that way.
Then an only then will you know why they stare at u so much.
well girl, you need to let her find out for her self.
Nope but I live in OKC.
I think it will be handful for me!!
dont do that he will always be near never forget him u just hav to accept hes gone
is it strange emails or text messages your finding?
what else can you do if yes?
Don't go overboard and freak her out.
If you like yourself forget what any one else says.
but i think a cute gift would be a hamster!
now y ou see my younger brother is gay and he is mad cool.
no it more like not beening trueful to your boyfriend
sorry i couldn't be more help.
Don't worry about the grrrs, they LOVE us bad boys.
especially a goatee looks so incredibly sexy on a guy.
i agree friends can become lovers, but with how many of them?
and if a girl ask just be honest about it.
Dump him and come to me
set him strait before things get serious
I mean and i think...he pulled me back from teh worst situation i had ever been through.
Women like bodies just as much as guys do.
Tell her to be more serious about it he not worth fighting over.
depends when you hookup is it for sex?
they treat chics how they wanna be treated.
How come most girls dont like guys with red hair?
I trust her 100% and i want her to know that.
depends on the guy , and his likes/dislikes.
Should I give him / us that chance?
Of course, I'm more of a butt man anyway.
You have to just tell her.
Like, Baby, I understand, I am sorry, Things will be ok...etc.
chase him or her  aur investication that's it or give love and ask
Most of us are pretty easy like that!
dump his ass, you deserve better
When a girl likes u she is usually shy, and u can see her looking at u alot.
I am not too sure what it is you are asking...
you are out of order fancying ur mates boyfriend
And he sounds like a control freak.
~Margaret Smith   Don't knock masturbation - it's sex with someone I love.
well u no guys if they could prob.
are you being an april fool.
She thinks it's fun to see if she can get them.
but i'm nervous and don't know if i should.
a baby sitter if they have kids, or a nice hotel room rental
its so much fun and besides, who just wants a plain old kiss?!?!
gross thats almost like u and ur cousin having sex if them two already did Grosss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
for example a shirt or sweat shirt
Wouldn't you want the same thing if your husband cheated on you??
and see how you feel, time will tell
But do not try to break them up, or she will not like you and he certainly will not.
We deal with men, u got to deal with us!!!
other fish in the sea.... move on he's not the only guy on earth.
Don't worry though, mine is horrible too.
And DON'T eat too much ice cream.
Ask him and save him the trouble
if sumthin good happens then i guess sumthin good happens.
this woman sounds like a homewrecking predator
I need to hide my car.
we only share 3 children and nothing else.
In my opinion I do not think it's OK to be gay.
Either one will get you in deep crap.
im in the same situation w/ more time from the brake up.
I'm like a 8.5 so i wouldn't.
you don't, he is the one making the move first
he asked me if we had any peanuts to eat.
u just avoide hem  and he well come to u
aND COULD WE PLEASE STOP WITH THIS    MEN CHEAT, .
*UPDATED*  I can't solve your problem.
be your self and if thats no good he wasnt the right man for you.
I'm a libra too... falling in love is like breathing for us ;)
This one I know, but I don't really.
ho yourself up and rock his world and he'll forget the other girl!
he keeps telling me that he loves but Im afraid that he wont wait till I go back!!
well how old or you if you still live with them then no loves not forever but family is
Read the words......'now I want you here with me from tonight until the end of time'.
I feel like I don't have a social life anymore.
I hope this helps, God bless you!
thats way better than some stupid line most women even dont like.
Why would he do this if he has nothing to hide?
I shouldn't count cus I'm a guy, AND DONT GET ME WRONG IM STRAIGHT!!!
dont do notthing just let god do his job.
Just ask him, there's no point waiting.
make it a pair to be more romantic!
hey don't jump to nothing to quick.
People really don't think all that mean stuff you think they think.
At the Judgement Day , for sure!
and just like others have said, there are others out there, and you will find someone else!
i wish i knew so when u find out please let me no
not all people like him its ok if you just be yourself!
i definately cant stand a lot of boys that like me.
Hmmm, doesn't one lead to the other?
Me personaly I think if you catch them in the act then they gotta go.
seeing he has been trying to get me to date him again???
I feel for you ... this is a really hard one.
he doesn't know what he's issing.
that is the question.......... well ask him if he means going as friends or as in a date.
Both of them, It really not depends on gender, but on each person
that's exactly why guys can't just squeeze girls' boobs because they'll sure like it.
Too Big: her love for her hubby Too Small: her tolerance of his ignorance
It sounds stupid, but it got me out of trouble once!
Have you tried to kiss her?
i think he has some qualities of a pig!
But get out there, show the women you are available and what a great guy you are!
u don't need to date too young
i did that once-it feels awesome and acomplishing
he couldnt hide that from you for that long.

you are still pretty young, give it a couple of more years.
But, I guess that can go for men too.
i dont know of a site, but that is bc i like to see it myself.
And also mention that whether she has a b/f or not that you two can still be friends!
We truly either dont hear it, or dont care.
If she wanted to date me.

IF TODAY WAS A BAD DAY, TOMORROW COULD BE THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
it doesn't make a diff unless ur a doc.
Then I did it here at 16 and him at 24 BIG  BIG  BIG mistake.
go up to the girl and tell her that she can't have him he is yours forever.
talk to his friends and let them know you are interested in him!!
if the 2 siblings are getting married and they are close, why not have a double wedding?
can you be a swinger and single, I thought swinging was purely a married couple deal.

well firstly: FIND OUT IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU!!!
The one that you can't live without.
Tell him you don't think of him that way.

Honey, who cares what all the girls think?
both are single dad, nice guy.
so stop looking just wait see what happens.
u cant give money to some one n love or ask them to care abt u .
sending fake emails can come back to haunt you...
see them both and dont promise to be exclusive to either, never lie about it, just omit
this is just not the place.
just not too much becasue most women do not like cocky men!
girls have a tendency to read into things a lot.

Not age wise but job wise.
and see what they think if the guy likes you.
WARNING: Don't tell your frineds about her.
A nice, hot cup and good conversation.
they got married for a reason but somtimes people forget.
u must work things out with ur husband first.
if he calls you or comes to your house to hang out with you then he likes you.
or find somthing he likes that you can do.
And......who wants half a person anyway, I am whole and dont want half a man or woman.
buy him a dog and tell him see you later don't come back
This days, they say that they will stay...
if you wink at her and she  smiles back
i dont think youve really had what you think youve had.
Is there a set age to where everyone 'should' be married or they'll be thought of as stupid???
put it in your bed room when you leave and he arrives.
just don't do a heart shaped candy box or stuffed bear.
give him a dose of his own medicine.
because they always want to win
* space is for special reasons too!1
In that case, shame on you!
and recently he's been looking at me alot too.
i dont know but i am having the same thing happen to me
treat them like friends you don't see very often.
means guys will asked for it most of the time and gals will like it most of the time.
I'm down with Minnie on this one
Don't worry about it, just take the necessary procautions!

Wow, this guy is sure to give his love out easily!
Don't ask me how or why but it works.
tell me what's good about ur sex.
Ever see a grown man cry?
just keep a smile on your face.
And no it does't imply sex.
you gotta ask yourself; can i compete?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE.
look her in the eye say hello, then smile see if she responds
music, movies are always a good thing.
So....why should anyone here......wery aboot haw too spall anitheenk?
If I took good care of him, then no.
try not to push too hard.
i cant tell you much but i met him in 6th grade.
Some guys like smaller girls, some like bigger ones.
I know I don't want my daughter dating and she's 15 aren't you afraid you might catch something?
You know what they say...if you never tried it, then there's nothing really you are missing!!
the men from honduras are so sweet.

a club where men hang out at to watch woman  dance and if they are good they get paid.
GOD ITS AMAZING THE POWER OF A SAMLL TAPE RECORDER WILL HAVE.

but guys go I guess several steps further.
Ofcourse there is latinos out here.
If he don't like it then that is his problem not yours.

Whatever you do tho, do it for yourself!
Even if you need to take a class or get some counseling.
I figure he'd just lie anyway.

buy him sometin like a cologne
but if it's what i think then because i can!!!!!

Managing a girl is like trying to herd cats;  it doesn't work.
not really, you can pee just fine with a small penis, too.
What is it that you want.
it is the only way to get through life.
THATS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.
so just set things straitght with him.
Be sure footed by giving him hints first if that don't work just say what on your mind.
(a lot of women said its good when guys know how to use it)
besure to ask him if he is guy 1st?
that is the problem, don't start looking, if u wait long enough the right woman will come to you.
I told you I married him!
dont let the image of a spanish man make u blind to their real intentions.

I keept moving in the fist man who said he wanted to be with me.
Yes, but they are either gay or married!
i woudl help if i ubderstood what ur asking
at least you can say you are a happy fool not a lonely wise person.
Look longingly into your man's eyes, and ask him,  Would you be mad at me if I were pregnant?
He's like 2006 years old now lol
You need to go to counseling with him.....trust me i know....i was like him
3: were both 14 and i dont think we are allowed to date yet.

LOVE & PARENT'S COME IN ONE  PACKAGE.
Lots of women these days still use their maiden names, even after they are married.
Sorry, 22 is too early to get married!!!

if yur a virgin then think it thru a little bit more.
You never write....never call...not even a Hallmark!!!!!
If YES, then, you are too shy.

how could someone be born some way that is automatically not okay?
look in your phone book for your closest alanon group.
and yeah...there's no way that i would even date someone if i knew that they did that.
The guy down at time square that calls me George and ask's for my money...yes.
yeah whtever flirting is flirting someone just thinks ur hot
you make new friends who you can trust and wont abanden you.
love would come through out ur life not money .

The next girl's dad was totally scarey and always home, and nothing ever happened.
they get the satisfaction and this manly ego that they made a girl submissive.
dont try to be someone you aint.
what is meant to be will be.
If my man pulled some mess like that, I would go straight beserk on him!
give them enough  rope and they will hang themselves.
You're not always gonna find what you're looking for.
talked i mean like you were going out and she talked the whole time!

U cant be a vegitarian on a Valentines Day
Can I get some Sexualdicease without having sex with my girl?
most definitely i woudn't want to have sex with a little dick man
Only problem is, she's 15 and I'm, well...23.
dont change to make yourself right for some other guy.
sure why not it would be fun.
2: i dont wanna just randomly walk up and say it in front of everyone.
i have a gay friend and he is so awsome!
If he needs that much impressing he shouldn't be in my bed (or me in his)
I CAN'T SEE WHY THE GIRL WOULD WANT TO FIGHT YOUR NEICE IF THE TWO HAD BROKEN UP COMPLETELY.
how can i make the girls walk to me if i'am bald man ?
when you figure out the answer to this let me know asap
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...

gAY PPL R ASWMOE I WISH I HAD A GAY FRIEND _

Good luck with that, your gonna need it!
then get somethign like that- football tickets or jersey, music DVD, membership to a fan club.
your going  to need all the help you can get.
I don't think I'll ever find a female my age like her.

Two wrongs dont make a right.
and when a real man .
When guys don't shower, red hair shows real bad.

Well, don't leave us hanging... IS he asking you out?
But remember this once you cheat on her she now has an excuse t cheat on you
But I know it's hard when there are kids involved
i dunno, im in a situation like that right NOW.
Once I dumped a girl because my friends made fun of her chin.
i have lots of guy friends, and the subject of sex never even came up.
a person gets 1 chance only.
:)  No, but for real--why don't you want your mom to know?
Now to me that seems a little drastic and all of a sudden, no?
Men are strange and you can never figure out what there thinking
Do you think my bf is cheating?
i know that if i keep hanging out with him my feels will grow for him.
Don't forget the song that went ... red roses for a blue lady.

Maybe but try not being so hard up.That helps a lot lmao
i hate having people tell me what i'm gonna do!

If you don't want to become pregnant,or contract an STD then i suggest you don't.
I wouldn't hate you because of it.
No matter how independent(or superior) that woman is, somebody had to fall for her...

Just tell him that you like him too much to be his girlfriend and that friends are better...
YOU DON'T SIT BACK AND IGNORE WHAT HE'S DOING, YOU STAND GROUNDED FOR SOME RESPECT!
Something is wrong   All I feel is distance!

Girls check out guys as much as guys check out girls.
um...well he seems like hes making a exuse well thats wat i think at least
its the best thing you have ever felt you dont want it to stop once it starts!!!!
Hey jim.. you suck in bed.
Just because one man never finds it doesn't mean that it's not out there.
Just keep an eye out, you can never be to sure...........
So try and ask about her parents first.
They are all ugly dumb b*tches.
kick over a few stones...everybody has a purpose in life ..you just gotta find what it is.
yea my b/f is a pretty decent guy
If they are cooler than your expectations, great...
Whose trailer did that happen at ?
Yeah, like he'd even care if someone as old as me thought he was a cutie!
Who cares what other pepole think?
sorry don't mean to throw your husband in a boat like that.
or u could go to some club, like a sports club?
dump him and hook up with me!
let me know what you think.
Are u sure he loves u?if not forget him.
you have to become a whole person yourself before you get serious again.
but I catch him staring at me during class.
When you scream at a troll, he wins.
cause you've just took my heart away!
If he likes pool more than you, and this makes you feel bad, dump him NOW!!!
you know parents to know  what's best for their kids!!
because they're men it's encoded into their geans at birth
hold her hand and look into her eyes to say it.....trust me it works
the fact that people hate others b/c of their sexual orientation makes them idiots.
I think it you just say things like that to girls, you may have some luck!
me and my best friend been friends since 9th grade and we are now out of school.anything is possible
yes thare just hard to find
And don't assume what people think about you.
(I don't know of any, sorry)
sure i'd love to make friends with you... just drop a line or two on my inbox!
This frustrates guys a lot, apparantly.
Like she has the lock and i have the key!!
both have to work at it.
Because we are good at it!!!
how can i learn how to understand guy there so complex
I dont know, maybe he got bored...
BUT TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID AND BE OPEN WITH HIM.
because we don't need them trained to say we're wrong.
YOU SHOULD LET HIM ASK YOU WHEN HE IS READY.
No it's not wrong at all!
take a chance all she could say is no.
If it's his only you are outta luck.
* can i buy you a drink, or do you just want the money?
I would not worry about that yet.
date other guys work on you cause your #1
love is an emotion not an attraction at tha end of tha day whos best for you
Do not let them get to you.
go for it..... you only live once
yes i do and i'm so greatful that he did
they will always remember and falling in love becomes that much harder.
i have real love in my heart.
i love my boyfriend so much.
But I don't think I have really ever been in love with someone.
answer master has it, that is just not right.
go get a rubber ball and let's get this game started!
you're a little young to be dating don't you think?
I have to ask: Why date someone at your age?
12 is far too young to be bothering with boy girl nonsense.
If you think he is cheating, he probably is...
he came around everyday, and called 24/7.
Laugh it off and say, Whoever he is, he's alucky guy.
jsut be yourself if you have a good personailty then you will have no problem getting a decent girl
In love AND war ANYTHING is possible!!
im 18, lost it when i turned 18 last march n im addicted to it.
How about you ask her for starters if she likes you or not??
time is forever and forever is where you will want to be with him right?
REMEMBER THAT JESUS WAS A VIRGIN.
BUT   HERES  SOME  GREAT  ADVISE   TO   HELP   YOU  FIND   YOUR  PURPOSE   THAT  I KNOW   WILL  HELP .
hell no, obviously you dont care or love her, why cheat???
but be sure that you love him and he is a nice person.
And stop taking walks with this gal.
I CAN IMAGINE HOW IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD TO GET OVER A SITUATION LIKE THAT..
If I can give you advice.
Just kidding... that never worked for me... Only time and another person's affections can mend a broken heart...
If you realy want to learn.. then get out there and date..
Try to make that 200 boys .. :P
Your Friend no matter what, Rachel
my guy mentioned to me beforehand that he found that embrassing.
When i threw up in class
i plan on getting my boyfriend some cologne or silk boxers.
yes that is right so just go with it
and really i'm not trying to be mean or a bu ttwhole, but really stop doin things like that!!
Flirt with her, and then ask for eMail and tell her what you think.
and im thinking about turning away from him PLZ PLZ PLZ HELP!
my boyfriend has been calling me his honey and baby for the past 6 years.
Are you just going to pass me up?
a fishing pool and a ticket to a great fishing spot
both on the net and radio .
Oh Course...and dude, Your Not Pathetic.
go to disco and you will find many of them there that like to have sex with you !
u might be allergic to latex condom or the spermacide
you can't force her to forgive you.
Just hang in there and be strong.
hes shy and ive known him fir like 3 years.
Any i over reacting or what?
Certainly not, I go out with many friends, but don't consider myself as dating many guys.
with a sexy tone.. good luck
He obviously doesn't love you if he needs to cheat.
enjoy it as often as possible
So, how do I do it if it happens again?
There are only 2 times i wanna be with you...and that's now and forever
I noticed girls do check out, just like guys.
Hmm.. What kind of things does she like?
your on the wrong site jack a**..
just give it sometime...you find her.
i have been participating in cultural interaction and now i want it in my marriage.
Hit the gym & bulk up.
Tell her that you don't want to ruin your marriage, life, family, kids, reputation...
I said No, I do not love you.
Always...which is why no matter how bad it gets, keep in mind that 'this too shall pass'!
Who says Braini girls are not pretty.
other than that maybe they just really don't feel loved.
His voice gets softer (Hey, you) when ever you two talk.
ME,I LIKE CHATTING WITH ANY GUY ON THE NET.WHAT'S YOUR EMAIL?
It's nice to think it looks don't matter, but they most certainly do.
Why you do not shut the hell up.
we have tried counseling that didn't work,because for 1 we didn't finish.
it all depends on the situation but i guess i would say honesty is always the best policy!
smile and let her talk first.
when you do find her, don't screw it up!
A little overprotective, but god, if shes already doin it at the age of 5 i will go ballistic.
But sometimes guys can be stupid and shy.
i need one too, but it wont come by sitting down , go out and have fun!
fat people make me nauseas i would never date a fat person
i have no idea...should i stop being more than a friend to her...or should i fight for her?
let him make the 1st move more romantic and your not to young to kiss
i found some lip stick in the van .
the best way to propose to your girlfriend is to ask her to marry you
finaly i gave in because i was tire of him.
i was told that someones out there for all of us.
My advice---> Do wat love makes you do!!!
i'd say when your'e ready,but i perfer 18 and up
Thin is in pick the skinny 1
give each other space keep very good comunication and there should be no rules when in bed
Ohhh, I did go out with him .
I'M A BLACK FEMALE WHO LOVES MY BLACK MAN VERY MUCH.
or sleeping with someone but having one of them not orgasm, is not considered sex just making out.
So how about you ask your own kind where to find some pussies .
Just tell him...you never know he might want you to.
I was wondering how old is her boyfriend anyway, is he the same age as you?I
It wouldn't take too long i suppose, something about 2 months or so wouldn't do bad
That means around 1 out of 4 men will actually not cheat on their woman.
or do you like some meat?
Perhaps you should be asking HER... just a thought.
But a decent guy won't mind.
Well if u r asking this question maybe u are a little to young to know the answer
because guys are pigs hot jerks and physical features are the only words in their dating rule book
Get the hell out of thee house.
if she says no then respect her reasons and don't push.
if she does, do you really want tha kind of woman in your life?
hell yeah... some of the best tricks out there.
Im not saying other races arent im just saying that From my experiances that i find them like that.
Why would he believe that of you an his best friend!
i am more interested in the relationship, and getting to know my girl
because a lot of you ladies let them.
you need to tell your friend you like her, or get over it.
not really, because if they have girlfriends, then they must have something that's attractive and obiously, u see it.
Kiss- 15 to 25 seconds(It was New Year's) The Mommy and Daddy Dance- About an hour
try to live without boy friend for some time its better if you can do
(LOL I wonder if is it possible to have sex with your clothes on?
maybe cause you are a virgin
this is what you do.show him a little hip a little thigh.
MY EXPERIENCE WAS THE MOST EYE OPENING!!!
I boy talk that means    Hey Girl I SO like you
show her you love her by doing things she likes like getting her something she really wants or likes.
of course she know, if she look at u, she like it.
how much time have u spent with her?
And no matter how I tried, to be kind.
if you are looking for just positions then get a positions book
Take your kids and get out ... NOW!
Dont let him pressure you to get married!!!
just tell her that she looks good.
Strike up a convo with him.
I have a friend who just became single and she swears by this.
I'm mean to the guys i like its a way fo saying i like you
Wow..this is one I actually know about.
a pretty long time just don't let he/she minipulate your mind.
All I am going to say is be careful what you ask for.
this one sound boring and like he doesnt really want to have fun with you.
yeah i paid for my best friend to go to camp.
it is hard and yes, you do miss the person, but we have found ways around that.
hook me up i'll give it a shot...>:)
HEY SWEETIE I AM PRUOD TO BE ONE AFTER ALL  I AM 13!!!!
I never had a relationship with this guy from past.
IT'S NOT AS IF I WOKE UP ONE MORNING & SAID OH I THINK I'LL BE A LESBIAN.
ofcourse u still love her and i cant blame you for that.
get close to his frends.... n b a gentle garl in front of him..make him c ur beauties....
the best is to be honest.
a long time...just remember that time heals all and you will be healed
you need to upfront with him...let him knw how you feel(like he's ignoring you)
love is age less .. love is immortal... its not a relation this is a tie of soul
hey...i like a girl who lives far from me!i met her at a camp...you should listen to your heart!
I'm so curios and can't wait any longer!
the trick is finding one that wants it all
anything she is cooking try to assist her in style in the kitchen
believe in youself at all times
Where can I find their website
My dad yells at me about it because my sister is not around.
i asked my boyfriend to go out with me i wasn't going to wait on him.
If you just have to have sex, then move on a leave this girl alone.
gay men as long as they have good taste.
Once you get the feeling that you can't imagine your life without him then you'll know
If I kissed a close friend I wouldn't forget it either.
better yet mail it to a wrong address!
You could never go wrong with that!
no ur avatar looks like $hit
commiment, women who are independent and women who aren't scared to put it on them
The ones I catch do, I think, anyway, it's the only way to make them be still.
Yeah we love ya and all...but we still want to hit it.
how do i get him to talk to me about his life and how he cools off?
r u listening to music rite now?
those old-fashioned wooden seats just hurt when they splinter!
(faimly guy) are you a boy or a girl?
if the girl eat to much.
Aren't we spoiling men like that.
i have always believed that when someone is gay they have the hormones from the opposite sex
no.. that would be an unnessasary lie
Be honest about it and maybe the relationship won't end if you don't want it to.
If He was love u  are Start talk her.
Do not abuse back two wrongs don't make a right.
Rub her bak or somethin you know, make it exciting
or should i break-up with him?
Eventhough you are the smallest person its the average...   1 tablespoon...
but don't go out with him, if you don't want to.
no- are you an internet stalker?
step away and just leave her alone.
I realy, honestly, think it does.
Tell him you are gonna be bored this weekend.
my girlfriend does, buy my wife does not
dear if you put god frist in all thing you find that there good in men.
it's not stupid you can learn many things from others
becuase there are plunty of girl's who will say yes.
if she just wants the attention, shell answer right then.
but first is that only in your mind or not?
you can tell after you kiss :))
depends on da guy .. but rite now i got me a gf
not until sex becomes boring think about it
the average penis is 5 to 7 inches.
But I've learned alot about myself.
that just depends on how willing you are...to be the second of the bunch.
take my advice and consider it ok
i intend to end my 'adventure' coz i'm not at 20ies anymore.
i think every guy just gets chocolates.
(this can also lead to more luvin).
Oh, and if shes changing her personality all the time, STAY AWAY!
Can't seem to get her out of my head!
its alot cleaner and looks alot nicer too.
thats gay... if she won't then shes not worth it
listen here to all of you people that dont understand.
Have you ever dated a guy because of any of these things???
Ok well you are young and you just kissed.
we don't make love as often if at all.
IF he screws up again then dump the bum.
Eg : Snow White, Cinderella and etc!
strawberries and cream regular whipped crean chocolate honey, cinammon, etc.
then it is a good sign.
he lives far away and his best friend just got hurt really badly.
pls ur question seems 2 be confusing
all guys show if they like you differently.
I pick up other girls and have 3 ways with him.
That they won't be men enough.
Walk up to him and say I like French Fries, do you?
Hey I have advice for you.
ya about 6 weeks in advance.
PAIN THAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONG...  Dude just hang on...
Why would you make YOURSELF look stupid like that?
Straight parents Gay son Lesbian daughter
Flat head for my beer, no teeth for my ****, Mute
personally i dont think its cheating.
bet thing girl dump him and don't give him any!
look for another guy next time think before u have sex.
and we should know that we are in love because its a great feeling.
me personally, i find it sweet.
mmm, hard one here, well ur only 16, why not try to find someone else?
I don't care what people say, theres always a way.
don't b the other girl in the relationship b/c if she finds out & they break up.
ex: u culd tell dem straight up     flirt     ask a friend to tell them     write a letter/send email     etc...
if the guy decide to go dutch in paying.
If it is ok for you to date, I definately think you should be brave and ask her out.
Boys tend to make fun of ya when the flirt.
I wanted her to say there’d be some day, Be crawling on my knees, to ask her back again.
that was maybe the saddest breakup ever..   honestly, there isnt a good way.
Ok, Ok, I know, not all of you are evil ice queens.
you dont have to finish everything in one sitting though.
I want me a strong strapping man!
tell that bi@#h to kick rocks.
WHEN YOU FELL, FROM HEAVEN WHAT?
I find out about a little baby girl .
( WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO  MAKING LOVE?)
TRY TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER IN THE BEST WAY POSSIABLE... 7.
who cares what ur freinds think, they're not gonna be the ones dating her!
Either he likes you or you have a booger hangin.
just hang out and observe the other person,,,you will know if they are true or not
A simple walk in the park sounds like a good thing.
At a very young age I found myself attracted to women.
It happens to the best of us  :-)
You two have 2 beautiful children god has blessed you with.
And if he still won't tell you ask him whats up.
he is not the man that turns the earth around overnite so how busy can he be?
plus theres a guy here whos bothering me.
There is no way around this bro.
THE FIRST PERSON GOT IT COVERD IM 17 TOO DONT 2
She likes playing games then she might need to know how it feels.
Then ask her is she's seeing anybody at the moment?
then later that night he tried to get the money back.
just because of the person who did it.
i dont see why this is even an issue!
have chicks as friends and make sure the booty call is hung up on quick.
go ahead make ur own rules
if u truly love each other u shouldnt but you can still flirt wit other guyz
there are a lot of things to consider here.
Some people dont even know about search!
and I guess he was playing me out .
So why use it to celebrate a permanent union??
we left that club and went to another.
the worst he could say was no.
You don't have to take it.
Male or female who can't get enough sex.
Like... -  well, you tell me first ... , and after that you have some more clues.
Just try to remember what you loved about her.
If it just doesnt work...see a sex therapist.
my age is 17 i m a pakistani
But if she tells you she likes you, she's lying.
Then I saw him watching me.
if you really like him than take the plunge.
dont just take the next girl to come along becouse your lonly.
but here lately i have wanted to be single again.
all i can say is u will know when it happens.
What does your guilt tell you?...
All girls are lesbians if you get them drunk enough.
Start hanging out in coffee houses.
When I say heavy I don't mean 5, 10 or 15 pounds overweight, I mean fat.
go and get other mister right and deserving for ur affection and will love u honestly!
things that hurt, u no what im talkin about).
just to get some random man turned on and then to part ways.
I love black men, though I never been with one.
I married a man w/ a large one, but certainly not for the size of it.
whenever you think the time is right
I need to get a life.
learning how to kiss someone is more fun in person than it would be to learn online!!
considering that, last i heard there was something like 27 million people on myspace.
THE WAY GOD LOVES US IS THE WAY YOU GIVE LOVE BACK.
when you two talk about it
im a virgin and i am proud of it
i am joshua, based in nigeria.
thanks gentlemen for your honest answers.
I gotta tell ya it ain't cool.
stick it in there and move it back and forth
or the things that couse conflict.
All u gotta do is just try to be around them more and act like you like them.
Im korean and ive never dated one.
no, and dont go back it wil only end in pain!
If she don't love you, then dump her.
Go to clubs or party  u will find ur man somewhere
Hey, maybe I'll live to be 200?
You already have one unless she does to.
Doens't work and you just waste your time.
its the only way to truly win him over!!
Tell her to use birth control
too many temptations...why do you think girls have breasts implants?
(but of course she would) But how can I trust her now?
Would you date an ugly guy even if he had a nice personality?
If he like you, then you are breaking the ice towards possible a great relationships..... A WORD OF CAUTION.........................
If you can't find clues, then get him some m and ms
the artist Van Gogh once cut off his ear and sent it to his girlfriend
it will twist up then break you down.
I wouldnt thats for sure .
lol i really am i guess...........
THERE ARE BAD APPLES IN EVERY BUNCH.
i wouldn't , but you can if you want to.
HOWEVER----i find him looking at me every now and then.
SEARCH IN INDIA 100 CORRES PEOPLE R THERE
be honest with yourself and don't let others convince you of something you don't really believe.
But I am a young, good looking guy that hasn't had a girlfriend in 4 years.
i believe when u said u still love her.
who knows, maybe he loves you back.
So 'fess up and don't do it again.
Last week she invited me to her birthday with her family, I went.
you have better be good at routing days and phone calls
And always we kiss and make it better...TOGETHER.
yes, only if i really think we would be good together
And plan on staying that way til i'm married... no problem here.
do good and good will come to you
Ask her to shave it..or at least cut it down a bit.
which could also happen if you don't tell him
so my bf was really angry and he said he needed to go cool off like usual.
well,manthan..i guess u are rejected by girls,eh?
Well if your boyfriend doest answer his phone what do you think????????
ALSO I HEAR SO MANY PEOPLE SAYING I LOVE THEM BOTH WHAT DO I DO?
it is so amazing and you can do many things inside it.
makes the sperm stronger and faster.
Show her love... lts of it and you will get that back.
i want a guy who is honest, hard working, goal driven, good looking, polite,  and well dressed.
Guys like it that way sometimes.
I rele don't know what to say but...
They love there father no matter what I what think .
But let me give you some...
i can show you that ur not.............
SPEAKING AS A LESBIAN, LET ME TELL YOU  - IT'S NOT A DECISION!!!!.
So, don't give it and you'll weed out who really cares about you.
i've liked him 4 nearly 3 yrs now!!
i don't know the carat weight but its the perfect size on my hand.
what does she like about you?
It couldn't hurt to call.... good luck!
go out there and start talking to girls
Dump her ass, get a divorce and move on with your life.
i would like to know what exactly girls want from boys?
dont let go of your relationship and the things that make it work.
i say yes, it is not ok to have a married lover.
im not sure i get ur question.
1) How do you know that she never took her clothes off?
yes by all means tell her now!
it is really hard find things you like to do im dealing with that myself go out with friends
Except most guys wont cheat for money while women will.
it would be nice if i could here from some guys out there who i can quote.
After you break up with your boyfriend you find a better one
there is no question about it once a cheater always a cheater.
if he doesn't know, its not his fault & he can't do anything about it
and if u live in north carolina around clayton itevery 3out of 4 there.
this guy said that he wanted to get married.
Have u asked yourself if you and she are both ready for getting married.
I WANT A GIRLFRIEND,A BUDDY,A COMPANION TO SHARE THINGS WITH,A LOVER, A PARTNER,AN EQUAL HALF.
wait until they grow, and tell her you like it bushier.
Either way, have fun and good luck!
And there sure feelins will come out.
lol Just be young and have fun!!
i dont really care if its when i am married or not.
2 it is falsely extreme, promising pleasure but giving bad advice
Ladies, before you start sending me hate email...
DON'T CHEAT ON EACH OTHER 6.
....pliz dont be vulgar this is seriose..
Don't do something you're gonna regret and be guilty about.
Hope you find your answer soon :)
Not a good example for the kids hon.
hmmmm.....  tell him but don't say u love him thats not a good idea.
i mean if they just wanted to make conversation we could have seriously talked about a thousand other subjects...right?
this will at least start the convo off on a funny note.
how do i ask out a girl that barely knows me?
But in general, grandpa isn't sexy.
when you  fell  your  ready don't let  noone  tell you  otherwise
And don't worry what anyone else thinks about it.
ME BEING A FEMALE MY SELF I WILL TELL WE WANT RESPECT,TRUST,LOVE,MONEY,LOVE TO COMMUNICATE,AND OF COURSE OUTGOING THATS RIGHT
but dont make it sounds like your jealous.
you'll do fine even if it's not with this girl!
Anytime after that you should just pick up hookers =)
Honey, your looking in the wrong place, and you probably like bad guys.
Lots of people at that age talk about sex, but most of them haven't done it yet.
You can like this guy, but remember one thing: men are men, and they will always be around.
but over all .. variety is the spice of life .. even women know that.
Oh wait- he does like you, but he just likes you more than using his hand.
IM STILL A VIRGIN AND WONT HAVE SEX TILL IM AFTER MY WEDDING !!!!!!!!!!
lol okay but anyway I like them!
I still am a little childish in some ways!BUT!
I didn't know that they did!
I dont no what to say or do.
... and send him a wink.
if he makes anny overly done complements about you then you know
now if you and her isnt seeking a divorce and on good terms meet her for your sexual needs.
Damn, you really need grammar lessons dude.
get a new Gf that love u n not to be calling u that
have you forgiven your ex husband?
all you need to do is wait and stop trying.
(I do not think crushes last 4 or 5 years).
Do you know what kind of music he likes?
call him and talk about it....ask whats been going on with him and why he hasnt called....
^-^oh and if u dont u cango wit my friend not me!
Still, I am what I am, and I'm really wondering if thats okay.
My BF broke up with me a while ago.
And who said that intelligent men aren't good looking?
Does he do little special things just because.......not because he was asked?
IF HE REALLY LOVES YOU, HE'LL WANT YOU WHATEVER CHOICE YOU CHOOSE...LOL.
and theni have to answer quickly,no.
all 4 of them are cute and kind.
my g/f dosent know if she loves me or not, why dose she say this?
no either they got books or looks
I figured since we are playing here & I don't really know you I could ask.
depends on the woman, some no, some yes
You can have a any relationship u want untill that u like it and you belive that it's good.
e-mail me at for more questions @ aleighkins@sbcglobal.net
If you really mean to ask than maybe you should do your homework.
I just want ONE women, period!!
If she is a part of your life why would you NOT want her there?
but it my b hrdr 4 my parant 2 read.
I deal w/ it every day.
From a 4 to a 6.5 or so.
i would dump her (if i was a guy)!
I like them as big as I can get them and the one I got right now is HUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
i can teach u for $20 an hour.
THE MANS job in my oppion.
if you dont ask her out you will never know what you are missing out on.
and they dumped her like, in a sec.
That's the best you can you do.
There are ugly girls and there are hot girls.
yes it is half half, truth/humor
find someone who is not so selfish.
if u tried all u can, maybe it wasnt meant to be
all that the text said was kiss nothing else and it was from a guy.
Can't hurt to talk to him!
Think this says it all:  Those who DO don't talk and Those who talk don't DO
find someone who is not so selfish.
if u tried all u can, maybe it wasnt meant to be
all that the text said was kiss nothing else and it was from a guy.
Can't hurt to talk to him!
Think this says it all:  Those who DO don't talk and Those who talk don't DO
I'm waiting to get married too!
They have lots of tastes and you can talk about guys with them.
you will some day trust me i have had at least 20 boyfriends this year
being unhappy is just as bad as lonly.
TRUE LOVE AND BLISS CAN CO-EXIST.
YOU SHOULD TELL HER RIGHT AWAY SO TOO LIVES DONT GET LOST.
so keep it and u will never lose
he got mad because the strippers want me more.
KEEP IN MIND NO ONE KNOWS THAT I AM GAY.
Make it romantic for both of you, not just her.
Well, first of all because sex, what most men think about MOST of the time, feels GOOD!
If you found true love youll know it and it will be hard to deny or fight
It will be the one whom u used the next day , as a whore!
They don't live your life everyday , you do.
but to be fair ask if him he could pay half and mom pays half.
Maybe she is trying to tell you something!
ladies what lines have u went for and fellas what lines have worked for u
But if you dont love him then drop him all together.
Be your self the right guy will come!
anytime you go outside the marriage its a sin duh!
most of the time it does get to know him and go for it
Well, it could mean just that.
And you need to marry someone you truly love inside and out with NO DOUBTS in your mind!
becuz guys r affraid of wat other guys think
i am a pretty girl and boys like me a lot but its this girl that like me to
CUZ WITH A FACE LIKE THAT, YOUVE GOT TO BE AN ANGEL
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH A SWALLOWING REFLEX, OR LACK OF ONE....
And if your hair looks like whats on your avatar, please please make it nice and short.
KIss THem and if it ment something then it was a great kiss!!
we want sex lots of it
um only she can answer that one.
basically, dont be afraid to go out there and get him!
theres TONS of gays a lezbos, and alot of ppl here aren't very good drivers.
I wont forgive a guy like that.
My snowcoming is coming up, & I'm not sure if girls like want flowers or something.
Thing is, I don't know why he cheated on you.
do i leave and move out do i abuse back?
just get near him and be agressive and figure out what is wrong with him.
but he nevers tells me what he does.
but if you really love her then respect her feelings and then understand them.
buy her beautiful gift give her the best hug.
Get some self esteem, dump him and move on.
check my answer for why guys cheat.
but was never given a chance.
we left and had good sex.
Look no further then your own hand my friend, LOL.
And it is too late to think about booty calls.
Good luck dude, 'cause I know that has to be a tough situation.
Yes, totally anytime that happens he might got a crush on you...
maybe just because you need to ask this question means he isn't.
dont just come out and tell him, hang out together alone, flirt, etc.
not unless you seal the deal and meet up.
they  just too dam old to have sex.
And I don't know... what WOULD the next step be?
whats up with you... how you doing?
Seems like I'm a little bit childish huh!!!
and now hes tired of it and wants to find a nother sexy girl
There are probably things she will never do with you (i.e.
i wouldnt say it straight to the face!
they might even adopt u from your parents.
yeah it's the 21st century women shouldn't be intimidated about men.
They need to be told they are loved a lot!
No....not all guys like thin women.
Is it you or you dad whos living your life?
i m foot fetish girl  love to suck and lick fem feet
Once you guys are friends move foward from there.
and mean it' he's a boy friend not husband.
ok i go on my prom this year but the problem is that i can't dance.
Well that's a pretty bad message to leave on someone elses phone and your not doing anything..
My EX did that to me.
You just have to trust your heart but you also have to think with your head.
but just try coz maybe its ur time to be happy!!!!!!
go to the cops for gods sake .. treat him and let him go to a physochologist !
she always will cheat   forget her
THONGS ARE ESIER TO PUT ON THAN REGULAR UNDERWEAR stud!
Because they make you feel soft and sexy
Beat the hell out of BOTH of them.
but i think sex is the best one.
Guys and Girls...is it possible to be addicted to porn?
wut do i do in a nice way to make him stop?
a new Cadillac  don't be cheap  come one she LOVES you
you cant if he want to cheat he will no matter what you do
but somethings are best left unspoken.
Guys dont find famine victims attractive.
If you think you are in love, you probably are.
and its not mine or my daughter.
no because they do their buisness in the street
MY NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DO I GET A TWO YEAR OLD TO STOP THROWING FITS FOR NEEDLESS THINGS?
hey don't worry....girls also get into these kind of problems in their lives.
my advice is to go with the roses!!!
if he won't drop it, then the friendship is ruined (sorry) and you will have to move on.
there's no problem falling in love with your guy best friend!
then you can toake her to her favorite place or where yall meet.
i dont think its stupid or outdated, nor do i think she is a prude.
my boyfriends family doesn't like me and he doesn't care about anything it seems.
i wanna give him another chance but i cant 4get what he does...
NAWW ITS LIKE WATCHING A MOVIE NO BIGGIE
Go and ask someone out then, don't sit on the computer waiting for Prince Charming to IM you!
Just ask her to shave her beaver.
What do I like about black men??
looks rnt everything, its ur personality that matters.
its your call wahts cheating and whats not.
Get 2 no the real her and really see if u 2 belong 2gether.
he is trying to tell you something
becuase your husband must be very narrow minded
i would prefer gay men they r really good girl!
Us guys don't like being in the frying pan much.
I dont see the reason why not.
If you don't know how are we suppose to know!!!
move on hunny there are better out there.
I my self like what I like.
Dear Katie, First thing... you have to ask yourself... do u want him back?
tell him to **** off no im just kiddin well do u still love him or not
It's a nice way of saying I want to dump you
I cant get off this site, good job to Yahoo!
should i run for the hills and not look back?
Ask her if she knows what she's doing?
great way to see how far she is willing to go.
So do what you want .
yeah, most of us guys cheat... it's just a matter of time.
Hopefully for both of you, but if she refuses then for you alone.
You don't want to be with someone you can't trust.
plus the whole sacred sex thing.
YOU WILL LIKE IT  SHE WILL ALSO.
thats when you say, i don't know, i just wanted to hold your hand
then ask for his number, then go from there.
but cant we all ask ourselfs the same question?
i think she is pretty cool to ask to go.
What is that guy breaks up on you?
How should I show a girl that I really love her?
well there should  be a divider for anyone who wants to talk about adult stuff.
a nice romatic picnic on campus
if no - drive off extra slowly like a funeral procession.)
But yes they do and it sucks...
they will like it alot better then u just walking by wit ur buds and not even noticing them.
Yes (i'm up for a promotion)
well im a female and i like boys.
unless it's just a random thing and u don't want anything serious.....
in your dirty kitchen , be sure that there is a washing machine !
i know dancers only go after big spenders after their shifts, so be cheap.
Anywhere you haven't done it before.
Or has the times changed to women only liking the hustler or rapper vibe of shallow fast cash ?????
But I realize that never was her style.
Smart women and smartass women about equally.
not all guys are players...some actually care about a womans feelings...i know mine does
usually some kissing, some feeling under clothes, clothes off, foreplay, sex
You love her she loves you or you wouldn't be married in the first place.
Get your children OUT of that house.
it could mean he wants to kiss u but usually it means keep it simple stupid
I have no clue, but i hate guys with gold teeth!
it's not easy to meet some1 tt fits u in future and he is my 5th bf.
if your a guy dating a guy... no help from me.
if you can live life withher carry on.
I HAVE NO DESIRE FOR EVEN THE SEXIEST MEN.
yes maybe they are, or their friend is =)
there's a boy at my school that does that 2 me as well.
can you imagine him/her being with somebody else?
Huh huh..they r not lesbians..they r gayz.
If your in a relationship that you don't love the other person then why stay.
4) or for something a bit more simple...make her 13 cupcakes.
(ie if she is overwieght or to skinny) I say sit down and have a chat with her.
And you say I needed to tell you something.
And once we do, we're no fun anymore!
and i dont want to hurt her feeling and our chances of dating.
because some like their 3rd leg (in between legs)
ladies know when you are being someone you'r not.
I like my guy to know things but not be a brainiac!
hey, you know, go with the flow.
this takes just a bit of planning.
You've got to figure out what you like about it...
She loves you, she loves you not... she loves you, she loves you not...
I see him flirting with all these girls, and he won't even look at me.
good luck and hang in there!
That just made you realize that you want more mature guys.
If you like her ,ask her out!
we're not hard to understand, its just that u don't pay enough attention, we give out little cues.
Geeze it doesn't get easier, does it?
Then it's not fair to you or her to stay!
And I'm thinking size does matter!
Hope you get what I mean.
dont go out with him, go for someone else.
And many other stuff so no
straight  i love my big dicks
it depens if he is nice and friendly
I think i will go crazy.
I'm straight because you know i love my dicks!!!!!!!!!
I love him and I have a son.
FAILURE,REJECTION,A FOXY FEMALE WITH A PENIS,BAD SEA FOOD,DEATH IN THE FAMILY,CASTRATION.
I also don't care too much for kissing folk with really thin lips.
I feel so bad for you....the answere to that, though, is you wait till they turn 18...or older.
please do this and read them.
Be sure that you don't look like you are going to mug her or something.
I don't have stereotypical gay speech & mannerisms.
I think leigh is evil :o
go to your cities or towns public records website
IF IT'S MEANT TO BE, IT'LL HAPPEN.
that is what girls wish all guys are diffrent if u really know him you well know
yeh I agree its cool as ice lol
it just comes go with the flow.
Man oh man, I'm just blabbering along about nuthin.
You do realize house work and a kid is beyond a full time job, right..........
i like this boi and he's my bruva's m8 wich is da downside!!
give him a hug or a handshake, depending on how well you know him.
LOVE YOUR WIFE AND UPKEEP YOUR MARRIAGE VOWS.
men are not into you unless they are in you .
Im waiting for someone i trust to lose my virgenity with !
i like guys.....lol but i am a guy
so woman please take care of your man.
Eigher way I guess, my answer would be the same.
that is the way it is.
p.s he's 5 yrs olda the me so i have to find out if he thinks age difference matta's!!!!
Well... why not flirt with them both and let them BOTH chase you a bit?
BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO GO TO IRAQ AND I NEED TO TELL HIM BUT HOW...
sometimes u no and sometime u don't.
Its all about your game man.
and most of those guys are romantics too .
If I meet and with a women I am happy and don't need anyone else.
even  though  im   stil  aminor   theres  just  some questions  ihave  running  around  in   my  head.
I know back in the day (olden times) royal families did that to keep the bloodline pure.
i am a bit shy but i am eager to make some new friends here.
try looking around your home town not on the computer
can u truely accept her for who she is, and love her even though she cant talk about herself?
Get your two kids and GO.
well it depends on thr kind of boy u want, specify please.
if it's ment to be then you will find a way yo work it out.
I imagine it would be years later...
i know it sucks to be lonely.
Because they think it don't make em sluts wen they give us lads a BJ!
If you put an honest effort into it then no not at all  you deserve better
Marriage should be about trust !
If u love someone,u'd wanna be with them.
But, I finally realized that we both needed to move on.
Have their dog pick fights with mine.
no because if he is to blind to take ur hints maybe he is just not worth ur time
I'm not real sure but some guys do !
Ask him how often he wants to have sex.
something like, if she says yes - honk their horns.
If you have not already learned it, u will.
you battle or argue on what ever he says.
I SPENT 9 YEARS WITH THE WRONG PERSON AND ALWAYS WANTED MORE.
Most girls dont look for this.
not all of them but theres a good majority who do... sickos...
i think u an indian,,,,, jennifer_mozaria@yahoo.com
Try friends fixing you up and going to church...K
I didn't cheat, she didn't cheat.
Wrong Out of all due respect to you!, I myself still want my way!
Talk to her, and be nice.
what else make him easy be friend have some time together..  best of luck
there arent many gay men waiting
my wedding ring itself has diamond baguettes (sp?)
well i think that you should try and meet other girls.
No, I do not hink do.
I told a girl I thought she was cute one time and got fired.
bottom line think with your brain not your d*#K. jeez go rub one off or something
he knows i like him so tell what to do please
this is the only place i've lived.
GREED IS ONE OF THE SEVEN SINS
If you think that is a little stupid then think again...
a wise person once told me...dont go looking for love let love come to you.
I NEVER BELIEVED THAT WAS POSSIBLE.
(it seems a bit like maternal love i guess :p )
if u were in front of me right now i would look at you but your not.
Well I am very sorry to here that...
no nothing as love at the first sight.
I mean, it's like driving a car, right?
why should you put your life on hold because of a man?
some men cant express their feelings.
bathing with girls is really a cool thing.
tackle the immediate hard ones first.
BE ATTENTIVE, & LISTEN TO HIS EVERY WORD.
don't know, mine was about 7th-8th grade
So when my number two guy acts like an ...
i know that there is lots of stuff comin from people but ignore them and listen to your self
because most girls have low self asteem and most men are pigs, therefore most girls don't trust most men.
the same goes you us :)
She already loves you, just remind her why
just little reminds that we still love one another
i think he likes u, also i like a boy too, he is so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Most of the time it will not work.
i have 2 brothers - i would know.
Pick the one you would most like to go with, and ask them if they are going.
I use to want my ex boyfriend and he was in another country and he totally blew me off.
did you ever think about that.
oh my goodness are you serious???
we do not like wambam thank you mam.
I don't know her neither Y.
a cowboy hat or cowboy boots
to tell you the truth i would want him to make the next move
girl...quit dwelling...find someone that worships the ground you walk on...dont chase after the ones that drop you without reason.
Let go of the love girl it is 1 sided,they are other men...go get em.
WHY CAN'T ANYONE ON YAHOO ANSWERS SPELL?
I AM HAPPY TO SAY I AM A VIRGIN!!!!
98 % would  now love is much different than just lust and sex...
Just go on and put it out there, confrontation is underated!
Depends....but i like it if they put emotion into it ya know?
On the other hand, if she says yes, then just don't screw up lol
The crative way i got proposed to...really romantic and easy...but UNFORGETTABLE!!!!
if you love someone, let them go.
a person that likes to have a lot of sex
U r 16 years old....is she 16 tooo ???
Not only am I myself somewaht still a kid at heart but women are also!
Hey guys i have a question.
if it's possible, let love win.
like a cd or a movie that he could watch with you mostly a scary one
Where have all the John Waynes gone???
There are a lot of jerk guys that only want sex from girls.
My advice to you is to move on and don't look back.
They came out really nice and I saved lots of money!
Did he ever have the wrong woman!
me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 3 yrs.
some men cheat because they have insucurities about themselves that they can over come.
that is disgusting and if its rape/incest the as sholes need to die!
God bless u for being concerned!
trying buying...most drunks love a financial sponsor.
.....and that she might be carrying the virus right now?
he always comes back all better, but i dont know what he does.
get him tickets of something of his intrest.
Next time you want to do something exciting, go bungie jumping.
Talk to him and tell him how much u hate when he dont answer.
He's using you, don't let him.
And that's just one online dating service!
then i wonder why should you guys get married at all because u r not sure of your love.
love isnt based on looks its based o how you feel for that person.
I hate it when this things happens...
i would be very careful of this guy not that im judgeing but sounds fishy.
his reasons are probably stupid,superficial and he would be embarassed to tell you those reasons
but if you are talking about next year no.
Make it a threesome...better yet get ur groove on and make it an octagon....WOOHOO!!!
if you're a decent respectful guy, the right girl will come along.
Bad and mean personality, you mean like Ann Coulter?
Show her that u are the boss and dont let her walk all over u,.
go out there and start meeting people!
most men will go looking for what they can not get at home somwhere else.
He really likes it and he definately feels loved.
What a question....you know what..think about this..DO DOGS NEED TO WATCH PORN TO LEARN HOW TO F.U.C.K.
i dont know what to say to you about the right one.
All guys don't just want one thing....it depends on the guy and on the girl
So AVERAGE is where its at.
she's your wife u cant just forget about the relationship.
Maybe your ex was the right one and you blew it...
I met this guy 5 months ago on my summer vacation.
I bet she isn't gonna find anyone else that's gonna be so infatuated.
it sounds good or it doesnt.
try harder and you will find the right person
girl if you wait for him you'll be waiting for a long time.
Maybe for about a week and then ask him for his myspace.
if he doesnt listen when you try to tell him, then thats a problem.
After all you two are not officially married.
Sure it is...why the heck not?
but ask yourself this...does my wife loves me?
dont do what people expect you to do.. do what you want to do
my friends me and my girlfriend think i'm doffrent and loving.
H*ll yeah I would've been mad too.
not if you dont think it is.
I do sooo much for her and all she does is complain if I forget to do anything.
Whisper sweet nothings to her - and mean it.
you can talk with me.. email me at ilove_michaelperez_forever@yahoo.com im bi.
yea i like them to :)
it scares me i dont know.
then finally see how he reacts and well make your best judgement.
well...you guys dont sound so meant to be.
Give him a gift from BJs./
i think its better if you talk to him if its bother a ot.
c is my gf and net best frnd
if hes cool with it he'll stick around and be ok with it.
well try to talk about it with your friends.
staying pure means loving urself...go girl!
Just focus on how much happier you are than them and pity them!
Well, sweety I think you are too young.
You really need to concentrate on learning how to write before you start worrying about some boi- ITS BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
but first try to fix your marraige and do not give up soon.
if the person i like askes me i tell them the truth
Girl u know what to do, go for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
just one PLLLLLLLLease don't go skinny dipping where all of us younger folks go.
Are they too long, tell her to wear a conditioner on there or something.
Love in the middle of what?
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE READY AND REMEMBER TO USE PROTECTION.
that's how i got my b/f.
im respectful and loving guy, im a romantic guy, it suxs being lonely, pleases help.
Had this philosophy in life will tell my dyin day: ONCE A CHEATER ALWAYS A CHEATER.
well, me and one of my best friend like the same guy.
I met my hubby at the pool!
i think you should cosider leaving.
beauty, cuz i dont want to be with someone smarter than me
i posted before about my friend's hot friend inviting me to her party.
you won't know unless you go look for it.
be romantic and eventually if you havnt already tell her you love her.
I know it is not always fun and at times is very hard work.
The last time I checked, the vows were I do... not I accept that from you...
First U r Confirm He is Love U or Not.
and he gets with u he will prob cheat on u!
her husband should be her greatest love..not her son.. not her father.. but only him...
your friends might make fun of u but make sure u don't let them decide for u.
you know have her say stuff like  yeah she's single ya know.
do you need answers for this???
If it's someone you know from work... STAY AWAY!!!
get a life and get a guy not a lesbo like you!
can be able to catch someone's attention
maybe is another guy rounding her, spy her, lol
That aside, you should leave him anyway!!!!
no no no, i am 19 and i am a virgin i am just waiting for the right girl.
If she liked you earlier in life, why wouldn't she like you now?
But if all he wants is sex and cig's...
14 days after her period .
It's easy to say, once a cheater, always a cheart.
and if you have a wife, do not do anything to hurt her !!
check yourself for std hurry hurry
plus he never talks about his life.
ye dere is n i am 1 ov dem
It Takes a WISE FOOL a life time to figure out he was a fool...
strat by saying hi to people try new things then my be u can meet new friend.
weather it's weekly, Bi-weekly or what ever works best.
what i'm saying is don't jump off the cliff until she does.
would like answers from both males and females
im a kid growing up and dealing with the fact that my parents split.
there's no way he'll say no.
not neccesarily i like this girl for who she is even though she is skinny thats just a bonus...
No matter how tempting it might be, don't badmouth him to them.
There are no rules to love - just follow your heart :)
Admit that, and you won't ask questions like this.
a guy said this to me,  you always look good but when your with me you look sexy
Next to her, I know no other.
You are a female, God made you to be with a man!
A little crass to throw a party, so will there be some tears??
I had a friend wait until she found the guy she was going to marry.
Most older women don't put alot of weight in all that.
some people never change no matter what they say, very few do so be careful
give her a romantic full day!
How can I tell if she still does?
Well only a s l u t  would not appreciate it.
yap it works as there always be a chance to miss one another
If things don't work out, they have lot's of other options...
brain first...plus some of the smart ones are good lookin too
does that mean he likes me or what?
DO NOT GET MARRIED TO HER JUST FOR THAT PINK THING.
some one else shes loving is around her mostly
She is his EX not his WIFE .
No but I waited until I was in love (happened just after my 24th birthday).
Now about the stuff she volenteers for and you do.
if you wonder, he wonders whether to marry you too.
There really are REAL men out there who do not act like that.
if you gotta ask then you aon't got it
telling someone you love them is something that cannot be taken lightly.
Now does his wife know about this little fling?
get over it I mean youre never going to be taller than her
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
I like to write notes..... but they do get shown to his friends so b prepared to get asked!!
IT'S NORMAL TO WONDER ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN RELATIONSHIPS, BECAUSE THE WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN IS THE ATRACTION.
like a raging forest fire, yet soft as a baby's bare butt.
TALK TO THEM MORE AND TRY TO REKINDLE THE FLAME THAT YOU ONCE HAD WITH EACH OTHER.
Signed, ugly gay white gal getting sex all the time.
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE SHOULD CHOOSE A PARTNER JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE.
they do not want to show their feeling, they think in that way they look more like hero
but there are more women then men which means more choices.
maybe they're shy around u or more of a show off.
If u don't u will most likly miss your chance                                                   ps.
Yes, I do think thats too young.
what should i do about me and him?
and it put a LOT of preassure off of me!
yes you have to pick one boyfreind ok
And make sure she has a orgams everytime :)
if u just go and face them they'll adore u!
Anyone will if you are a nice person.
Yes, um no I dont know ask her!
no way of knowing i dont guess.
But hey I got 2 points from you at least.
one thing that i find odd is, that he is married telling you these things.
try the dating on the web.
But yeah it kinda worse when its valentines day...   Look for another valentine...
They sell blow up dolls at Spencer Gifts
if he loves you he will want to be with you no matter what the cost.
I can't take back what I did.
and how you can go about meeting that need.
that would be material love and it doesn't last long so i would not take it
my boyfriend was pissed as i said in the last question i asked.
gay men because i dont want to have my men touch another womines behind or rirr!!
theres this ugly guy who likes me and i dont like him one bit!!!!!!!!
It wasn't easy, but it was worth it!!
therfore the fact that you know the word sin, makes it so.
no i am 11 and im here to awnser and ask.
dont jump in frist one that looks at you .you find him .hope it helps.
I know it's scary but you soon get use to it.
no...you stop if you want to stop!
And if it's both then you are probably bi - problem solved.
so u had sex with him???
No, what really matters is, how mature a person is I think!
I already asked this question once and it had some really great answers!
U CAN JUST DEAL WITH IT
Yeh it's normal but if i were u, i'd leave it.
I love singing that song around my wife to tease her.
Back away from the boy- he will only lead you to trouble!
If you do, am goig to get you laid real quick baby!!!
I dont even like readers digest.
GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND GO LOOK FOR BOYS IN YOUR CITY,STATE.......... .
do you know i exist or love me?
of course a guy can be honest, different and loving
yeah it is hard to hear but i dont think you should carry on.
just find another guy for you im sure theres someone waiting for you dont let your friendship broken
Look other guy ... so many guys!
of course there is sometimes right where u wouldn't expect
its not something you should have to think about.
i think it's just about equal.
(this is of course a good time to really ask her).
but if i dont find a connection i'd date
what hav u got to lose anyway.
A woman who is addicted to sex.
if so email me at ocluver112@yahoo.com so that we can talk!
who knows men can be such babies!
Where or when (ie: at what point)?
Ok here Goes Since your a Female:  1.
And then ther are guys aged 21 married 40 years old female.
u just got to be a little faster.
sure as long as u r a male  im 14 email me anytime
i'll just embaress myself and otha ppl mite find out!!
Yeah, I'd say move on, because otherwise he's wasting your time!
yes...will I ever find all the matches to my socks?
you must trust each other 100% there is no 99.9% it wont work.
TELL YOUR FRIEND YOU'RE MOVING IN, and that he should back off a little with specifics to her..
I've never cheated on a girl.
look if she anit given it up and you dont want to wait fine.
Dear dont ruin ur life ..
(That is if you still want it)
Go to school, travel, date, have fun.
I was married, I had the chance, no string attached,more than once, and I didn't.
kep all options open and dont narrow it to one race
but make ssure mom is willing work with that .
I don't understand what you are trying to ask..Thx
i am currently in a similar situation plus their was infidelity on my husbands part.
yes you will if u and your husband settle down, in a proper way.
think of her favourite things to do and her favourite food.
if is not working out why beat a death horse go for it
everthing had to come to an end and a girl will eventually come up.
Just go out there and be yourself!
24 / 1.66 = 14.4, so you are 1.66 times older than a 14-year old.
Don't let them get you down.
just notice girls around u and talk to them.
I had a friend who had that happen to her sister.
there really is no way to justify incest.
cuz it is fun fun fun!
you cant stay because of your kids, not with a man like that.
You can hace a 2 inch penis and if its worked right it can feel good!
if he only acts like that around you, of corse!
i lost my virginity at 17. it just gets weird when your a 40-year-old virgin living in mommy's basement.
Yes, cocky and funny works for women, too ... be confident
just because you think about them it does not means you love it could just be lust
make it worth it to her.
think about what is best for your child and if you want that kind of influence in their life.
SOme one like that is no good to your kids hon.
Or are there guys out there that want the samr thing?
u love someone and yet you dont know why do you like her,,, ryt?
and yet they keep going on?
U know it all depends on the individual, how u feel ie.
If he loves you he won't do it again.
go to askmen.com...you will find everything you need to know(the hands-on experience is up to you)
Do yourself a favor and WAIT!!!!!
if she says yes then go for it but use protection.
Because men aren't wired that way...women are.
no but most are  No one can ever really replace your mother
Well I'm sure if you flirt with her and things of that nature.
we aren't.. just clean your ears out and listen, for once!
I'd go for an IPOD or MPIO
so no try to have self control unless your marriage is over.
Play it the right way, and trust me, it works.
i dont want my first time to be with some girl i dont even like.
well it depends what kinda of girl.
THIS IS A TELL TALE SIGN THAT YOU ARE NOT REALLY IN LOVE.
tell him you like him, he won't feel shy no longer!
No if the one you involved doesn't mind you sleep with other people
wat do guys want from us, do u just want a girlfriend or for other reasons...
I think you know what I mean.
6 months is not that long.
have u lived with her for over 2to3yrs?
and now because you are not satisfied it bothers you.
SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS WITH FRIENDS AND FIRST HAND...RUN...
Might even be nice if she decided it was a 50/50 kinda thing.
So what was it for you that made the sparks fly and you know LOVE had slapped you?
Good luck and keep your head up.
OK that means just try it.
girls gotta do what they gotta do.
it will not work like that.
No it is not related at all LOL
love may be staring you in the face and you not even know it.
but it just depends how devoted and what the husbands wants her devoted to.
A note on younger users use of English: f u can read this thn u _stand.
Is it wrong to date her?
Sometimes you just have to take a chance and let fate run its course.
go close to girl and ask same question to her.
first find out if she's gay.
there were also 2 guys sitting on either side of me buying my drinks.
you should say no, thanks honey.
i'm already in my mid 20's currently working  accdg.
i am not intrested in you i like beautifull girls.
3/4 ct, white gold solitare setting
Probably because you're not growing together!
im 18 and still a virgin.
Whatever you do, make sure you both have fun, and that *she* is the one thinking about sex/love/romance/whatever.
take him to court and make him pay money
For all those virgins in the world,  SAY IT LOUD, SAY IT PROUD!
we were both raised totally diff.
Wait, that's what I do...at 30!
my question to you is, where are you looking ?!
u can do the fon thing but y get so caught up when yall not n the same state?
No none they are all jerks I thought I found one and then realized he is like the rest!
and tell his u can't live without Him.
Attractive/Popular guys only like skinny girls.
Well, yes you are wrong for getting mad.
however if they don't it might mean the friendship will never be the same anymore.
Yeah, it does suck to be lonely but you are only 6 months out.
A favorite CD, or a T-shirt.
most girls think that bigger is better, but they are only saying that.
Share your faith with others and don't care what they think about you.
i don't suppose there's a right or wrong age.
And duh, power is sexy too.
we are not lesbians we r just bisexual but we like each other alot!we been together for 4 months!
Because they're supposed to be taboo, hands off!
Add it up & see if you come up with the same answer ok!!!!
of course-i wish the guy who liked me would ask me out
but do all guys like only the gurls who r skinny?
how about meet some boys for a change.
what makes youask that kind of q?
the man is imagining her nude.
Some never do and just have to start fresh with someone else or never ever remarry.
I have a tendency want guys that I can't have and it's driving me crazy!
Never forget to tell her  I love you!
(there is no defense in all kind of divorce even if he refuse to sign).
Really popular guys don't HAVE to get to know your personality...
its a good thing i mean if u like someone the color of there skin shouldnt matter at all
don't worry bout the feeling or else u won't enjoy the relationship.
yOU WOULD SURE KNOW IF YOU HAD IT ON BACKWARDS OR UPSIDE DOWN.I GUESS
once they are all gone .......... hello to the end of the world.
I Totally Respect You For That.
its foolish and usually extrovgant passion, or maybe love or puppy love...temporary love of an adolescent.
I NEVER ONCE CHOSE TO BE A LESBIAN.
is it weird that i want to talk on the phone now that we are in diff states?
maybe but I wouldnt take that chance and dont talk because he most likly wont talk about it
I want to know what it is that is so great that they want you so bad?
but it is a thing of the past .
If he throws you around...literally....then get rid of him period.
Ask yourself again - is it worthy?
If she cannot respect you enough not to do that then do not hang out with her anymore..
Somebody who has your back when your down.
- If not maybe he needs some kind of 'release'!)
Some people think feet sexy, others hair.
Test him if he really loves you too.
i feel just the same guy !!!
Okay -  It is sad that some people miss out on the LOVE.
You ask her for here phone #.
she cares about and mantains husband, work, kids, household, money, and everything else that life hands you.
just be freinds with both of them make sure that girl you like knows your alive.
maybe then you will have more fun.
there are alot of dating sites out there.. try myspace maybe you can find someone close to you there...
yes, and it ruined 5 years of my life.
you'll know when you find it.
)40 to 50 we spend trying to re-live our youth.
But life is not like that.
so always feel the most attractive one is your life partner.
trust me god will take care of it all.
Move on and don't look back.
whatever, lol) to reproduce and it's not just about sex.
If he is pessuring u into it though get out of there!
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO DIDNT JUDGE ME FOR HAVING A FIANCE IN JAIL.
Essentially you are a fall back...
I always wondered what made them that way?
if you don't know you shouldn't be doing it
but if you still like him and you don't hate his guts.
if he's worth it... he'll ask you out.
Make your life as good as you can without him & then add him, NOT ALL THE TIME!!
YES NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT........ITS A SIN!!!
Good luck and cudos for trying to better yourself!
we feel glad, sad, restless and all those stuff.
He's not the one for you if he don't respect you!
a perfume.. so dat u can come close to him always
My friends liked the same guy and they didn't fight or anything!
i remember i read somewhere that chocolates usually mean you are only in the relationship for a short time!
Now I'm addicted to yahoo answers.
you asking if it is ia sin means you are a christian.
straight and im proud to say it
do thing together and making love..   one of the reason a person cheat ..
most yes, but some men(like myself) actually likes a relationship.
either you have some thing stuck on your face from breakfast  or you are totally hot
men & women have needs..different needs and get satisfied in one way or another.
I told her that my friend and I are like brother and sister.
Did your buddies put you up to this???
present him with this list.. your (future) marriage can't work if you feel that you are being disrespected...
Just do it, like a band-aid--right off.
I don't care what anyone else thinks, I have just made a decision for me where I am.
im still trying to figure that 1 out myself!
then do it, if you waant to, just be careful.
so if you like someone take a chance and get to know them, talk, have fun.
IS THIS A JOKE OR SOMETHIN'!
yes but are you just what you described.
hey baby, i lost my phone number can i have yours?
Anyway, gay guys are so much fun.
BUT NO MATTER WHAT YOU SHOULD NEVER LEAVE YOUR CHILREN!
Then go find someone who will be GOOD to you!
YOU USE IT AS A WEPONE AGAINST HIM AND HE RUNS TO SOMEONE ELSE FOR SHELTER.
you obviously arent that cool if you seriously have to think about it
very risky unless you want to go halfs on a kid
People you just talk to to talk are aquaintinces!
Hope your ma doesn't find out!
You know the underline stuff that she says but doesn't really say.
you report her to the the police, come on son
i am having some serious issues with my fiace.
a strippers club or the gay man association for losers
ok you knew she had already been with someone before you.
You grow to love someone you lusted after
so plz ppl answer my question
Ater that well who knows...Im just 35.
UNMM be like i LOVE yOU PLEase Go OUT wiTH ME VOTE ME aS beSt Answer.
It's not fair but it is a chance that you would be taking.
(i mean i am a guy who likes women).
tell me solution to i  get my love ?
and is this a serious question???????????
i mean they all at one point of their lives cheat on ther galfriends/wives?
Please don't choose to be Gay!
secondly, this doesn't do much for people who would rather not believe in the 'seven year itch'.
Treat it like a death of a friend.
hmmm.....  1) have A LOT of friends?
Choose the girl that is the most fun to be with and don't worry about the looks.
IM STILL NOT SURE BUT IT WASNT HIM.
If he doesn't realize what a great catch you are, it's his ****ing problem... Slam the door on him...
Nothing is wrong with being friends with other girls!
DON'T KNOW!BUT I DO KNOW THIS......IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS GAY THEY CHOOSE TO BE THEY'RE NOT BORN THAT WAY!
I believe that it would not be embarrassing if you will just hug him and say nothing...
you say that love/friendship would be a much needed addition--just don't jump after this guy right away.
tell him JUST Friends and keep it just friends
(like still living with you PARENTS!
if  you  have  an   answer  send  me  a  message.
As a man, I'll tell you this...give the ring back!!!
to me that says alot about her personality period .
It is great that you found somebody to care about!
If you like it and it won't bring back bad memories keep it.
when you are having crazy sex getting bit is good keep it up
I'M NOT OVERLY PROTECTIVE, JEALOUS, ETC...
*sigh* Of course i said yes and well...the rest is definately personal!!
So i make that I keep my mouth shut.
But that's pretty drastic at this point.
BECAUSE U TOUCH YOUR SELF AT NIGHT
welcome to the club......I got jackets
It is wrong to have sex with them!
hes still shy to talk to about these things
Females - hardly worth the time it takes to blow a load.
yes cause it will come back and bite you in the ass!
It worked for me - my neighbor wants me (2 diffenret neoghbors, 2 different times!)
If so, then you truly love her.
watch movies with sex in it to get experience
i heard it was because we(black men) have the best candy shop(third leg[between the legs])
if he stares at you that probably means he thinks you look beautiful.
there is no way its b/c they were born that way!
i started to read a couple of pages, it seems funny but kinda sad.
it would be a big help if you did!
He's probably with my baby mama!
of course it has to be the right time...place...etc.
If you like her - go ahead!
Guys should know not to mess w/ my girl.
The men who cheat are dirtbags!!!!!!!!!
meaning going against your religion and teachings.
oh and your vows said for better or worse.
why do you care anyway !
is it wrong that we did that w/the age diff?
should i wait for something between her and her boyfriend to go wrong...or should i try to move on?
if he acts different around you, maybe gets shy or gets more outgoing.
do we really get over relationships , especially of that length!
try moving to japan...maybe there are some decent guys there
i know how you feel   and i dont know either
I really just think that it is a guy thing.
infact ive dated most of the asian races except korean.
do whatever he likes but not to the extent u put your self down.
What I don't like is a stiff kisser.
honey everybody judges whether it's good or bad.
A friend who will love you no matter what and always be there for you.
love is blind so goes the old adage.
plus he always stares at me.
Well, thats the rumor any way.
no she is a big fat skank
WHY wait for him to call you...
women are asking the smae thing about men...
just think of this... the only thing you know is what you have been around.
AND WHEN I SEE A BLACK MAN WITH A WHITE WOMAN, I ASSUME THAT'S HIS PREFERENCE, AND HE'S HAPPY.
be mad back he's being a fool remind him of what youve got y wud he jeaprodise that
i guess,the wrong love at the wrong time,,,,,,,,'so sorry!!
he's just not that in to you
good question i would ask the source another words ask him straight up
I dont think he should yell at me because of her.
Both you can't just have one over there other.
There are loads of good guys out there.
but i think its thier skintone and offcourse a old school of thought that they have large penis.
fooling around with any body but guys just doesnt seem right for me
look here grl.everyone has they're own opinion.u never kno.but they r sometimes nice.srry i couldnt help
thats one way join any sports or interest he has.
i dont believe in breast feeding anymore because of alot of reasons , but most importantly this one !
i want to kno how he feels about me!
), do things together that she enjoys.
also, black men suppoedly have bigger ding-dongs.
dreams are the window to your subconscience.
ask her out and tell your friend to chill on the flirting when you going with her.
And that ain't cool at all!
I really like this guy and we always catch each other looking at each other what can i do?
You are friends and then you become lovers.
i bet she´ll go nutz for you and willing to have you on bed all night long.
'not desperate' but basically anything the girl could think of...ANYTHING!
So should i IM him, or would that be kinda stalkerish?
i guess just dont judge people 2 much
Vanilla, SWEAT wooo hoo...natural body odors.
There is something called too BIG!!
whatever the reason, please don't get married for the wrong reason.
I waited for marriage and never regreted!
i was seeing a guy and went to the strip club with him.
This makes her the Jealous type and what man wants that???
Whats that you wanna do in your life?
You know always wanting a bad boy with bad toys.
so dont let thsi chance pass u by.
r u perverted or some kinda stalker?
of course if u don't kiss sometime they will find some1 that will
And NEVER, NEVER just sit back and stare!
SINCE MAN IS CREATED IN GODS IMAGE WOULDNT IT MAKE SINCE TO HAVE THAT SAME KIND OF LOVE
no it would ruin the relationship
have you told her you love her?
Dont tell them u straight up like them.
i wouldnt becacuse i wouldnt want them to think i like them if i didnt
if your talkin about ppl judging you.
spanish: te quiero french: je vous aime
i think some ppl are born that way & some choose to be that way.
Maybe your just over thinking something!!
Meet Me At Millers Grove Tonite
Women and men are not that different.
they don't  know how to.trust me i know
there's basically no one 'right' for you...  just wait and that person 'perfect' for you will come along...  :)
needless to say can always make fun of them.
good guys are hard to come by if you're not looking at the right places.
i don't now......but i now something......you're SICK.............VERY SICK......
:)  Good luck my friend, Cheers!
i dont want to see it , i think its nasty .
:P  Been that way ever since.
you need to first of all not be jealous.
You shouldnt have to do anything!!
it keeps you from having to care for her!!!
You're not supposed to kiss and tell are you?
Just wanting to get others ideas on what's sexy!
you ask yourself your own question
but whatever u do don't tell him u love him...  like not love....
Dude u don't need to deal with any womens crazy expectations.
yes you can only save her and her kid from complications in the future by awareness
Tell him again and if he says are you crazy again.
I don't know!...I just want the points...lol
But I even know adults who do it.
With love ... you NEVER really know.
lots of ways depends on the person
6 months ago she 'made-out' with an old friend of hers who lives (with his wife) in another state.
This guy i my friend by the way.
because most of the time .
i have yet at 29 to find him but i still have hope that hes out there.
not sure how acurate that is but...
i had a boyfriend and a girl i thought was my friend stole him*this happend last year*
see you sound like a pig
I am pretty sure he is young dumb and full of ...you get the idea.
but it wasn't a date .
if u dnt u'll rgret it
will he could go any where and be happy .
but if you have to do it atleast let them be 4th cousins.
I don't like porno grphic movie but in the middle of decent movies, i find sometimes sex.
just behave people like the way u like.
i was to through i faked an emergency and got away.
Is she not ......... with you anymore?
and no, i don't want to date you.
The moment you even thought about this question you were out the door!
I knwo some one who remarriend with his ex after 15 years :)
And once she found that out she asked if she could come along.
he just does it becuase he loves me and is afraid to lose me.
i know exactly what you mean.
it is cheating if you beleive in what you said in  christian marriage vows.
This is a tough one, if you really like him that much,.... go for it !
probably coat each noodle with breadcrumbs and fry or fry until moisture dries
Hope i helped you a little bit                          -Aaron G              todaystomorrow2004@yahoo.com
it lasts for ever :) it is as good that it hurts a bit.
i think u chould talk to him
I'm just crying whenever I need to do so.
fat... she should be really nice and have lots of $$$$$$$$.
im 17 @ my bpyfriend is 19 and he wants to have sex.what should i do?
does she flirt with you, hang around you, smile at you?
did you just find that out?
try to be his friend on myspace.
first of all, use the spell check.
anyway, mine was when i was about 16.  cheers.
when he tries to make excuses on talking to you....and get close to you
Most guys don't really hear a single word a lady says until they see her naked .
big balls hurt more when you get kicked in the groin.
THAT DEPENDS ON HOW THE 2 OF YOU CAN HADDLE IT.
should i carry on with the relationship?
This guy for one prefers girls who have some meat on them
what do you have to lose anyway, it just means shes not the one.
this definitely will solve your problem
she really knows the true... or ...
cuz guys are so used to frontin and tryin to fit the mold
I guess not...  Have you tried marriage counciling?
jr,  Dude, that's always the tough part, isn't it?
A love jones is when you can't stop thinking about someone...no matter how hard you try.
Watch SOUL TRAIN, MTV, rent some dancing videos.
but for now just tell urself that he won't and if u have any doubt ask him.
well, a lot depends on how old you are, how long you've know him, etc.
Be wise, think what you wanna do.
and if he approaches you afterwards, then you know its a hit.
leave your fly unzipped and dont wear underwear.
i dont have a problem with it, you dont date someone based on their race.
don't waste your life on fantasy.
cause there arent many out there
But he is getting married this month.
Then break up and get on with life.
Just feel with ur own heart.
Of course he always does this for you to make you happy, right?
Who doesn't want affection from another????
laugh at all of his jokes.
dont let her go because she is once in a blue moon.
Well thats tough...his friend is your EX right?
If all becomes weird and your girlfriend turns psycho get a restraining order
i  am  a  fe  male  so  i think  guys  would pretty  females  bcuz  just  becus
fren·sh fren: a derivative of the english word friend sh: a phoenetic word meaning quiet.
and most swingers say its not.
I have problem with this to..
the family and breeding of a family gets its roots in deep!)
Yeah if you guys really connect.
2) Why do you think this guy is the wrong guy?
Definately...Better chance of her saying yes?...lol try it and find out!
plus its your first one, there are tons of fish in the sea.
u have to ask urself, is she worth it?
Try and get out more and who knows.
I sure hope so b/c I married my soulmate!
you got all answers you need
the other person will then say,  how?
Dude, they are on the internet trying to pick someone up!!
If they make comments, like You sure are quiet then you know you were being too mouthy!
Tell them to kiss you A** and walk away
better to get it out of the way asap.
...can ...can you repeat your question please?
or the lets only please the man.
Get a better one next time around!
he never liked you, just your body.
if women can do it, why can't men?
- Respectful - And everybody pretty much likes me.
You gotta right to be mad.
no there is no way that you can have a gaurantee that he wont do it again.
take him aside and tell him how u truly feel
coz if u have Brain you are Beautiful!!
Legal or  otherwise that should not even be something to think about...cheating is wrong
you never know...she may be the one.
Just don't waste your life for things that can't make you happy.
look at my bio and history please
this is one of those situations that LIFE throws @ you, you will always ask yourself i wonder,i wonder.....?????
I am not married but I am a cheater....so I'm kinda on the fence with this one.
Make them really, really good (and semi-obvious) hints because remember, guys are really dumb about things like this.
Don't mix work w/ pleasure it equals trouble in the long run.
i dont go for all just looks, but to be honest, everyone wants an attractive female by their side
I just don't really know about the law .
if he don't like it tell him to get the f*** own.
Srry not married and savin it for then.
if it was the end of the world....   Yeah >.>
not too big, not too small!
If he is paying for porn he has a problem.
Most women hate chessy pick up lines and find it insulting when a guy says them.
They already know, or they wouldn't be wondering.
she loves you and can not live without you but who am i to say
if she does then she cant sleep with other man.
In other words don't cater to All their wants & desires.
i know it's hard trust me (bin there done that) but ull learn 2 let it go.
Just relax, have fun and enjoy yourself.
i am divorced w/3 kids he is married w/1.
how long have u know this person?
it's a nice way of saying later baby
Do you want to spend the rest of your life with this woman?
when you dont think about your self anymore and you only think about what the other person wants,likes,feels,thinks!
Love is like wine, it matures as it ages.
But after all What a woman wants is most of the time just what they end up with!!!huh!!!
Save it for later when you've lived and you won't regret it!
can anyone tell me what can i do my husband wants to kill me.
been on a few, and to congested just wanna meet others
If she is looking at you everyday.
just be your self and don't be scared of rejection.
This is not a guy problem, it's a people problem.
Oh, and kinda weird point here, but mention if you own a hoodie or not, please!
if your bf wanted to have sex you should do it i want a gf who is fun smart
my experents is u really don't know some body till u live with them.
there isn't anything wrong with you.
if you break up it will ruin your friendship.
I think it's pretty dumb they still do that.
I also dont wanna fuck up freindship.
(just kidding - dont be so serious all the time!)
if u are already friends with her, otherwise no.
If you haven't found that special man yet you will, you seem like that kind of girl!
Be nice to him...he'll probably be your boss someday.
This doesnt sound right does it????
Hey man, if you like her, you like her.
I (as a guy)don't know what you are talking about!
yup sure just give me your email
I used to be addicted to porn.
You'd have to be pretty dense not to.
guys with girlfriends (and wives) are always more appealing.
who said that yes we do understand
its the best  worth the money read it together it guarantees  a reward!!
Pick up a good magazine pal
u cant have ur cake and eat it 2.
Not sure if he's dad was like that when he was growing up.
LMAO they probably cheat cause they aren't happy or they're just dirtbags lol
Well i would suggest to ask yourself 2 questions:  1) Whom do you prefer having sex with?
as all good things that is hard to find.
ooohh... its awful...the guy is the butt of all the jokes that day.
if he still goes with his other women, then it's not your loss!
is he in a realationship right now?
i dont date hot senseless people.
he should not fall for anyone if he ment till death do u part.
bcos straight man r lyk dinosaurs...'extinct'...
liquer and sex then figure it out in the morning.
But I used to like tacos.
why does it turn you on?
You already know what to give him and i know that it is good.
wow sounds like you have a active night life here.
The biggest reason is because guys put up a front so you think they are so awesome and stuff.
because girls get worried really easy.
Limp most of the time lol
i'm not young anymore this year i'm 30 and my bf is 35.
MY HUSBAND IS ALL I WANT.
You take the L out of Lover and its OVER!
if you love someone, but you dont want to show it because of a different color, thats racist.
!i mean.... is it your life or theirs?
take a chance tell him what you fell and see what happens
it is not applicable to other couple...
u know what i mean, right?
9.He'll Tell you Stuff he wouldnt tell his closes friend.
HI,           First off all, How old are u. don't anwser that.
Women who love women are called lesbians...oh...forget it LOL
I personally would want a fairy tale orientated romance in my life :)
u have to move on and learn from ur experience.
men are afraid of losing the things they love
when such a thing happends inspite of being of the same blood...why cant u ???
I guess I was 15 or so.
Still don't understand why god made it that way.
tell me what sign are ya and i can tell ya more.
If you really like her, ask her out
i think true love is a kind of respect and care for the person u love
wat i will do, i will be extra sweet and nice to that person so that he'll notice me!
that is only for you and you alone to deside!
talk to class mates make friend at school.
And he also said he didn't think he would get caught...
my email adrs loves2aish@gmail.com u mail to me thanku.
SURE I THINK U ARE ANICE PERSON.
and if you end up dating him, you can never go back to being 'just friends.'
And it makes the wedding night that more special!
He said and did we manage to have 2 kids????
But plant the seed and lead her a little.
when u like a girl, try to pay close attention to the little details.
Ok first things first...   What Instatn Messenger are we talking about here?
Life is strange that way, eh?
yeah.. it is your life... dont let anyone manipulate you!
Everyone sins, but that doesn't mean you can't share the Gospel.
cam with him nude but dont show your face
it the same way white men love themself of a black women
I would never ask this in person!
moderately talkative and moderately humble...if i had one choice though, i would say talkative!!
6 months is really no time at all.
if don't want to then don't.
honestly, start a rumor that you like him.
too bad, maybe she is fat after all!
He wrote me some pretty good stuff.
i have incountered this , and it makes me irate !
get over it and find someone better.
yeah i love talkative girls a lot but humble girls are quite simple...
no  some man prefer sex with only with thier own wife.
*) It takes a LONG time to get used to it - and be honest with the children.
Try to catch her without her girls, BUT when she is in the public eye still!!
get comfterbale relax and talk about it
Slap him in the face and then RUN.
DONT DOUBT IT AND DONT SETTLE.
when you love somebody you do Anthing for them
Absolutely, that is the purpose of valentines day!
- For example I used to have a crush on this one guy...
so you think you're in love with your best friend, huh?
come on yaar...it is legal too .
Have you ever talked to her about her past relationship w/ the guy?
hope that helped you a bit.
How can i go out with him?
And yes I am in 6th Grade!
That was when I was 30 years old!!
b a good friend and do the right thing.
If you're anything like me, you'll do anything for your kids...well, here's the first BIG test.
if you don't approve of spanking, try time out!
Actually i believe in love at first sight, but that doesn't mean its meant to last.
SO IF YOU LOVE HIM SO MUCH TIME HIM TO GETS SOME HELP BEFORE ITS TO LATE!.........
Now many years later (I'm 33), my parents still hate each other !
WOULDNT YOU WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU?
-- says the 14 year old.
Sneak around and read the messages!
And I doubt he ever will.
A lot of girls find a brave guy to be very sexy
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
I JUST DON'T THINK THERES HOPE.....
how honest u are ......a  girl who always gives priority to him than any thing else...
I'd have to get to know him better, he might be a sex freak, for all I know.
I mean how do I become a friend until they break up?
You know all the good stuff!
it means u need to take a visit to the hospital.
shes not blood related so go out with her.
Are these true, that once he/she has cheated on you once before, that he/she will always do it??
Yeah, if he's always got girls hitting on him, he's probably a player.
I worked out at the gym and ran on the beach.
i dont think ur the father type anyway.
There are lots of happy, hooked up big girls.
you start talking with women, then you will have clear picture abt the woman's nature.
i hope you can find a way!
well the big questions is.. do you like the other girl?
i now that i love him but im not attracted to him at all.
my husband has a tender heart but he right down childish always about him all the time.
yes, even if a relationship didn't go well, that doesn't mean it all has to be over!
when she her close her eyes
It's better to be friends then enemies...
yeah it might be the age thing now.
only if your life depended on it.
that what happen to my friend on las vegas know that is funny
well  just avoid them stop calling or texting... they shud get the idea...  sum  gul  do me dat  lol...
its complicated cause the girl you might want might not want you.
it has set me free in a way i never knew.
some1 help me with thing that means u 2 guys and girls can help 2!!
I say both are too young.
it really hurt me and i dont know how to tell him.
So can you love at 15?
I dont thin short guys are sexy.
I didn't think there were any good men left!!
You better leave this woman, I'm telling ya...
But not really out loud, more like a chukkle or two inside my mind...
ITS NOT LIKE YOU CAN HIDE FOREVER.
women that have big hips have babies easier for some reason but don't ask me
She'll get off your back or change your phone number!
yeah it feels good, but of course there might be some side affects to it, so just think about
I hope i always have boyfriends and girlfriends.
3 is the most for me
what else can you  call it!
no matter wat u give him, he'll still know that u love him, just try to be romantic.
IT TAKES A STRONG WOMAN TO STAND BY A MAN LIKE THIS.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
just set him free and dont question him much.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.I ALSO HAVE FOUGHT SO HARD TO WHERE I AM.
then go home and be with your family.
Same way that you did before.
Just go and beat the guy you hated so much and warn him.
if that doesnt work then just ignore it.
if u really love him then it's alright
What is worse -- Being a lone or be a lone and being cheated on ?
so choices are many but take the right ones
Have some fun and take this other guy for a spin.
hey my name is___ and you are?
walk right up to him before someone else does and just say it to him...just do it.
live it to the fullest even if he is 48. live, laugh, and love
you spend too much time with her.
depends on how tired they are
How old are you and have you two dated at all?
if ur askin this question ur sh*t outa luck pal
be honest tell him face to face
it might be haha why dont you ask your father?LOL!
what your crazy that to young to have sex, even to young to think about it
if you don't that could not end pretty.
look at it from your reinds point of veiw.
she cant get mad at you if you didnt do anything.
she is hot and want to use her body for meaningless sex   she is cheap
You can have tons of friends, why ur ex?
Just talk about whatever comes to mind, be yourself and dont try so hard.
b/c when you think you in love no one can tell otherwise, you see what you wanna see.
I still love him and want him to know this because I want him bak!
I think its best if you just move on.
I guess you just tell them.
they can barely tell a grl tat they like her
You basically knows what your woman like and the kind of things she likes to do.
A fun way...hmmm....try one of my personal favs of asking a lady out: poetry.
DON'T give him your phone number, DON'T speak to him at all!
they can't deal with things like that.
THERE ARE WOMEN EVERYWHERE THAT ARE MARRIED OR SINGLE TRY THE INTERNET YOU WILL FIND YOUR ANSWERS THERE.

Later the answere will be selected through voting
coz the only part which beets fast when u r happy and beet slow when u r sad
I don't think the age difference is a problem (I am 26), but office romance can get very sticky...
since i hardly know that person.
this kind of feeling is not love it's just attraction and lust,
You Go Right To Bed... And stay there for a few Days...
No my wifes got small boobs and I love them, accually I really dont like the huge ones.
ANY MAN WHO SAYS YOU ARE OVER REACTING IS AVOIDING- YOU ARE INDEED REACTING TO SOMETHING.
I think they be fucking on the side.
you will know when it happens
wait for a lil while before you try to get over them.
I totally agree with Catnip as best answer so far.
What women does not like roses?
try spencers.com they have some good stuff right there!!
Depends,If he realy loved the girl or not.
She shouldn't freak out since she STARTED it.
If not, I would not marry him.
They think with one brain the one below the belt.
iam ivan jay iwant know about girls heart please tell about girls .thank you
think about it, u like him, he likes u, what can be better?
Once a cheater, always a cheater.
Not as your boss liking you.
Just take it easy and maybe she will come around.
just wanted s friend to talk to.
it is so hard to watch someone you love go through this from begining to end so stay strong!
ohh and try explaining to ur mom
you should kiss her when you feel the time is right thats the best way ok!
just date around and you will find it.
8 and under: If he throws dirt at you he likes ya!
I FELT IF I HAD LEFT FOR GOOD HE WOULDNT OF HAD A MOTIVE TO CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.
Just be yourself...go out & have fun together.
should i forget the kiss or persue more.
i'm also 16 and it works.
DONT GIVE HER ANYTHING GET A DIVORCE LAWYWER NOW.
you could but you shouldnt 9 is way to young .
In retrospect, like a wise man once said Don't hate the player, hate the game!
I hope everything works out for u
i dont talk that much so it's about 15 egyptian pound a mouth that's about 3 dollers :D
IF YOU WHANT THAT STUFF GET MARRIED!
and some nice stylish jeans but no holes in either!!!
but if i was a girl i would not say yes.
but when me and my wife have sex it is the best just because we comunicate with each other.
HONESTY SINCERETY BUT ONLY IF LOOKING FOR A LONG TERM MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP
I don't believe in casual dating either.
AND THE EMAILS ARE NOT YOUR IMAGINATION,  DO YOU NEED TO BE HIT OVER THE HEAD.
i think that the heart sees what it wants.
I HAVE GONE THRU SO MUCH,AND FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE YOU BY YOUR AGE.
It's gonna hurt and your not gonna find much support as the man.
i asked why he does it and he say aint i with you.
Of course, I don't believe in casual dating, either.
YES IT DEPENDS OF WHAT DOES THAT 15 YAER OLD PERSON FEEL.
But be careful, marriage is a big commintment.. Have a nice life with lucky someone!
My male best friend got in love with me, I didn't love him.
Both of you have to be willing to do this.
It surprised me at first, but after awhile...I got used to it.
but they will not stab you in the back.. by the way you are awesome...totally awesome...
you certainly dont look ready, if u were, u would not be asking questions
your best bet is to read a few books and be totally honest with your counciler.
make your boob's bigger and shake your money maker in there face at the local strip club!!
I walk and walk and think.
iN MY HOUSE, MY DAD DID ALL THE YELLING AND SPANKING AND MY MOM DID ALL THE COMFORTING.
there aren't that many girls like that that rn't sluts.
Don't worry, your time will come.
wait for him to call you
it sounds like ridiclous head games.
I actually don't believe in dating while in school.
If you do not drink, it prob.
She's probably 8 years old, or just acting stupid, alot of people ask dumb questions on here.
if your a boy who likes boys or a girl who likes girls
the max (to me) is about 6'2 er so
AND 99% OF THE TIME THEY DO FORGIVE THEM ONLY TO HAVE IT DONE TO THEM AGAIN.
But i tell you what, it is the most fulfilling experience!
if your a boy who likes boys or a girl who likes girls
the max (to me) is about 6'2 er so
AND 99% OF THE TIME THEY DO FORGIVE THEM ONLY TO HAVE IT DONE TO THEM AGAIN.
I really  realy hope so , im small too ;)
get a shrink and do all the women a favor and never contact them again!
Not if he is happy and the relationship is working out.
As far as the hubby goes...let it go.
Let's say you just got together with a guy.
Maybe he's just jealous or something.
if it were me, i would do it!
so just play by your instinct
i would say around one or one and 1&#92;2
Why couldn't you just tell him?
What is she getting out of it?
Get a life and wait some more.
AND ME AND HIM WANNA GET BACK WITH EACH OTHER WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD TELL HER BEFORE SHE STARTS TO LIKE YOU MORE.
I EVENTUALLY LEFT HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT I COULDNT AND WOULDNT DEAL WITH IT.
im probably going to be chewed for this.
dating here starts at a much later age than elsewhere.
i dont live there but i have been there many times to the bad lands
that sounds like the worst kind of cheating.
maybe george didnt stop loving you, maybe you abandoned george long ago.
grass is always greener on the other side.
ALWAYS LOVE YOURSELF MORE THAN ANY OTHER!!!
Or I say, this is my mistress or she says gentleman-lover.
You gave this man 8 years of your life and for what....excuses....move on sweety
as u say other's have commented u on it!
Try asking him if he has seen, or wants to see  a certain movie that is playing.
He would have been serious with you if he wanted you for a girlfriend.
Try asking him if he has seen, or wants to see  a certain movie that is playing.
He would have been serious with you if he wanted you for a girlfriend.
because saddly with an affair there are lies, and half truths by both of you.

I've been with my boyfriend for >EIGHT YEARS<!!!
It's just the way men (and women) are.
You went out with her because you cared for her.
if you are both still young i would say longer...
She'll either laff or jump on ya.
i am 10 so shut up.
I DON'T THINK I LOOK 2 BAD, I RESPECT AND TREAT LADIES VERY GOOD.
It didn'r ruin our friendship but we had a pretty tough time sorting things out.
Get yourself better and move on.

Oh, and no, you're not an idiot for wanting that.
i know he loves me, but after 5 yrs i want a commentment
I can't find any good guys around here.
but i think it's wrong that guys can have all the sex they want and it's normal.
but personally i have found a guy that can keep up with me.
because they think they can get away with it.
rule number one you cant make people like you.
go out and eat, go play asport.
who cares about what your friends think.
go out, get to know each other.
I think it is too bad ,even thinking of it.
Burning you witt a cig butt.
Don't worry yourself about this girl.
Be yourself ... Don't follow anyone be unique as u are!
If your under 16, then probably not.

YOU SHOULD TELL HER THAT YOU DONT THE SAME FEELINGS AS HERS.
long enough dont until you know that he is the one for you
Valentine's Day is coming up....start thinking young again and get with it to renew your marriage!!!
can some really fall in love at the age of 12?
so, if he's worth waiting for, hang in there.
sounds like u are just gettin bored of it.
they don`t want you to dump them.that`s why they lie
most of the fights are about stupid things and it's really just aggravating.
I find it amazingly hard to believe, you don't see that.
he still trys to avoid me.
Even though it might take acouple bad times to find that.
remember you have a tongue,and most enjoy...
just go up and say hi and start asking her about her hobbies or something.
Give him a really good BJ, that always makes me :)
and lol make sure she is ready or she might freak.
I talk to her online but she dosent usuly im me i have to start the converstaions.

4. just say you're single, if you really are....
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IS MADE 4 U...

The one thing that I never did waz be so attached to a boy it waz overwhelming.
You are all to young to date!
If all that fails and your parents won't do anything CALL DR.PHIL
Go out and buy yourself a knock out top and some pants and doll yourself up just turn heads.
if you do have a relationship don't you want to think twice.
I DONT KNOW ABOUT ALL THA OTHER EXCESS BAGGAGE THAT COMES ALONG WIT HAVING SEX WITHOUT A CONDOM THOUGH!
self-centeredness... and if I don't watch it, spending too much time on Answers
you respect that she's with someone else and you move on.
Don't let him do it to you...Get out.
If it was forced tell if it wasnt and she wanted it leave it be she made her decision
Why u wanna mess with someone elses woman
is that a flashlight in your pocket or are you happy to see me
I typically don't stand there and ogle them, but I do look (my hubby is hot).

I so sorry, but I totally agree with simpson.

IF YOU LOVE THAT PERSON OR SEE A FUTURE WITH THEM THEN SURE ITS WORTH IT.
My best friends are like family.
It is definately the best way.
A girl is not about her boobs.
do men want love are just fun
stop looking Mr RIGHT where u r. break d common ground dat u r used 2. start of fresh.
beats me i had the same problem but stoped liked that girl after a while .
sweetie he is never going to leave his wife, ever.
somebody else is being prepared for you
If you don't have looks or money lets face it you have to be fun.
put a note on your back saying: i'm single, anybody interested?
if you guys really love each other everything is going to be alright.
girl don't know have the same problem
NOT THAT MUCH BECAUSE SHE WAS YOUR AGE ONCE BUT IT WILL GET BETTER.
and i've kept my word to this day.
no i don't belive at first sight.
i KNOW my best friend is weird, and thats part of what I love so much about her!!
maybe..... i think you guys are totally rushing it too....
Because they aren't truely a best friend.
in one of those study booths at the library at university
BUT HE HAS ABOUT LOST HIS BUSINESS AND HIS HOUSE AND EVERYTHING FINACIALLY .
would you move on or would you hang in there for a while longer hoping.
maybe because you are together for too long time :)
I would lose my shit if I were that guy.
Eventually the big ones just lay there like a pair of dead ol beaver tails.
to take ur honesty from u. be smart and keep it up!!!!!!!!
she'll be bowled over!and if she likes u too then u r the happiest man on the world!
Of course you should be friends.
Just tell them you are straight!
Wear that special dress and do your hair up nice!
I don't suggest using it though.
Should C be told she misunderstood D?
I don't think your over reacting at all!!
if she knows the truth, she'll actually know what the problem was, and the huge mistake she made!
whippings ARE too harsh but a swat on the butt otr the hand isn't!
You can't just keep taking, something has got to give ...
when he avoids u, avoid him dont look for him.
You are a real person with real emotions!
No I say , this is my woman-friend and I am her man-friend.
My answer to this question is ADULTS ONLY  Barbie N
girls can be hypersensitive, and boys don't understand why.
If she says no then it wasn't meant to be.
try antonio banderas-spirit...is cool,but don't use too much
whatever, give the girl a chance.
but remember any good friend never do this to his/her friend.
Tell him he picked a whore.
She likes having sex with many different guys.
once rested, then you can let the good times roll!
and if he c**s  - you did it right!
i personally think that women have a much higher sex drive than men.
if tell the people shut the FUCK up.
the truth is they want a little bit of both
I think it will still be PARIS...
your looking in the wrong places.
You can do this...you have it in you!
i REALLY dont think thats likely.
that means that he really likes you.
first of all...how is he considered your boyfriend?
Lesbians I can tolerate, they don't seem so gross to me.
Not all men are like this though.
if you enjoy wearing dipers, keep wearing them FOREVER!!
because it seems boys have different rules than we do...
if you have 4 women that you can hang out with why are you asking questions on yahoo.
I ready and he ready because we both play field and realize what true love is.
try Stuart Florida, west palm beach that area
Stop and think about how youd feel if your mans ex-women and him were still e-mailing each other!
ALSO, WHY DID YOU SLEEP WITH YOUR BESTFRIEND AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL HIM.
all the guys i like r taken n nobodys ever asked me out...i m not desperate, happily single,just curious
or go w/ the best kittie cat .
move on and get with him if he CRAWLS begging back to you if youre still interested
seek marriage counseling,2 wrongs don't make one right.
He might say no, but big deal!
Now you need to ask yourself why you don't trust her?
Forget cheating, dating a criminal is worse!
600,000 might be a bit too many!
Remeber that and have fun you are only young once.
If it doesn't work out, then ask if you can go back to being friends.
you are too young to be with her in the first place you need to get away from her
If he doesn't want the package deal to move on.
yes if both of you are active and adventurous...you just need a lot of lubricant
If you just broke up it'll be awkward for both of you for awhile.
if you love your husband you can not do it with any one else.
threw an afternoon party, invite your future gf.
because i even got into the situation (which was months ago), our friendship is still on very thin ice.
u ve a long life to leave y in a hurry
try to tell her change her mind+dont approch her very caring but dont let her down
It doesn't matter WHERE he gets his appetite as long as he EATS AT HOME!!
well he does thats the way they act
Not if you're on here all the time!
Get a life and do your homework!
well, his eyes will tell u.
i felt so guilty that i was there.
O.o  in my friends boy roof wit my friends boy woooooo yea u should try it....
don't worry the TIME will alert you.
he on the outher hand don't.
Why do so many have to be mean?
Something gross, if you have to.
there's nothing special about it if their isn't something in the kiss.
If so go for it and dont worry .
i think in your mid to late 20's your more mature.
do you really want all that emotional baggage the second time around?
Don't give him an ultimatum either.
You aint UGLY if you think that you look REAL GOOD 2 me!
Sounds like both of you like living in fantasy land...not reality.
sand in pizzas.that male organ is for that****** female organ.so use it there.
i say hold your head up and love with all your heart.
WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOVING IS THE WAY WE FEEL.
yeah, I have 2 agree with pagan_earthgirl.
Sorry, can't stop laughing at Ericmaypother!!!
The only way to hook up with the RIGHT girl is to JUST BE YOURSELF.
Ever shopped @ Tiffany's & Co.
whatever you do, don't toy with their hearts.
Some women, like myself loves jewelry.
If you mean, Should married people have sex?
maybe but i don't kno u soo i guess not until i kno who u r :)
if you really love him, hold on.
If not, then either learn to love her quirkiness or find yourself a less outrageous best friend!
only you can answer thse questions honestly
is that what your BF looks like?
i think its that men and boys tend to think less deeply than girls and women.
Yeah its better, but it is worth it.
but i will tell you this look at hot guy yourself.
I dated a girl from Kazakhstan and we had the hottest dirties sex ever.
because some girls just are not use to nice guys.
because most men don't realize a good thing until it is good and gone, men are backwards
If that man would actually CHEAT with you.
is bad of u cos u hurt him,well still let him know ur reason in a matual way,
Try talking to him and get him into rehab!
Uhhh that took 1 more of those almost extinct brain cells to come up with didn't it LOL
he acts like he likes me
ur family knows and they don't care.
It may not seem like it now but they really do know what is best for you.
You damn kids with this boogie jive nonesense, ingnorant as hell!
Good luck anh have patience with da love thang.
go dutch when you go out.
I hate saying this to you.
are you certain that he loves you?
Dont even do it to yourself.
you have STD and you have sexual smell and malformation problems :P
wait for the right person and right moment... probably after 17...
that's fifteen o's and seven of them were mine!
fuck her a few more times.... shel quit!!
Or, maybe someone got dumped one day when he had bad heart burn ;D
in my idea ... is too have someone to love and love you back in return.
if what u like it doesn't matter.
No they are both to young!
good luck and i hope things work out for the best!
Well, I don't but I wouldn't call myself typical.
just keep it in your mind, not everyone has to be in love and have BF
i was 16 ,seems like it lightyears ago and i am only 22
u need to wait til she and you r more matured.
The guy didn' even know I liked him for years!
stick with him if u believe he is the person for u
Has he always flirted like this?
Don't ever go fishing where you work at.
Good luck dont try so hard!
i rub money all over my body and i cant keep the women off of me
what everybody else says doesn't matter.
im sure you might just get the response that you want from him.
hell yeah, then slap the ho for thinking she ws gonna keep it!
And don't chase after too many girls at once, we like to think we're special!
Ya' did the nasty with him?
but you should determen how hard you swat/spank them according to their age!
would u like to know if you were her?
I FEEL THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP IT,BUT SHE ASKED ME IF I WANTED IT BACK, I SAID NO!
You don't talk to her during sex, do you?
Someone once said that I was a no good crack whore.
she freaked out because you are 12.
Its not love trey it lonely.
and teaches women how men think.
Just pull your thingy out in front of her.
No... it's not a drunken bash, it's a wedding.
WE STILL LIKE HER BETTER EVEN THOE SHE WAS TRICKING US, BECAUSE SHE SUCKERED US WHEN WE WERE YOUNG.
is there really lust at 1st sight?
No not always some yes but some no depends on the girl really
is there any way you call him and ask him to explain it to you?
Learn from it and don't be that stupid again.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
very very very bad to mix business with love.
be yourself, thats all i have to do, and i have the best friends in the world!
just have safe sex rest is ok...
when i met my boyfriend i wasnt even looking for anyone he just came into my life.
no but Im looking for one
First off BE HONEST with both of them .
Eat a whole lot of oysters
Sometimes all us guys want to do is ummm, you know.
he is a radio personality .
I feel confused because i feel between.
dont make her do anything that she wouldnt want her to.
na and honestly I wouldn't worry about the labels of gay straight or bi it's all a blur anymore
true love is hard to come bye.
I don't go out with guys, if there's no spark, no oomph.
i don't want to brake up with him, i love him.
i understand exactly how u feel and my husband cheated alot on me.
do not be afraid he shouldn't bite...
tell em you're straight and if that don't work punch em in the gut and chest gut first.
i dont really know, but maybe you could try being close friends with him.
Guys like ALL types of girls, you just have to be patient.
On my parents second story patio facing the main road....with my butt totally exposed.....WHAT A RUSH!!
he treats me good and supports are family, hes a great guy.
go to paris resort, you miss italy?

all i could do was think about my boyfriend.
do what ever it takes to save the most valuable thing in your life.
stay there with them at their place for a month or two ... then bring them home with you...
And what happens when you blow your nose?
That is not true, so dont buy into it.
see witch one knows you more andchoose that guy
You ask him to leave his wife and he picks on you?
uhh not much u cood really do @ this point tho .
Especially if u haven't seen eachother for a while.
You have already atarted a life together!!
or it is just totally emotional rise(peak) of love (infatation) ??
Why would ya want to pull out.
man, i am just now getting over a love that ended 3 years ago.
sometime they get on my nerves but friendss are friends
i know plenty of women who love sex too!
sexy eyes, big muscular chest, nice buns..... and an honest, loving heart to match.....
Be yourself, laugh and have fun.
no one is gonna help u.
Why would you even get w/ someone when you knew they were married.
if he likes you great if he doesn't move on !
lol .. why are you offering?
RUN FAST HE IS A JERK
The couple that plays together, stays together!
finish the party at 5 pm or so.
bring it up in a casual conversation with that person or wait until they ask.
sweetheart if your love is true you can do it.
then what kind of message am I sending them?
you gave her the gift becuase she was special.
well duh, if u dont go now, when will u?
ok...do guys find skinny girls more attractive or toned ones?
HI I AM A SINGLE BLACK MALE IN CINCINNATI OHIO LOOKING FOR A E-MAIL PARTNER TO CHAT WITH.

Anything intriguing about her.. something about the way she talks, walks, does something.. anything.
IT ISN'T ALWAYS US LOVING MEN.
Yes so maybe they get back together
#1 think to do is pray!
its not a big deal, but mostly it makes them feel good about themselves.
THERES ALWAYS SOMEONE BETTER OUT THERE AND IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.
Girl, it always works like that.

and try to be funny because everybody loves that.
DON'T LET HIM KNOW YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM....BIG MISTAKE!!!

It's also okay to swallow if you like!

You gave it away and now hes gonna to the next one.
Thats how people can find out if ur single.
But u said tyhere is no middle ground for u,,, it's friends(not seeing eachother) or sex!
Dont worry this is not true...
im assuming because thoe omen that are dating the married men really dont want a big comitment
he probably likes you but doesnt want his friends to know.
we broke up and i just want to be friends.
have fun with all of them and look for the 5th woman she might be the one!
i think if you can count them all on your own 2 hands you should be good.
listen up honey i am 32 and i have a relationship with a 52 year old man.
I knew this girl and I really cared about her.
i guess i always had hope we could be together again, now i know we cant.
SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THIS SITE LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.
May be he is not gay... may be he is thinking that he is a gay?
no such thing on the web.
HE IS EXTRA THRISTY ON YOU,TELL HIM TO BAG BACK.
ask yourself if you would take a bullet for him.
not scared to do whatever !!!!!
I think you sure are gay release and deal
because you eather like him or you dont want to she her get hurt.
I can date an ugly guy, but not a dumb or clichedly funny guy
having women in my life most of my life.
just take control and do it, girl!
And just randomly walkng up and hugging me, things like that mean the world!
find out what country and go there for a vacation and meet some one.
his smell and whispers at the back of the neck
follow your heart... and if ur ex broke up w/ u, forget him...
Because you look like a fossil......  You have your remnants...
uh...YOU DON'T, I feel sorry for your wife.You are an ass.
When emotions are all in our brain...
i non,t no go fuck my ass
the short version: don't do it.
if he does, what are you worried about?
uh...YOU DON'T, I feel sorry for your wife.You are an ass.
When emotions are all in our brain...
i non,t no go fuck my ass
the short version: don't do it.
if he does, what are you worried about?
Go to My space.com or Runescape My name is arbitor28 NO SPACES!!
well me personaly i love sports and taking girls out on a date
If you still love her, just keep doing that.
he's awesome and everything, but do i love him?
SO WHAT IF WE LOVE THE FEELINGS, WE ALL BELIEVE IT'S HIM, EVEN HIM.
well f**k her again u stuck it in once why not make it a second time???
i'd have to agree ...he's a loser..and he doesn't deserve you if he likes you...
IF YOU CAN STILL WAIT.... GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT PERSON FOR YOU.
they hate it when you do it and i betcha he wont do it no more.
But there should be a whole lot of other stuff going on than just that!
They dont need to it just feels good so they want it more!!!!
YOU NEED TO GIVE GUYS A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE.
tell her what u feel that is what friends r for
Must be nice....  And us guys get a total of 15 seconds of bliss....  Blahhh
MY HUSBAND IS HAPPY BUT WHAT CAN i DO TO MAKE HIM MORE HAPPY?
friendship is like 2 souls in 1 body.
I HAVE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES.
even if they don't really know what it means to be bisexual.
Then no matter what u want 2 do - it's all legal.
on valentine's day do the nasty.
see if you can find help for her.
for me i talk to my bf everyday.
they dont want to scew things up
do you still believe you will go to hell if you r naughty ??
porn is for the weak,unimagitive,and undateable...try counseling
But, sad because I wasted so much time (7 years), and angry well, for the obvious.
THEN SHE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BLINDED IDIOT MAN.
hell yah boy it is good for the soul will i love sex so i dont know about u.
(but i'm not trying to make you feel bad.ok?)
maybe your having dream about her because you really like her.
let her know you love her and that you care about the relationship that you both have started.
Sure...they have the same sensibility as girls :D
Oh...Its a good time to put in a lot of over time too.....Always Forward
12 and under: If you ever pass him a note and he writes back, he likes ya!
a friend is someone special, someone who you can tell everything.
BUT THE FALLING IN LOVE I'M THINKING ABOUT( NO!)
think of all good years that you 2 has shair.
spice it up is my opinion.
as long as you are 17 or over
its hard to want to be around someone that mopes around all day not doing any thing.
it depends on how good the girls is
Personally I love a guy in a suit
But my boyfriend thinks that I still have feelings for him.
you can find boys easily but not friends
think of it,most guys these days r afraid of a bit of competition.
Someone please help me out with this!
Just be yourself and have fun!
or u could make the toss up.
2 b w/ 4 women u gotsa b a player??
Come on girl... you can do better!
just grab his hand and if he doesnt like it dump him because that means he doesnt like you
you been watching too many porn movies!
i had it happen to me.
he didn't say that he loves you so i wouldn't jump to conclusions.
THEN HE REALIZED THAT ALL DRUGS DO IS TAKE YOU DOWNHILL.
no, some guys love them because the cute and perky and dont get in the way
those verizon stands at the mall sell all kinds, i'm sure u could find wat u need there
i would say about 2 years after they learn to talk
- Goodness gracious great balls of fire...
It varies--some asian girls are VERY hot, but some aren`t.
they don't have money to buy a larger bra, i guess.
kiss yourself in a mirror first to get a field of it then try it on her
where is he and why ?
He'll wonder all day whats up!
You're a jerk and a loser.
take a drive down the road and pick up a hooker
Try as much as u can to avoid some if not all, the things that leads to the problem.
you were probably good friends in the beginning, don't lose it.
another fun idea is riding snowmobiles/4 wheelers.
YES U SHOULD CUZ THATS NOT RIGHT COMING FROM BOTH OF THEM.
I just don't feel very comfortable when I know a person is gay.
then it will mean more to him and to you.
Most guys are oblivious if girls like them, so just go for it girl!
LOVE LAST INFATUATION IS SHORT TERM.
after class he walks me to my car...carries my stuff
sometimes they do it just depends on how soft the guy is.
a friend is some one that is alwayz there 4 u wether its when ur sad,happy,deppresed,or crying
Quit beating yourself up and GO ASK HIM OUT!!!
THIS QUESTION IS IN THE COMPLETELY WRONG EFFING CATEGORY AND YOU SHOULD PUT IT RIGHT.

THIS MIGHT COME AS A SHOCK BUT YOUR MOM HAS A RIGHT TO FREAK.

Don't let anyone tell you different.
And liberals women are totally hot.
REALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY AND EASY TO DO KILL UR BEST FRIEND ...
Do you know what I mean?
If you like this guy then go for it.
If you find out she likes you too, then i think youve got a pretty good chance.
Say I Love you and I can do everything for you
Don't think she doesn't have another guy.
It's like a magical shrinking spell!
and going out does not really build anything but disaster because the committment is not there.
No, you don't need an excuse to cheat.
i dont believe i have been disappointed too many times
divorce him before  you get a desease
i would like boys to notice me and like me,but nobody seems to like me
Im a girl but trust me, I know these things.
this is the only life you got.
I guess it not ok, but i wonder why others do not consider the problems after having sexual intercourse.
as a 16 yearold how many promises have you kept?
I think every guy is like that.
In the Buttocks  -is that what you meant?
your either to old or to young in any case i guess yahoo knows what they are doing!
I don;t think so I'VE HEARD SOME HORROR STORIES.
get real....he is someone else's husband.
contact people you know that know him and get info on how to contact him.
My boyfriend did that to me and told it to me straight.
maybe there is no such thing as best marriage because we are all human and prone to mistakes.
Common man don't waste ur life 4 someone who doesn't give a damn about u.
Grunt (lol) or ask her name 2.

Some women get huge boobs in fifth grade some women get huge boobs after they get pregnant.

ur friends should b friends (go figure) and accept it.
people lies for having sex with another women.
maybe your not ment to get over them if you love them that much.

I like doing them both, but I try not ask to much, don't wanna lose those points ya know.

I guess there is nothing with that!
WHat are you saying NO to?
Why does your dating this boy worry her so much?
Just ask him to buzz off and move on with life.
WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS I WANT TO MEET SOMEONE WHO I CAN CONNECT WITH.
hey guy,live your life for yourself,you'll never please all the people all the time
A) Cruise seediest street in your city.

I`m sure you 2 have talked about it?
So go ahead and do what you gotta do.
Whats the worst that can happen?
what does this mean and what should i do?
Don't use pick up lines no matter what...
give consistant attention.. smile to her, and remember, eye-contact...... ask her for lunch
Some women never get huge boobs.
But don't even respond to it.
they wouldnt want u stepping in.
and then i go smack him upside his head.
I think it was a little over the top, I mean, a note????
he will never leave his wife, you have to leave him.
I sorry, I keep writing but I just feel so bad.
if u like him then u should
IS THAT THE TYPE OF FRIEND THAT U HAVE COME ON NOW WAKE UP
then...i must say, that's a different issue already.
I can't see any reason why you would have to wait for him?
No matter how hot the woman, some guy somewhere is tired of banging her.
Just because you break up doesn't mean someone has to be the bad guy.
That was my problem at the start too till I read an interesting article, I dont remember where.
for him to call you and to not forget.
have you ever introduced your boyfriend to your friends???
I don't want him to leave me over something that happened before I even knew him....
You asked, I'ma answer...YES, YOU'RE AN IDIOT!
Oh yeah,  if he makes you take your shoes off to get in the car, DUMP HIM!!!!!!!!!
My boyfriend sits around and watches porn with out me.

When I got married I actually got my cake from a Grocery Store.. it was about 100.00.

if the person you like ain't making the move GIRL MAKE THAT MOVE
You don't have to come right out and say Are you cheating on me?!.
Yes becaz I dont have a best friend so It wouldnt matter any why
give him some options you quit or we are leaving.
If you have to think about this one then your not a friend.
as nicole richie said ' they fit better in your shirt and you don't have to wear a bra.'
I don't even count no more it's almost infinity.

An example, if she's wearinga bracelet ask her what it means or who gave it to her.
just gain confidence in who you are.
You're even dreaming about this girl now, huh?

and be the mother that U always wanted.

Hey you know girls are not just like apples.

keep up the good work, there are too many other things in life to worry about.

IN MOST CASES ITS NOT THE PERSONS FAULT THAT THEYRE SICK.

OR JUST FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD DO YOU BETTER YOU DON'T NEED YOU CHILDREN KNOWING ABOUT DRUGS.
The same reason why we look at the hot men, its only normal!
make sure it is very special.
why r u taking all this shit?
hold his first, or put your arms around him
not everyone is going to agree to your marrage.even if your family didn't want you to it shuoldn't matter.
Think about who you get along with best and who you are more comfortable with.
Not that there's an age restriction on being in love but 15 is still VERY young.
Do either of you have kids?
cut him loose and find another guy that will treat you right
he is not afraid of loosing you because you have been there for him for so long.
so the hot girl gets all the attention.
She hugged me, saying over and over: mine.
I met this really hot chick at a club and she turned out to be a 'he'.
'nd what esle can be your business with your ex!
a friend is someone you can trust, someone kind of like you.
With the K. West song Golddigger .
i jsut wanted to follow up on that 'friends' rule for exes(its a joke)' and it might just work
IF YOU DUMP HER CAN I GET HER NUMBER?

20 and under: If he bootlegs a fifth for ya, he likes ya!
yes that is the true love
Why are you with this guy?
who knows but at least guys tell you they want to see other people women just do it
Don't get pregnant, don't fall in love.
If your considering it just because its what you know and its comfortable for you to go back.
in my friends boy roof wit my friends boy woooooo yea u should try it....
guys have more fizical powe so they don't use fake to gain something, woman does more than men!
And just tell him...GUESS WHAT...WE ARE HAVING THIS ONE!!
my dada is 6'5 and peaple look at him like he's a freak.
it helps to know what your doing when it comes to sex!
Best of luck to you,  Rascal
It ALWAYS comes back to bite you in the ass.
Honestly though it dosn't look like you have looked around that.
when you marry you promiss to be faithfull and loyal.
be honest and say that you like her as a friend and don't want to hurt her.
Anyhow, try to do something esle such as working hard, doing sports and hang out with friends.
your ready when you are married but thats my 2 cents.
Like Where can u find a sexy single teenage boy?
booooi, u need a fucking life, how u gonna go online and ask bitches to marry u?
it depends on what area your big, honey!
First off, you are a very bad person for dating a married man!
i am here why wait give me a kiss.hmmmmmmmmmmaaa
Always but with the righht guy at the right time!
LOVE IS LIKE THIS--ITS NEVER PERFECT,,,
18+ to film it, you just have to be within 4 years if you're under 18
i dunno wat to get him.
Sometimes we are perfectly happy at home.Just want some strange...Same old food gets extremely boring./
Do not do it with any one .....
or if your too young dont use any food just hold hands and stare into eachothers eyes
WE ONLY LISTENED TO DAD OUT OF FEAR.
If all else fails take off the wedding ring!
And if he still don't commit, it's time to quit.
I DID COME BACK TO HIM.
just ask him and then you'll know better than to go thru life not knowing
Ask yourself is he worth the wait?
sit her down and talk to her thats all i can think of.
think about it you would get like that if you were him.
that is great u still have your flower.
someone that is up for anything.
make her wher nothing and sleep with you no bra no nothing
get a job and help carry the load.
it sounds like you might rrgret it if you do.
There are other guys out there.
love is when you care so much for someone you will do anything for them.
i LOVE HIM VERY MUCh What can I do?
hmmmm dunno but not trojan or lifestyles i have two kids to prove they dont work...LMAO
I'd freak out, but that's cause I'm a guy.
no i don't think its wrong, you're not blood  related, and she's your true love.
someone once told me i was gay!!!
Wat can I do to stop her.
You are not going out with him, NO is already there.
He definitely wants you if he carries your stuff.
the most has ever been 7
Because you love someone doesn't mean that they will love you.
hmmm, probably se couldn't control herself.
wait untill you've had sex ed .
or if its not embarassing u can ask a counsellor to hepl u out.
if he loved you he would do that to hurt you.
You don't want tp push them away.
GOD HELP YOU BE STRONG MY BROTHER
just pik the one that makes u happiest .
depends, how much money do you make?
nope, gotta know you first and maybe we can work things out...
Why Marry if you want to cheat?
i feel so guilty about this.
well men want love but find few men that are out for one thing.
well cucumbers, if you're into that sort of thing
unless yuo knew each other b4.
just go up and ask him
there is a guy and i REALLY need to know if he likes me.
when we love what we love becomes a part of us!good or bad
But i have 2 woman in mi life at this moment that i love.
men get more jelous than women.
you never go wrong with that.
it was my neighbor, she had just watched my boyfriend(now exboyfriend) beat me up in the front yard.
Wheneva u have a responsible man around...
If you want to give him time to realize he wants a life with you, then do it.
Work and private lives should be kept separate anyway...don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable in the workplace, yuck!
Why don't you ask HIM out???
as soon as he'll let you.
i mean girls have hormones to and desires but they do it and it's like o she's easy.....
There are lots of good single guys.
If she says yes, Go and enjoy!
wayyy better than a chat room.
first, what ever you do talk to the girl that he broke up with!!!
There are lots of good single guys.
do what every you can until you want to pull out the whips & chains.
If she says yes, Go and enjoy!
wayyy better than a chat room.
first, what ever you do talk to the girl that he broke up with!!!
um anything on a note saying you like him (duh)
I dont think I have too explain
I wondered that too, cause evertime they split up Dapne always go with Fred.
but if you love her tell her maybe it'll work!
Now I just laugh about it.
tell that you want a ring and they will relise you are single
i can't speak for all guys  but i like small women
it all depends: how long is he asking you to wait?
it depends on what your looking for, but its always somebody for everybody
I just went with it and didn't take it bad or anything.
you are too young to have a girlfriend.
Then you get up and go on.
Looks mean nothing in a girl.
YES, THA FEELING IS MUCH BETTER!!
and tehy ended out ok. plus she isn't really related.
4 times in one night back to back

Why dont you just ask him?
just hang in there and Mr.
tell him that you like him more than a brother bcause from what i read he likes you to
i totaly agree with the first guy
Let's face it, sex is all they think about and want most of the time!
it just depends on u.concentrating on studies experiencing what u have doesnot hurdle ur goals.
Just have sex Dont care about anything
I admit, I flirt (with my much younger boss!)
Whwether a guy or girl, your body language can say a lot.
Okay do u think it is approciate for his kids to be calling u mommy.
Gracias for the points, though, lol...LOL!
Hi (insert boys name here), Would you go to the dance with me?
my friend uses it and i cant stand it when he does!
be yourself bro and show them you like and care for them.
LET ME BE INTERESTED IN YOU TOO DON'T SUFFOCATE ME.
Go with the one that feels better!
well they are at the right spot.
The boy will flirt back, and then probably start liking you.
good luck.... Men are easier to figure out than women try the dinner and blow  thing.. it works :))
both...without these two love will not be complete...
If you want to be happy don't do it.
no.. its not... my wife is hedious
that would be a greatest mistake on her entire life!!
Well, ima guy so if a cute girl asked me out, id say yes.
TEST IT FIRST - you don't want to end up with a numb boner!
think about that person all the time.. feeling flushed.. cant think straight...
THIS WOMAN WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND LEAVE YOU HIGH AND DRY IN DEBT UP TO YOUR EYEBALLS.
well, dont try this at home ;p
Yeah but you have to be pretty mature
you will always want what you can't have.
Don't let him go like that go on and tell him!
u just have to ignore some certain things for peace to reign.
Just smile at him & let him feel that u r always noticing him!
well a rose and lots of kisses and hugs.
it depends on whether or not u like the guy.
nOT TRUE BUT DON'T COME ON TOO STRONG YOU GUYS DO THAT A LOT.
(however, this doesnt apply if you are like...10.)
So just call around and ask.
Like you said, lying ACTUALLY MAKES IT WORSE.
The first was when she was in college, the second only 3 years later.
YOU ARE A SICKO AND AVENGED SEVENFOLD DOES NOT SUCK.
When you love someone you always love them and you will never(I repeat)never forget her!
Well unless the girls say they are.
That means you DON't get a woman, you have one.
He tries to tell me what to do and he isint my daddy!
I know what I want and my advice to if you really want marriage then leave.
I HAVE TRIED DATING AND TO BE HONEST I DONT LIKE IT.
just be your self and good luck
no matter what happens you will no how he feels afterwards!
if that doesn't work then just keep yourself busy always.
think about it, you can get naughty and never get dirty.
congratulations...dont forget the invitation and the wish list :-)
If I'm in a terrible marriage (I hope I won't be!)
I smiled and the rest is history!!
Flowers and candy  chicks dig that stuff dude!
You should ask him, nothing says you can't.
Chat rooms are just a tease to me.
quitters never win... and winners never quit.
We have 2 kids and I love him veary much.
#3 if thou has patience thou can conquere anything
HE cant wait to see you?
But now i miss him and i want him back should i go back out with him?
Yea if you like him, havent you seen Friends lol

PASSION GET AWAY FROM US IF YOU WANNA BE MEAN!!

he he falls over.lol.dont bite.lol.oh, eat a breath mint and blow gently.
how do i solve this dilema, its nerve wrecking,because i really like her.
sacrifice your career and then she'll complain that you don't bring enough money home .
VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY EASY AS WE MAKE UP OUR MIND
if you do get married then you should thank your aunt.
i mean girls always like surprises.
weve only been dating close to 5 months, and we're in the ages of 14-16 just so u kno
in some corner of ur heart says that to go n talk with her express ur feeling.
C'mon that makes no sense at all...You really liked the guy and you pretended not to like him?
with love and a good new project in life
So i might be setting my self up to get hurt
Ask her if she's met any guys too.
they probably wonder if she can spell
Ok velma and shaggy no but Fred and dalphane yes but in real life no
If u are going for family planning;then better take care dude :)
Stop and think about each women.
if u wanna that presentation u can mail me at shakya.b@gmail.com for that.
of course he has feelings for his wife because he will never leave her.
He would realize what I mean to him and what we mean to each other.
i am in a relationship with this boy, but my friends don't really like him.
JUST SAY HER SORRY ,,, SHE WILL BE URS ....TRY IT
Now shes dating another guy that I've always hated, and its tearing me apart.
He might just get the hint, if not, then say, Hey, why don't we go together!?
Ok, she may just not be ready to talk about it yet.
thta smy naber popen 0020125036491u can coll me
you know im not a man but my ex from long ago.
Cuddle with me, hold my hand, hug and kiss me, then have amazing sex with me!
I doubt you'll watch much tv.
Im havin trouble with my moms bf.
Have her get checked, ya know for stds.
But maybe you can say, I want to get married, but I am not going to wait.
yup dear because its a part of marriage having sex its an action of love
when they try to pick on you are be arond you alot why
turn the situation around for him and see if he still feels it's innocent
Not to many men like that.
If u r talking about urself,ur not suppossed 2 b on YA if ur under 13,and NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Do Not!
true love comes along when you least expect it too!!!
he likes u if he acts mean or acts like u dont exist.
if she has nice arms she usually will have a nice body
yes you should, you trusting in a guy is as important as a guy trusting in you.
maybe you aren't spending enough time w/ your kids so they misbehave to get you attention?!?!
You said he cheated on her, maybe he's cheating on you WITH her...old habits die hard!
theres kids here and any 1 could lie and say there like 18
Small boobs aren't a bad thing....ugly boobs are.
Talk it over with your mom.
my best friend is worth more than money
and watch his face after you ask him.
i don't want to seem rude...but what goes around comes around.
Seriously I'd be telling that boyfriend to hit the road.
It is not wrong at all
because they are more risk taking and they make life more spontaneous
For men I think is better and bad.
Seriously I'd be telling that boyfriend to hit the road.

For men I think is better and bad.
is there any way you take him to an adviser?
say sorry, tell her you love her, write her a letter, show her how much you care.
He ain't your's (he's his wife) and you need to stay away and get outta his life.
ITS JUST UP TO YOU IF YOU THINK HE HAS POTENIAL TO CHANGE IN A GOOD WAY.
he knows he can look but he cant touch.
G Moore -  Other men have seen angels, but i have seen thee, and thou art enough.
21 and over: If his friends know your name, he likes ya!
you could say i've gotten better!
and i am gettign worried and i cant stop thinking about her.
once you lose that you never get it back.
I know it ALWAYS hurts the kids (esp.
The best week you ever lived?
(Is that just angry love, hmmmm)....
a fifteen year old has hormones telling her she is in love.
I'm picking too that just what it is.
I want a bf who can be physically present in my life.
NO BUT LIKE AT 1ST SITE
If you want to spend the rest of your life with that person, what's 2 years?
Thats always a turn on for me!
around 2 years old if your trying to potty train try pull ups
IN THE LONG RUN, IF YOU MARRY HER, SHE KNOWS IF YOU DIE, SHE WILL GET YOUR NET WORTH.
sounds like you can save it if you do.
Any breakup is a hard one!
if she really is your friend you shouldnt.
Hey man, you are best friends for a reason.
think about it maybe you  find the answer...
hang out with more people and make a lot of friends.
Don't do it to yourself you deserve so much better!
more than females do yes we need it more than you girls
My aunt married her boss, no problems!
like get a girlfriend and paste the picture of both of u on line or ignore her.
Best of luck - not an easy situation.
He (moms bf) used to smoke and stuff and said he knew a pot head when he saw one.
if he's a good friend to you he will help u take care of the baby.
If something does not feel right then don't do it.
u need to tell em that who u go oput with is ur buisiness!
None that I can write here...
when u have butterflies in your stumache when ever your around him
that seems to knows what he wants.
im not gay but i am a bisexual & i want to have other peoples opinion on it.
i am in the same boat that you are, my man cannot give it to me enough.
Just wait until you find the right person!
i was so mad at her, but what could i do?
If a guy doesn't want you, he's not worth it and it's his loss.
Try talking her out of it.
I want to tell my brother what I did, but I want to stop that crazy b*tch before.
do something new, try new things out.
Some actually do care about a girls personality.
then she is trying to her best to salvage a bad situation.
i mean, there are so many brothers out there trying to go for it, but only few succeed.
Hope this helps a bit.Good luck
sleeping when it is cold, swiming when it is hot
>>Whatever you do, NEVER ask can I kiss you?
A lot of local radio stations have sites like that... At least here in ohio.
i'd say yes no questions about it.
in your heart, you know what to do.
When you care about the person and they are all you think about, then you are in love.
if he is a gay how he made love with you night before he goes?
my siblings are so annoying, i can't live with them.
i Think it all depends on how much you love the girl.
15 but then not again until i was 18
i guess, sometimes we wanna be bad our selves.
umm....by never sayin that gettin a life and stop bein a jackass yupp that covers it
But that still doesn't mean we don't love you.
u have to find a girl first talk 2 them and find out what they want.
JUST BE SMART ABOUT IT THOUGH.
tell him he may be losing a wife.
u have to find a girl first talk 2 them and find out what they want.
JUST BE SMART ABOUT IT THOUGH.
if he ask why tell him that maybe you should see other people.
sounds like to me you take your vouls to heart.
tell him he may be losing a wife.
But don't make it a game forever, that just messes with everyones minds.
but think about it..... if it wasnt you in this position then it would be someone else.
Yeah I think so about fred and daphne, but not shaggy and velma.
you can't control who you love no matter what the age.
you're a too young to worry about stuff like that!!
try to break his bones next..
we are only 16 but we have bentogether 4 3years.
you have to be born with that talent-- like me
I mean, I like redheads and brunettes over blondes.
get a whip and some leather..

cuz there dangerous and they make us feel wild they intreega us and tempt us thats why
No girl wants someone who is fake.
Listen to Dr. Laura: stop being SELFISH and  stay together for the kids!
Its like, what are they for?
If he just wants to have sex then not long at all.
Who says you have to choose, LOL  just kidding.
i've had 6 surgeries in 2 year.
YOUR HUSBAND IS CHEATING OR ON THE VERGE OF IT.
yah sure e-mail me at: down4anythinguwant@yahoo.com or misslovable36@hotmail.com
no use to sigh for that one.
i've tried that one and you can't force yourself to like someone.
Well, for one thing maybe they are good friends and the hot girl really likes her friend.
that means he kept the law right to the dot and comma.
lol ;-)  Do you plan to get married and can't decide which?
maybe because they think since they known each other 4 a while they think that they r pretty
I have more feelings for my ex (obviously) and i want him more.
always have GOD in your life always things turn out better that way.
Don't know what a troll is, don't really care.
Just be yourself and the rest will follow....
When you are taller then the C.N tower!
yes i know a boy would date ur avatar
!grl, u shoulden't be with a guy who has THREE luvers.
if your not a very attractive guy it really helps to be funny.
anytime after major holidays so you wont have to buy anything for her!!!!!!!!!!
Go out with your girlfriends and have a blast.
her personality and her eyes and lips
emailme and tell me if it worked.
my bf has one in his pool house and we fool around in there all the time
just say the truth and choose one stuck with her  and don't live a double life like this .
By the way, you are a JERK!!
that has happen to me before!
12 years old is still pretty young..you dont need boyfriend.
Don't try too hard, just be yourself.
If the age thing bothers you, then don't do it.
& not because you want to cheat him, but if you crave for physical relation with other man
I THINK YOU NEED TO GO OUT WITH A GUY LIKE ME .
Now he wants to get married and I love him so much.Should I trust him.
also, do you know any cute names for babies?
just tell him he will be a dad no cutecies
give it atry, but try not to get your hopes up.good luck:)
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET OUT OF THIS DEBT(WHICH WE ARE SLOWLY DOING)!
he obviously loves his wife and has no plans to leave her.
THE BETTER WE FEEL, THE MORE WE'RE LOVING IT!
I myself dont like to chat, cuz Id rather get down to busness.
give him space and see what comes out of it.
IF YOUR GONNA CHEAT JUST END THE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE ITS WILL NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER.
lots of sex good head and no bitching
No, you just use what you have, some guys like small boobs.
nothin is happening between us anymore but i think its cuz were both shy...im so confused.............
probably she needs a bf !
It would'nt be fair to the new guy if you still want to be with your ex...
try to make him notice you and then let destiny decide!
b'cos women r never satisfied, never trust worthy and never accept the truth
Just don't LIE this will only make it worse.
Oh yeah, and take out their garbage!
Trust me, your faithful uber wise
just go 4 it, try not 2 get too attatched though
if she says no, don't get discouraged, just try again.
until you have fulfilled your career goals .
maybe its the best thing you have to offer
use a lolipop to practice on.
well if ur bf iis married then let them be honey!!!
Is it that i dont mean enough to him and he's not afraid to lose me?
MY BOYFRIEND WAS ON THE SAME THING AND I NEVER KNEW FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS.
They are a lot of fun.
they find their gf or wife whenever she is good in sex (cute face and perfect body) !!!!!!
but since you and the girl are friends...maybe she'll understand what you feel.
DOnt u have some hw to do.
ya im thirteen beu_ford_123@yahoo.com she just wants to talk to people so s/u yall!
If you know him well enough you know what he likes.
if youre gettin your d!ck wet thru the mail then yes.
IT MAY OR MOSTLY NOT LEAD TO LOVE
a magical sentence you can tell him :  don't worry too much, easy, man
sledding, horse back ridding and even visiting the local shooting range.
But he one thing you have to be careful of is to not send the message wrong.
it goes on the left hand next to the pinkey
but don't forget to tell him your problem.
Because women want what they don't have and can't have.
I think it should be HEY HOW ARE YOU?
if u r in love donot deny it and work hard on ur studies too.
hot guys can get away with that, so they do it.
If ur having problems and u two aren't patient, kind, understanding w/ each other than ur not in luv.
because u r still unmarriaged (just kiding)
SO EVERYONES HAPPY AND LOVING IT!!
its the present and future, not the past
some girls like going faster/slower than others.
Talk to her about it first unless you don't care
A Day he will never forget, of course after long hug and kisses
Write him a letter and expain that you DO NOT want him to cantact you again in ANY WAY.
I dont get why anyone would find that attractive.
My surest test is to see who my family likes...if my family likes a guy (which they rarely do!)
Ah - now THAT's the question!
This is about the best fun ive had on the net
u have to decide whether you find ur friend or this guy more important to you.
And when i see her in school i get nervouse and feel like i am going to throw up.
Go out & have fun, learn about people...
he cheated on me right before he went in.
eventually your going to want do it but don't.
so that there is no way she doesn't know you are alive.
WAIT until you are BOTH in love or married...wait a minute... how old are you?
seems u ahve moved on already .....or have u ?
well it depends on how hot the person is
How old are you, if you don't mind me asking.
Just say hi and admit  you like her and get to know her.
Are you comfortable going out with her ?
is not a quote it is an acronym
Swiming has an 'm' where swinging has an 'ng'
in case you are opportunitiest wanted rich woman then must do little foxy works.
My answere is dont do anything to his wife you would not want her to do to you!
You need to run from her and don't look back!
Do you what to steer up desires that should not be there?
I took her out to dinner at an expensive restaurant (never did that before in my life),and a movie.
my yahoo messenger id is jemmie_2004.
Throw in a foot massage for fun.
dont be a pansy just go for it whats the worst that could happen
any bf who calls an old bf, is not worth giving a second thought too.
Just enjoy being a kid for right now, if you are young.
and take classes and make yourself busy busy .
This means the guy probably likes you too.
* a person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.
NOT ONLY SHOULD YOU GET IT BACK BUT YOU CAN SUE HER FOR THE RING BACK
I belive Shag & Velma are just 'friends with benefits' if you know what I mean.
OH, NO, WAIT, I TOTALLY DON'T.
if he's really your best friend u shouldnt be ashamed to tell him nething.
just say i nvr loved u
there is a delete for yahoo profiles,,have done it a few times,,,you must just be missing it somehow....good luck...
if she repeats the offense, dump her.
but really tho, the chat room is a place to go to escape, be someone your not.
If you want him back you better start talking..lol
Please have them be about love and romance... i need to post them somewhere!!
do you think he's being honest?
there's nothing wrong with liking another person...it's natural.
flip a coin or choose #3
Just keep your eyes open but go on with your life.
If your Mom says she doesnt trust you then SHE HAS NOT DONE HER JOB.
If it is for the love, then i do not see anything wrong.
who do u enjoy more and what will last longer?
go through the whole do you love me speech with him then decied if you should break up
they think he is ugly, but i don't.
(But they still can't baby talk)
i generaly last until i am done then i wait a few min.
find the one you could live with.but i say if he keeps cheating he's not going to stop.
Akward-fun ... is a hyphenated made-up word ok?
think deep .. and make up your mind  - things will not change you have to do this ...
I am one (well bisexual) lol
cause iif u do then this could turn out 2 b U-G-L-Y!!
C'mon it's her life, think of yours too.
i know we cant be graphic but go to an adult shop.
wow....it was in the movies....i was 15...wait i still am..hehe...ummm i dont think i want to explain it!
And women do it too, you know.
and has been cheating on her with three other girls
Get married is the only cure, you will never be lonely again, and you will be happy.
if she is your step cousin i think its ok.
Already married and she isn't / wasn't.
time after time it will stop
well if you don't like her like that, don't date her.
If he had the damn nerve to burn u with a cigarette, then sweetie move on.
First if she is holding her head high?
What I want you to do .
Then you should flirt with him.
The next thing is to sort of hang out with the guy.
Now I can go to sleep b/c you helped me to realize how unproductive i'm being.
as i know now, shangri la mactan has a location
For me I get alittle sad then I get really angry.
I don't know!...I just want the points...lol
I know it's hard but you're gonna continually ask what if?
I have fought so hard to get to where i am today and you guys helped me realize that.
But i think she loves me 2.
only if they are not both from the same school.
it kept him from coming to quick.
don't get married - - don't even be in a serious relationship with a girl.
I don't like 'bad boys'they're bad for a reason.
say you love her, be sweet, and when you have sex ask her what turn her on.......
Unless you don't mind sharing your husband, NO!
MY BOYFRIEND HAS CHEATED ON ME AND GOTTEN THIS OTHER GIRL PREGNANT, SO SHE SAYS, HE SAYS DIFFERENTLY.
Then say you want to see it too, but have no one to go with...
Chiquito, you need to grow up!
NO WERE GO GET A LIFE!!
my boyfriend does it all the time.
FOR REAL DONT TAKE THINGS TO SERIUS.
or in other word: what the girls like in guys..
contact me...with ur photo  bunjeez@yahoo.com  :) i'm single too
dont believe porno mags and porno films!
if it wasn't love then it wouldn't hurt.
Anybody can truly be in love, no matter how old or young they are.
I mean I LOVE my girlfriend, so therefore I am in love with her.
if your time is more occupied then you won't feel so left out.
You are playing with fire and you know it man!
All the girlfriend is going to do is waste your time and money .
If you need yo ask...the answer is NO!
Give her a new gift and then introduce her to a new bait, person!
Specially if its a wife receiving her loving husband
tell her how you feel and ask her nicely.
the sounds you make, and the way it feels, and the smell of it.
If you are around the Okefenokee Swamp then let me hear from ya!
because there a very few of them left
Be good to yourself, you deserve it!
Kiss her neck and suck on her breast.
These are just some signs that will help you I hope............Good luck.
just be yourself and talk about everything u can...from religion, to family, to the future.
ir its the right guy, you will know.
Probably few days later you could tell her .. and she wold understand.
I have a rule: I don't need who don't need me
But you have to get your life back anyway.
it's bad enough already dont make it any worse.
We are both bi and so I never have a problem meeting new guys (or girls).
say yes.. unless i already liked someone else..
a great smile, that's the hook.
u no, dont sweat the guy stuff.
Do you really wanna be a homewrecker?
there is this girl i am madly in love with and i need help.
well it's up to u, but if i was u i will certainly wait.
does it help to have better sex
it is very easy trust me you just have to use your charm and it is all you need.
Tell her why you miss her.
take your time, do not hurry.
if you love him you can forgive him .but that don't mean you forget
i wouldn't say i think sex is and it's not at the same time
yes  why not give her some fun
GOOD LUCK FRIENDS ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO SLEEP TOGETHER.
i dont really know but i think i heard somewhere it was like 6 1/2
but never be a stalker thats out!
I hope I marry someone like you!!
would you go out with me
yeap i have a super duper hot cool boy friend .LOL!!
but still, it's up to you.
And found out it can be nice!
(i can't stop crying) i need help.
easy edit ur profile then a screen pops and shows ur profiles.
ITS NOT OFFICE ROMANCE, ITS SEX FOR MONEY!
i think u should wait til u get married because who is to say it will workout.
DONT LET HIM SO SHIT TO YOU OK. that is not love.
well the difference between love and inlove is very small: i and n
and start again after that i can keep on going until i am finished
But mostly because their scum and deserve to die in the fire of hell with cacti up their butts.
If a guy (or a girl .
my best friend is getting married next week...me confused what to gift him...plz help me friends....thanks anyways
FOR MY OWN OPINION, I'D RATHER CHOOSE MY BESTFRIEND THAN THIS GUY.
Hope this has been helpful  Good Luck
no it is about the same.
A girl is not about her boobs.
or a long weekend to paradise.
he should only have u. hope this helps ya!
plus you will be doing your bro a favor because she is obviously gonna hurt him more one day.
maybe you should try to be more open.
If you know the Lord then you know what love really is.
ive given sex so well that it made her cry if that counts
But I guess you are either really young, or... kinda in the middle age.
...I'm really just searching for the other side of the coin here, if it exists at all.
that eventually may lead to your spermcannon rotting off
Once a cheater always a cheater.
this guy i like said he knows what im hinting what dose that meen ???
Guys love chest and ass so if u got ass then don't worry.
dON'T WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE WITH THIS MAN UNLESS HE IS TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU.
or ever a friendship with no trust?
Don't care much for R&B and have no use, whatsoever, for hip-hop or rap!
if she says shes changed, believe it, but dont be stupid.
YOU ARE TO YOUNG TO KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF FALLING IN LOVE OR TO ACT ON SUCH AN  EMOTION.
Sometimes you just have to ask them yourself though.
to quote an old commercial: what happens next is up to you!
No girl if your hot then hell never dump you!!
When the DJ asked for her husband she hands the phone over saying Here Baby.
Screw what these other people are sayin , Get that ring back!
ITS BEEN OVER A YEAR NOW AND HE IS DRUG FREE.
OH YES......  AND WHAT A GREAT FEELING IT IS !
then I know he's got something on the competition:-) Good luck...
Well im kinda fine since i've been up for 2 days already answering question...
U need to spice it up a bit, are you always doing the same exact thing?
WHY CAN WE NOT JUST HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
But, don't you deserve better then a guy who isn't willing to offer a commentment?
well u have probably been banned or it may be ur age.
if she is really gonna kill herself then why would you be with someone who is like that?
Right always comes when you least expect him to come
Lots of so called bad boys are actually nice guys putting on an act to get the girl.
whipped cream and cherries :) a simple girlfriend sunday mmmmm
he acts like he hates me.
and when you make serious mad money .
because most pretty chicks are vain and they need reasurance that they are pretty
because guys are all gay and only want one thing
But I mean, don't worry about her.
are you willing to wait that long?
do all of the above or just a few of them and you will be a-ok!
Everytime she says I love you, I love it!
i have 2 kids as well and was addicted to meth for 3 years.
be around people who care about you stop lying
because if u want fun then yea but if u want a serious relationship then get to know him.
But dont be really pushy after you kiss her ok cause SOME girls dont like that!
just sex & sex & sex until morning !!
in the caribbean and the Bahamas u will love the sun sand and sea and r beautiful island
Some girls go to the 'bad Boy's' becuase there are so many around.
it changes people to people for me western girls rocks
old is too old for diapers.
amazing guy vs. i want him more.
Otherwise relax and take it easy !!
because all guys are complete jerks.
just tell him boy  dustin girl  meagen,caroline
if you truly love each other than age is not an issue.
dress nicely good personality good looking
WEAR OPEN TOE SHOES WITH BUSTED UP FEET KNOW YOUR FEET ARE CUTE DONT THINK!
find out if he still likes you then mabe go for it it worth a try
No cause i just dumped him cause he was a asshole
16 is way too early for that promise.
how do you end up being in love with 4 women?
Dump his ass till he does what he promised.
I do this every chance I get!
oh, and that never hurts either.
Do what's best for you, always girl.
lots of time and other people
Maybe you are just having a boss thing.
maybe hes not sure u like him
no, y r u a serial cheater lookin for love
but if you want to move on, then its your choice.
same pasition im in... never say the 2 evil words though... just friends... they will both leave you
Leave it alone and get on with life.
in his/her arm, no matter where you are.
And some people, men and women, once a cheater, always a cheater!
yes small women are very attractive
I f*cked my brother's b*tch last week.
You dont forget about someone you love.
well my mom left my dad when i was young he was an alcoholic and all that fun stuff.
walk around naked, and tell me when and where you do.
my boyfriend lied to me..and guys r stubborn.. cuz men r babies!lol.
answers, thats not wat its here for.
yea my best friend it in love and shes 15
The hottest chic at the gym may not be available, but she MAY have a sister or friend...!
B e honest and truthful to her...
Does that mean she does not want to change??
I don't really need or want one but I just really want more people
I don't believe in putting myself out there.
AND NOW I AM GLAD I HAVE STAYED.
Normally, I would just say she needs to stand up to her dad but SHE IS 16 YEARS OLD.
I wouldn't go so far as to say once a cheater always a cheater.
(use your own way, not someone elses.
she actually gave you the real number????
Now where is that kind of a girl, haha?
how well do you know your current boyfriend??
YEAH LIKE BIG DOG SAID IT IS UP TO YOU.
You must talk to him now about this situation, if he still hits you, get out now!!!
i had similar experience last summer.
alot but most of the time there not smiling at my face but another body part
Act like its no big deal.
when there is a great love between a husband and a wife!
ur not stupid..it's natural 2 have that emotional attachment because both of u shared your deepest feelings.
i know my boyfriend & me have fun trying different types of condoms.
do you know if he has feelings for you and if he does are the same.
Am I too sensitive or he's just not right for me?
At youth group this girl is always flirting.
30 - 40 years from now it should taper off.
i personal say wait till after it will be worth it, but then i didn't and regreted it later.
well...i hope it turns out ok. Whatever u do, don't send him an anonymous note.
KEEP THE ROMANCE IN THE RELATIONSHIP, FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, OR NOT.
But i do want to have my chance....or maybe i should jsut wait?...idk....
Why not invite him to come on some group outing?
That is the biggest bunch of crap I've ever heard.
im only kiddin they shouldnt use any...just be a gentalman and not rude
And stop having sex to GET someone to like you
AND WHEN YOU DO FIND A MAN HAVE ONLY SAFE SEX.
c i would like to go w/ u
because she's not faithful to her man... or vice-versa..
well im no expert at this but i have loved a boy before.
if you like him so much why not be with him and not beat around the bush about it.
u've been hurt and u wanna get them b4 they get u
yeah baby, leave his behind and get with a real man who knows he likes women
no not at all is wut i would think but dependin on tha person she just mite.
i went with the friend and we tried the relationship thing.
U can FEEL the GREAT TASTE of TO BE LOVING after thinking like his ways.
u can tell me what u want me to know
u should have sex when u think that your ready for it
IF U CAN'T STOP THINKIN OF HIM.
What if he went for her and not you.
I know just what you mean.
so that you break into pieces
Your still young don't rush things.
if your bf is smoking leave him.
a sex with someone you love that know how to do it
In about a week I can relize I'm in love
My ex did - then again thats why she is my ex now.
I HAVE NEVER KISSED A BOY!
SHOW ME YOUR PIC AND TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS AND ...I'LL LET YOU KNOW...
ITS MORE OF A HIGH SCHOOL THING.
most of the time she tells she just loves to see me.she feels happy when i visit her.
But you're not sure if you should ask her out?
Just walk up and start talking.
U never know what else he's hiding from you.
Why would you want 2nd hand garbage?
i think u should go for it.
Nope... We have nothing else to do.
if he's not interested than he will say so.
anyway do you and you will be ok!!
Though in my case it was love at first type ;-)
Live your life, and have fun.
Not married but di have the kids tho.
You can't MAKE anybody do anything that they don't want to.
Its best when u get a Nut quite honestly!!
my boyfriend and i have been together for over 5 years.
depends on how old the woman is herself.
start it with things i want to talk about.
that's a tough one isn't it?
Firstly, i am a girl so u can trust me.
he might be from the other realm....aw shucks dis means im stupid, oh brother.
even i think bout it sometimes.
In my opinion it first has to be with someone you know!!
who do you think about before u go to sleep?
there is only lust or crush at first sight.
Wait till a girl finds you.
The tempation was so great that he just kept going back on the net.
Give him an ultimatum (which rarely works) or leave him.
Ya know, guys think a like so your'e not alone.
but adding the blonde and hot just makes it even better
Dont worry not all men are like this.
thanks for amswering my question earlier.
i like you brother wonmen will never undersand becasue they are differnet than men.
And if you really really like him...fight for him.
HOW IMPORTANT YOU THINK ABOUT THEM ALWAYS,LOVE THEM AND PROMISES THAT YOUR LOVE IS ETERNAL
Why don't you go ask your mom
And yeah, you do sound like an alright person!
Then you get the hell on.
a guy who can dress and knows how to treat a woman!
;) Oh, and put me on your buddy list so I can stalk you sometime...  lol
If you TRUST him then dont worry about it...
my boyfriend who is in the army.
i dont have gf but i used to have 8 .want to get together???
she obviously has someone else or she just has cold feet.
If he is such a great guy why don't you hook him up with some of your friends.
Chatting dirty is just like watching porn.
MAYBE THEIR NOT YOUR REAL FRIENDS!
If you are talking about smoking it...then no.
If not, let go of it.
well,give each other a chance and dont put your heart in 100% first.
go outside and you will see one i am sure
i met this lovely man from africa and im trying to get him here with me .
SO NO, YOU WILL ONLY HAVE MORE PROBLEMS BY TRYING TO KEEP IT GOING.
Hey, If they can get away with it then more power to em.
i go with this boy but i f'ed up when i told him about my friends busness.
some things once done cannot be undone, dont regret ur actions.
some time i would go for a bad guy, because they make you feel bad and i'm a girl
Oh yeah,ALL sites & talk lines are FREE to woman.JUST PICK ONE OR BETTER YET ,...JOIN THEM ALL!!!!
is because you are waiting that he ask you as formal girlfriend
HEY ONLY WOMEN JUDGE OTHER WOMEN FOR SLEEPING AROUND ALOT.
If you think he likes you, then your probably right.
for example if you didnt go out dancing then well start now
Eres la mas preciosa mujer en todo el mundo
How can I for sure tell?
THEN ASK HIM OUT IF HES SINGLE!!
Possible divorce w/minor kids...home w/mortgage...spouse will fight...
you should be honest, honesty is very important.
im just so confused right now.
Any girl who doesn't know shouldn't be flirted with
Im not  big flirt, but i want a chance with some nice guys.
My uncle has called me beautiful... so that doesnt really count.
yes what were you thinking  o my god
nobody can't force you in what you don't want to do... HAve fun.
And as the song says It's in his kiss!!
But you do sound attractive !
glad force flex lol good name for a hat
I would play hard to get.
If you're asking, then it's probably not love.
if u are not satisfied in the bedroom it is ur own fault!
I want to have someone that likes me, best.
Don't lose your temper, and don't get drunk.
if u like him and he trully loves u. go for it.
I'm still with her, we're gonna get married sometime... How awesome is that?
sometimes but who likes to do it in the grass.
Buzz me if you want, single as a saint here..  same Yahoo ID.
I had my first love (was it?)
!,,,,its one of the foundation of the relationship !!!
to be loved and not cheated on
how many guys do that and why?
below 21 and you should get married FIRST
yes, i know her....man she is hot....
tell him you gotta do whats best for you that its just not clickin anymore.
make a special bond between the two of you.
ABSOLUTELY .... NOT.... but most girls are not WISE....
you could at least give him a chance to explain,or defend his self
just try to savor each that you guys spend with each other.
You're always doing this to me!
may be you are not yet ready for commitment
Yes, all girls....still get along and happy....
Japanese, eating with sticks is fun.
and make it a point to show her how much you do.
****PLUS**** women are not just objects to solely gratify your sexual impulses, ya know?
it would just be... unexpected, unwarranted, unwanted even...
go for it.if you like nothing should hold you back.ADVICE JUST DONT GET ON HER BROS BAD SIDE
hang out with them without M around.
At a movie when the movie is over!
ok but we don't even date again yet.
Depends if she a good girl or a freaky girl.
and no 28 is not to late.
Or, if you want a little less stressful way.
ok but we don't even date again yet.
We BOTH like it better that way..
Depends if she a good girl or a freaky girl.
and no 28 is not to late.
Or, if you want a little less stressful way.
over all, you just should be the one to call him.
Theirs lots of boy's so don't sweat the small stuff.
Maybe not being a big talker is a good thing.
DO NOT repeat DO NOT PICK UP STRIPPERS!!!!
Love ya, i hope i helped.
Just go up to him and say Hi.
but never get her a crapy gift like face wash lol
If something ever romantic happens, kiss him on the cheek...then it'll happen (the real one)
Money is not every thang to girls.
normally people arnt so good in a relationship when they have the same sign try a tarrus
especially if it came with some communication.
Gul, you gone get a whoopin!!
my girlfriend doing me a massage
you cant get dallas into anything but video games lol sorry aarons the same way
Nope, not in love at all.
Words mean nothing, if you u think about it, words only create deseption.
but if he likes her better, and she likes him, then you are out of luck.
try to sneek aroud and find out the truth dont get cought
I have the same problem but it is the other way around!
im not really sure but maybe she misses you... but dude dont expect anything...
or you could simply walk outside down the street and she could be right there waiting for you!
thanks and welcome to yahoo answers!
(nobody wants to romance a cactus) Good luck!
If you like eachother and have a level of comunication, it's ok!
thats the only real question you need to start with
yes if you like the boy
I did hit him and just looked at her and then just left taking my girls with me.
Another reason is (I don't do this myself, but have a guy roommate who does.)
Just move on- you can do so much better!!
Im 25, my ex is 28 and the other guy is 22.
therefore, we hear a lot of lies!
and you would not trust him.
You just have to feel it.
Cuz I can sure see myself in your pants!
Nice guys don't get laid - thay can maximally become a friend.
find some thing new and different.
the best way is to learn how to flirt and becoming a charming person.
Now I guess it is time to say GO SEATLE!
I tend to be shy around people I just met
You will only make your life with him like hell!
but we appreciate it anyway :)
A guy can only wait so long.
I knew he was a good man thats why I stuck around.
so i would say they are.
She don't know what she wants.
ITS SORRY TO SAY BUT I TRIED IT ONCE MYSELF, 10 YEARS AFTER WE FIRST BROKE UP.
but anyhow the relationship got worst around the middle of our 2 year together.
if you have a bf, he should be the only one you like in that way.
What's going to happen when you end up pregnant again??
Their are guys (like me) who think about it daily and thats nature for guys.
no matter what u do or say  nuthing will change her mind
chocalates and flowers but if you want expensive go with jewlry
If he is a friend be real with him only if you DO NOT VALUE your friendship.
You still want to be friends with the other guy.
I don't think my ex husband ever said he loved me.
Don't rely on pickup lines to pick up girls.
U cant forget ur X..never   Bcoz u r made of XY.....Mind it.
i'm not white but i'm a freak.and can make u love what u get.!!!!!!!!!!!!
maybe your wife encouraged them to see if you would act on it.
BECAUSE YOU DNT BELIVE THE ONES THAT SAY THERE A GOOD MAN.
you should ask her out if she likes you and you like her.
but most women do date older men it feels weird dating them younger!!!
OBVIOUS: He looks at you a lot.
she is twenty years of age
Just write her again, if you still want to, that is.
learn how to give great head.
yes girls want the titanic not a little sail boat
If you don't, or he says what was that for?
go back to the drawing of dating, write a love letter to her and mail it to her.
LOL...That is the funniest thing I've read in a while.
just say it,don't think too much about it.you'll fell better after that and maybe you'll do even more
Not real until they prove it!
And then it's a lot of taking and little giving.
if she doesnt call or answer, then move on, she's not worth ur time
Tell ur friend to think about that.
No no no.. it's a great idea!
No who would want to be ur gurl friend?
Don't wait for a guy who won't commit.
you are a ass if you can just do that to someone
Im married and I go into chat rooms with other women.
You won't so give it up.
Myself, i'd never cheat my girlfriend/women.
it is really hard to get over someone that you love
it sounds like he likes you alot and you need to grab him befor its too late
she has just me in her life.
let him know in a NICE way
if your gonna hit a man you better be willing to take it.
Remember:  Be careful what you ask for, as you just might get it (D&D axiom).
Don't be afraid of women just be yourself and she will love that more than ANYTHING!
Get to know him well, if he ditches you then you'll know.
after all it takes two to be a couple... but one to break it off...
i dont care what you think about him i like him and it is not your chioce...
But it didn't work to well considering that I still like him.
ITS IMPOSSIBLE,IF HE DOESNT WANNA TALK TO U AT ALL, THEN ITS OVA FOR GOOD!!!!
let him go no calls, nothing .
Mostly because in chat rooms the people don't have to see who they are insulting.
Hello, I know exactly how u feel!
Ask someone in your neighbourhood .... HOW CAN I VISIT YOU FROM SINGAPORE????
get out there and meet people ..have fun
I was just wondering how guys think of women  for example: their favorite things about girls  (besides BREASTS!!)
That would be a good clue if you don't have one!
No, it just means your ex-friend is being nosy.
you shoulda just said cya; if he really believed that.
if some guys don't look for these they are not worth it.
I personally liked it a lot.
Get a gf... duh problem works it's self out
coz it is within...the only reason y ppl live is love
So, Whens the lawn getting mowed?
have you ever done it behind has back?
because they are immature and stupid
Guys just think they can get away with it.
and eye contact... its all mind games.
But then they might not do it because we women are like elephants and never forget!
you dress like a hooker and stand on the street corner!
He might be worrying about the same thing!
tigress refuses sex right after first experiance with a tiger.
Hey gal, its da guy wit da ( are there any single michigan gals/women lookin for a date?)
id have to say get out and meet some men in your area
that way no feelings get hurt if your carful
he cheated on me now every time we sleep together I think about that, thats pretty unattractive
So easy to answer so thanks for the two points.
Is he trying to avoid u?
depending on the type of grass.
and also think of that girl she could be your daughter ;)  Good Luck
Then if something happends in ur realationship like say he cheats or somthing go out with ur friend.
A trip to either Las Vegas or New York would be really awesome!!
Your ex is the one who screwed it up for you guys.
2. but when a girl propose to a boy...boy always accept the offer..cuz 98% are sexaholic.
And what do guys like from girls.
If u ask at least u will know:)
because you can't find him reading this email!
How do go about dating my ex's co-worker?
He and I are pretty good friends and I've liked him since last semester.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YA'LL BUT I AM SRAIGHT SO, I WOULD PICK BRAD PITT.
it's fine ,,, why wouldn't she do that ?
WHO SAID THAT ALL MEN ARE SELF CENTERED.
no, thanks for reminding me :(
you can never tell what or how it is.
but you should still let her see him.

!If he loves you he will come back for u!!
Hey beautiful Whats your sign ?
if you are here then add me .... saleem_nawaz
I love my husband and he loves me!

THATS JUST PURE NASTYNESS AND SLACK.
My grandma always said two wrongs don't make a right.
BoooooooYaaaaaaH...  Well it's like this...  You hit him then he hit you back...
The third reason I probably wouldn't?
Don't date, that isn't what I mean.
and then try to talk to her.
Thats my opinion  Love ya   Caroline
have you done this behind his back?
Just be caring, happy, show how much you love the person the you are dating.
but never try to get mead at the if it is not called for
hook up with someone new and better
if that what makes you happy and him then go for it.
How does an 8 year old go about kissing a boys' thingi?

If a girl catches her guy cheating, she chould kick his a**.

he's already in my system, cant get him off my head.
u need to let her know something b4 she decides to move on.
Just choose the one you like most.
if u can sacrifice by ur family, ur job and ur life for her.
remember better or for worse, i do understand your not married to him.
they probably go to sleep cuz they have work in the morning
WHY DO YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE WITH ME?
it means that he is interested in you.
or why not ask him out and see what happens.
I really like a guy in one of my classes.
sorry,i think you blew it,,,,,,,,,,he will always remember what you did
Tell him to take a fyling leap at a rolling doughnut!
the guy maybe married and having an affair with you.
but i dont want to break up with him.
You don't need her and she only thinks she needs you.
not to get all religious- but I truly believe it
I don't man just fashion, a flashy car, etc.
wut he lieing bout, add details and ill add to my answer
Somemen like alot to hold on to.
IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH U LOVE HIM.

noone wants to lose a friend.
if he's abusing you, get out, at the very least.
I'm a girl and I don't care that much for money.
you obviously have an obsession with men who cheat... sorry
Should I tell him that I love him?
tell him to go to hell and kiss your a*ss on the way  he has not changed
He met A very sweet young Lady And She got Pregnant and The baby died from sids shortly after.
IT ONLY COUNTS IF YOUR MARRIED OTHER THAN THAT YOU CANT TRUST IT.
Ever since then I watch out for the hidden agenda's
Writing about your intention to do so on Yahoo!
Don't let it be about you.
Or should I give his co worker a chance?
Three Fwd Wishes: Grace => Mercy => Peace.
Ask her best friend or sister or mom.
In other words do not join in with him.
divorced so we could stop fighting.

a realization that they are better off and happier without you.
Men are funny in that way.
becaze your too young my dear.
I am not the one but you can talk to me... My id is astra1_v@yahoo.com
Cause i have had ppl like that...but then she took them from me, and now they are hers.
I find this statement somewhat odd and I am not sure exactly what you mean by it.
no you do not have to .
21 days now we are happly married  9 years and still in love
No wonder some people die single!
ask yourself if i were in his position would i have i've lied?
Tired of dating 4 now,cuz it all ends up d same way.
If someone else asks you out SAY YES!!
You'd know he's in love with you because he wouldn't be married.
i dont make him wear one ans then you wont have to woory about it
She knows I love her, I even made a website about her.
none they are all pathetic and gay
my X of today.. :( an i thought we were doing so good,
I sense much love in you!
Nothing beats lusting with your true love!
man fall in love with their eyes and woman fell in love with their ears
I want to see her movie.
it's better than women dating younger men
An honest guy, who don't have 10 girlfriends,and won't cheat on them.
move on and stop stalking him , its really not cool!
be trew to youself and your feelings
SO ITS HARD TO SAY BUT YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT AND YOU WOULD ONLY BE SELLING YOURSELF SHORT.
Don't do it in you parent's bed.
U don't think condom is best?
Let her know you think she is sweet!
get on with life and find something better.
maybe different foods will spice things up?
Let her fight for you for awhile!
Well thank G-d I don't have to worry about you screwing around and getting some girl knocked up.
But it does mean that he won't be dating ne one else either.
no but they like 2 b spelled correctly two
when he become poor and you still want him.
I always date nerds (they make great boyfriends) so gaming is something i'm used to putting up with.
ppl surprise the hell out of me.
I don't care how much older she is.
many still are and waiting for the mr.right to come for them.
uhhuh,WRONG,were'nt much of a friend were you?
if you are hiding things from your bf, then, yes you are cheating...deception is not a good thing
Should I tell him, and what should I tell him?
i think that if more people had confidence they wouldnt worry about what other people look like.
You usually dont see hot men for T.V.
Alot of these sound really fun.
You seem like a cool cat!
God will put you together if he wants it that way...Good Luck and God Belss!
YOU NEED TO HAVE A TALK TO SEE WHATS THE PROBLEM AND IF NOTHING GETS RESOLVE.
does he have a wierd last name?
Under 12 is just sick in anyway put.
Maybe she should just get busted for possesion
Here is a tip, who do you dream of?
That usually works for me (but I have my own questions to contend with :- } )
and your brother will always have to live with it, i say you should
between 15-18 and then wait to get married till late 20's and save urself for ur husband
DONT WANT TO END UP BEING STUCK WITH HERPIES THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
As The Same Way That You Find Me, Honny!
Besides, there are better guys out there.
), and know they won't get it from most girls that know they have a g/f!
it depends on how old u are
you might want to check out both of these sites.
feeling and he has been flirting or wanting to.
vanilla, fresh fig, musk, black cherry
Lust might be for fun but it is unfulfilling.
you are only a best gift for you bf
He may not like that, but at least you tried!
i've done different positions and places when having sex with my boyfriend.
i want to know fast cos im inquisitive.please send it fast to my email box
you will try to be happy!
If you can't have YOUR way with him, what????
people think it feels better, and it does, but the child support sure hurts more
But, if you don`t wanna wait anymore I`m here and I`m tired of waiting, its been too long.
u have to clarify issues with her.
if you are okay with it be careful
The guy that you have a lot in common with try to hang out with him too.
i agree, if she luvs u, then she shouldnt care.
just thought of it got my boyfriend horny.
Well, what I would do is just act like you don't know, or that you don't care.
you shouldn't let him cnotrol you.
BUT 2 WRONGS DONT MAKE A RIGHT!
Oh well, be honest with her and give it to her str8.
I only WILL date the ones who are mature and do not minupulate education!
remember, dont feel guilty or bad abt yourself, i believe you are a nice person.
you can get yor answer in his eyes and by his attitude!!!!!
Who knows you know what I mean?
if it is then she's the one.
Men get crankier as they get older too!
Are you fun to be with?
Show her how special she is and how much she means to you.
But ya can't live your life always wondering.
including me and all you readers.
He only admited to kissing guys.
its only outdated in hollywood and with lunatic liberals
(then giggle)  For the most part... men are idiots!
sounds like a weirdo to me, dump him
Hey silly... You hit him first!
!Tell them that you miss him so much that you will die without him!!
let him fix his life, you said he has gone a bit bad.
and dont give him any reminders about your old self
And remember this one:  Screw me once, your bad!
give him a kid if you dont already have one and if hes mentioned hes wanted one.
I just wonder if people ever do recover.
well if u were previously with her u should be able to talk to her.
Good Luck I hope you get the girl!
You can help it just dont do it...............
ummm... hon id tell her srry but that just wouldnt really work out
Kick her 2 the curb.Ur young youve got a lot of looking time ahead of u....
Or just  keep your maiden name
but they will do whatever they want because they never listen.
A guy just can't say 'no' to a naked chick!
you cant feel it at the moment.
close your eyes after you end the date.....and hold his hands
I do want to get ripped off.
Then call her up, and tell her that your gonna start seeing other girls.
this is a female talkin so i kno.
Are you a guy or girl child?
If you want him that bad.
im not pretty but the pretty ones, think they're all that.
well, if you think he likes you then maybe you should ask him out.
If any guy says otherwise, he's lying.
if they still dont leave give her your number and say something like call me when you have time.
even if it doesn't work, you will know; and never have to wonder, what if??
I want to forget all sad things and ... Really painful ... Any idea ??
some are good and have good things to say.
i know i did and still do.
Just pray and give it all to God...He can comfort you just give it all to the lord!!!
first of all, how sure are you that he is cheating on you??
if @ that time she still doesn't want to talk then its over.
Lmao and AGE IS A HELPER TO GRAVITY so EVERYTHING WILL JUST START TO HANG!
Had one before but she didn't like soccer, ended up in divorce...... single now
Who knows, maybe he likes u back
I asked her did she know anyone and of course she did.
I do a lot for my boyfriend and it's because I love him very much.
well tell about yourself... are u m or f, where you from and try a personals site
commericals do you, i hardly see any, not that i wanted to but you get the point.
its hard to just walk away i know it.
Save your life and don't get married at all!
i think he likes me cause he looks at me all the time!
She is always taking other girls guys.
I do... but I don't know the answer to your first ?
If it's one of his friends, and I find him cute.
If he loves you...he'll step up.
you cannot turn a straight guy gay anymore than you can turn a gay guy straight.
Hi, Why would you want someone who doesn't want you?
yahoo chat do u have yahoo messanger if u do emial me lil_ed_132002@yahoo.com we can commuticate
mmm i don'yt even no !
Start thinking about your new wife
But he doesnt want to 'hurt' me.
boy's toys..a laptop/PDA/some gizmo or sumthin..
I don't know!...I just want the points...lol
If there is no other way just talk to him
Ok, you probably love him because hes a good friend.
I am going to pray for you now!
Thats where the real beauty is
YEP, CAUSE A RELATIONSHIP SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON MATERIAL THINGS.
If I didn't like her or find her attractive, I wouldn't sleep with her once.
Watch a movie or play basketball.
Girl...you ever heard that saying that says Good things happen if you wait?
whos dan , why dont you ask him out again.. or appologize or whatevers needed
i really hope that no guys actually answer yes.
could you forgive them for anything?
What if you fall in love with the other person?
Be yourself don't be too nice(girls dont like realy nice guys)
he might think you like him more and he can not reciprocate
Start wooing her all over again.
Just a bunch of poor people without A/C so who cares?
yes they do they think their all that
So just wait 4 a time when u can talk with him alone and see what happens.
But I wouldn't marry a woman who wouldn't take my name.
OK I dont care who likes this!
LIKE THE FIRST GUY SAID-----DEPENDS FOR WHAT?
You are LITERALLY flirting with disaster.
Why would you want a man who's going to make you feel bad???
THATS LIKE SAYING ALL WOMEN ARE GOLD DIGGERS
my boyfriend plays alot of sports and never takes time off to spend time with me.
I had a best friend(whos a guy) that I knew for 4 years.
u go tell him directly coz no one dies from love,trust me
That your flirting with other men with the intention of replacing him with some one better.
yes i want to talk u and see u
I like him a lot, he is a good guy, but has been on dialysis for over 7 YEARS!!
My mom told me to call her when I found the woman of my dreams -- Horrible, I know.
I would have to say my biggest temptation is sex...
girl can be aluring but dangrous, i think
let the women decide that, i have a lovely hat myself..lolzzz
They're the only friends I have fun w/ so what should I do?
guys do all the time, part of being a guy I guess
You make it sound like she is going to mow you down!
if she doesnt want to do it, chances are she doesnt want to know!
cuz nobody wants to let the candy go out of hand.
you don't want your anniversary to be an anxious day.
but if not maybe his bored ask him what you can do to spice things up a little
nope y r u looking for a virgin companion or something?
I want to still be friends so I need to say no nicely.
cuz nobody wants to let the candy go out of hand.
you don't want your anniversary to be an anxious day.
i mean everyone likes getting presents sometimes and stuff, but there are so many more important things.
9 months it has lasted 22 years
(or something like it).... you can always say you were 'just curious'.
Or am I just plain and simple got the hots for him!
And by all means..........don't be afraid to tell him.
Last I heard F O R D was taking the plunge in Canadah.
no, but better have some if you plan on going on dates
i don't think this is even a question.
umm that was kind of on the wierd side u should of jus talked to him up front
Just dumb people do ignorant things like that (retarted)
It depends on what type or girl you like.
do you think it is neccessary?
Just do it as often as you can and when you can't then you have your hands Don't you?
One thing was on my mind> to get back at my -ex.
if you hit like a man take it like a man, but if you leave thats your decision.
how do you know when a man loves you!
and if i could be real, how can i get this website?
PURE LOVE IS WITHIN..WE SHOULD ALL SEARCH OURSELVES A LITTLE DEEPER TO GRASP IT
so na he say dat he cant trust me enuff to tell me how he feel.
He knows, but cant accept that Im gay..............
Dump him you dont want it happening again.
I want to be happy all the time ...
well you might just want to tell your mom cause your dad might try to kill you .trust me
its the flesh demanding and the satan insisting, if u r married go for it.
im sorry :)  but i hope this help :)
Theres this guy in my youth group that I REALY totally like alot.Were both 14.
But if you were just talking, hay it sometimes happens.
yeah it does but it depends on the size of the guy.
But dont be to pushy when you call her cause girls dont like pushy guys!
well the older he gets the less things you are gonna do.
Go out looking and have fun with friends she will come eventually.
You guys gotta spice up a bit.
Hey, girl, I like your avatar's choice of hats.
Please give me some advice about what guys do to girls they like or don't like.
What if someone waits until after they're married, and then finds out that their partner sucks?
who do u think about when u wake up??
2 out of 5 American teens have an STI
does he love you or is he in love with you?
i mean, like do wutever u think will feel good.
anyways just keep your eyes open and keep a close watch on him... good luck
tough stuff for someone who's just starting to mature.
The best way is to not do it at all!
Do' they ever later on feel bad for being a jerk?
They give you a whole lotta room for more lovin'!
go for it man, its not like ull be cheating on him or anything, u guys arent together!
Well, he pays attention to you in ways that other guys don't.
well how about joiing the army, get stationed there and hang around the german clubs?
how sure are you that you had the best sex on earth???
its not gonna hurt anyone right now.. later it may b a prob!
i like a guy from a different state how can i ask him out w/out asking him?
If she is telling you  You are everything to me  DUMP HER!
youre going out with him and not your friends.
do you cheat on ppl?- im just kidding.
Because you're scared and you have unresolved issues...
Tell her to KICK HIS ASS!!!!!!
as long as u arent together u can do whatever u please.
I have dated a younger guy before and its nothing wrong w/ it.
I THINK YUOU ARE A HOTIE/W A BODY HUN!!!!
i am a male and i admit when i`m wrong.what?
wel make ur friend feel as if life without that creep is more fun.
:) Nothing like sex after marriage *grins*
take a deep breathe and just be yourself
it's hard to do, but it's definately worth it to have such a good friend!
i am a male and i admit when i`m wrong.what?
:) Nothing like sex after marriage *grins*
take a deep breathe and just be yourself
Someday they'll be fat, old and wrinkly and you'll be like...OMG!
are you looking for somone who strips furniture or foundations
Maybe play w/your hair a little bit.
PEOPLE STAY TOGETHER (or come back together) BECUASE THEY FORGIVE NOT BECAUSE THEY FORGET.

That's...well...what sex was before the media started messing with it.
...and if he thinks your a moron for that, you're wasting your time.
IM NOT IN OLVE OR OLIVE WITH HIM AS U PUT IT ..BUT I AM IN LOVE WITH HIM
i think its worth it !
i think u should try it out as a friend and see where it goes from there
My hubby is like that and so are most of the guys he works with.
hi.. im 22 years old.. just broke up with my boyfriend .. im single and very much available..Ü
if you love one another youll work thngs out
but i still luv u as a friend(thats to the person)
(do you know how to read the conversation after he is done chatting with these girls?
dont think that hun its not true
i don't know what else srry
Even if they won't admit it to there friends.
i tried to let go but didnt work i am so in love with her.
Go out with him if you like him.
Can I be his friend?...How did I tell him that I dont love him like b.f. and g.f.'s do?....HELP!!
If you want him you can have him and I hope you become good friends!
SEEMS LIKE MEN ARE LOOKING FOR $EX FRIENDS AND NOTHING MORE.
=)  But you are a liar.
becoz you cannot rise in love
Ya know, subtle hints...and lots of um.
But after a year I finally told her and I'm glad.
Have you done this behind his back with your girl friends?
Don't like my answer, don't read it.
And if that doesn't work, lay down the law and show her who's boss!
Until you find him though, have fun with as many men as you find attractive and fun!
he will come back but he might do it again
BE YOURSELF AND LOVE YOURSELF FIRST!
offer advice, tell her, subtly how u feel about her.
it still will not work.because mentally, you will alway remmber.
'motivate' him) without him realizing what you are doing?
there isn't any other way sorry
.Roomba...  On the other hand, he might really want something romaaaantic..... Nah, he wants something cool...
Its not really unethical ,just ...not ....should I say politically correct.
I really dont knwo what to do.
yes, but dont bite the tongue
Hot chicks LOVE nerds (cuz we can fix all the high tech stuff they use).
Some ppl are just bored, some ar ehorny, some just wanna have fun at some other ppl's horniness......
I'm probably not gonna make much sense with this.
First thing that will help...Put your shirt back on!
don't make anything that makes them turn off!!
stress can ruin everything if you let it controll you
LIFE IS TOO SHORT FOR THE BULLCRAP!
The man of my dreams thats out there somewhere.
u can do anything u want....you are your freedom
no, acually you are not stupid.
See what he thinks about you .
First its him just controlling you, next its him eating up on you.
I am 21 and i would say good looking.
do not do it run away PLEASE !
I know what it feels like to be cheated on and it SUCKS!!
Women let guys screw around with other girls.
Don't say stuff like, I want us to be close firends.. or anything like that.
by not comming on yahoo answers trying to ask how to impress a girl...
ima have to quate pac on this sex is best when its a fair exchange
also if the girl has a larger opening it wont be as bad.
Then just talk to him about what he likes!
Oh boy, if you don't know that I can't tell ya!
Notice things, tell her she is pretty...and be nice to her.
You just have to give it time.
...from someone who'll be very nice only while they need you more than you need them?
IT WILL HURT THA FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES FOR THAT MATTER!
only if you are having sex with your mother.
a lot of sex, then they pass to another chapter and then they want a true relationship and love
If you have a pleasure toy, USE IT!!!!
Or he will screw things up.
(do this during really scary parts.
My GirlFriend Ashley i love her alot i think of her everynight
JUST BECAUSE YOU COME ACROSS SOME WHO ARE SELF CENTERED DOESN'T MEAN ALL MEN ARE SELF CENTERED.
you could make love to a guy by just letting them know you really care about them.
but are you really for that.
I don't, why watch it when you can have the real deal?
Where does she like to go?
for the most part, do girls lie about love??
(all ok Mom, go for it)
Once, my sister gave a guy her cell phone number that she just met.
Do something to get her to come to you
then u should decide or at least it will make it easier to decide.
I honestly tried to stop liking him because no guy is worth loosing a friendship over, right?
I would ask myself though.........why can't he talk with me?
i would say prolly 16 and up just because anything younger is just a fling
Wait it out until you find the right girl.
Stick with this guy, he sounds nice.
But, my God, what a coach she was!
Have some fun and remember SAFE SEX!
Well kinda but not ya know read books and wears grandmas sweater.
im 15, i dont live there but i have been there before
Start naming names (ficticious) or something...
he makes you feel so speical and wanted.
Take a break from him - at least temporarily -
Try to step back and take a good look at this boy friend.
Give it a chance... Love takes a leap of faith sometimes...
some times like when it comes to looks .but no to eney thing eles
well it involved silly string.......we'll talk about that later.
tell her not too, they have no idea what they are doing  if you get my meaning
But if you are a very emtional person I dont reckamend it
i feel as though you just have not found that special someone whom you prefer to say ,i do.
you do not have if you do not like
if he does like her better, then he's not the guy for you, just go find another guy.
get ready to be severly disappointed!
or find something better so that your bf come from frist place to second place!
just the snobby,thinks their better than everyone else ones
and someone cool to hang with and be around.
Unless of course you are very good looking and have lot's of money too.
We wre good bed partners but not good lovers
But once a cheater-always a cheater.
you give your girlfriend a box of candy, a card, and flowers
tell your boyfriend that your child needs a family.
he said he still loved her but i dunno.
If you violate her trust and cheat...born again single.
since it's valentine's day, most restaraunts are going to be busy, florists will be backed up, etc.
I'll say it again, this was what I normally consider a good looking guy!
you have to ask him abt takin it a noch higher than where it already is ok mama.
OK, let me get this straight...he went was your boyfriend and then went out with your friend too?
I guess......Because they are really stuped and really anoying...DUH!!
Dont generalize it by saying an irish girl is a good wife, life don't work like that!
and like she keeps telling me that me and my boyfriend are on this supposedly called website.
he said he forgot about her but remembered her.
(we were dating at that time and now we've been married 16yrs)
if you give bomb head he will NEVER leave you.
I know i need to give her space and respect.
My eamil is Tad_22_98@yahoo.com or just IM me if you want on my Yahoo Messenger.
u can but now u can't by telling everyone in yahoo answer what u r doing
And guys make friends with girls in the hopes of potentially dating you.
Check out the book and read it with him.
most people don't care what race you r so they will just ask u
He'd want to move in & live there for free!
when it comes to looking for your one you have to pray
Only to loose  weight from the rest of your brain

IT DEPENDS ON WHO U RATHER B AROUND.
Also, if he asks you why...tell him!
next time he calls say hey, are you interested in more than a friendship?
I used to date a woman who thought it was OK for her to hit me.
and they wont give it to me either.
well, i do it, and it works on my sibs.. y?
Man up ask your crush out.
i thought i knew what you meant but now i don't.
which is kinda like a sickness that most men have.
how can i get him to change his mind?
just be your self and if he dosent notess you go up to him and start chating.
ITS NOT RIGHT TO HAVE SEX IN YOUR MOMS BEDROOM.
I had the same problem with one of my brother's fiance.
when u don't have to worry wether the condom is still in one piece or not.
the best way to do it is:...well actually it kinda sounds like you have the ego thing down already
so yiea, long story short, go for it!
i dont know how he feels and i cant talk to him .
from the main yahoo page, click on all y!
On the street, kiss, and hand in hand when not kissing.
because he is sweet nice hott he is everything i ever wanted.
call her again it shows your really interested.
not me.. y u askin any way?
First and foremost, take your cues from that someone special!!!
not really true.... love sometime can be saddening....
ever since the break up i havent seen him not crying
I HAVE DATED HERE AND THERE (NOTHING TOO SERIOUS) AND I AM READY FOR A RELATIONSHIP AGAIN.
get him a beer mug with urs and his picture on it.
very sorry i cant help you.
I think I'd be pretty leary about this unless you're just in it for the fun of it yourself.
because if she get mad .
My motto is Once a cheater, always a cheater!
!dont say something exactly like but something where it catches her of guard but isnt scary .why????
I'm in love with a crackhead.
Well I think you are having a problem in which most guys and girls have!
My question is this...I betrayed my best friend about 9 months ago.
He still walks by you a lot, though.
strip him naked talking dirty and stuff.
why don't you go the yahoo messenger, find the chatroom & wala!
(if you are a party guy)it all depends on what type you are.
can a man and woman who have been friends then cross the line, go back to being just friends?
show up at my door wearing nothing but a smile (with a six pack of beer in each hand)
either way take a chance and tell him something good can com out of it!!!!
otherwise try the german version of yahoo personals
The way they look in tight jeans and cowboy boots.
Say something to showyou aren't going out with someone because they look hot
I had to learn this the hard way!
If he was hot then Yeah!
So thats where I came into play.
but really - this is invading your marriage.
na...Because it will ruin your friendship!
you like jail time do ya buddy?
Then again I dont know much of what other guys do.
good luck and i wish u well.
Cuz then it will just mess up your life.
Well first off if he is acting like that then something is up.
Pick up lines are jokes and not used in real life.
********** is the best way to **********.
Ever since i was 2 my mom left me and my dad.
You are a young girl and you arent ready to go out.
What a girl wants is up to that girl and only her.
because sometimes people get mad at other people.
Or if you want to still get with him you need to.
My ex works with this guy I like.
And, if you have been doing that for awile, you won't be getting it up like you used to!
but advise: dont lose ur virginity if ur young or unless ur in love or engaged.
wow what a horrible place for you to  be put.
sure is...my husband and i have 4 kids...and met in an AOL chat room
no, it can go either way.
umm just ask whats the worst that can happen.
you would want to make sure you have the right mate
give ur contact email here and see to whom u want to tok.
I always thought it'd be fun to have a huge celebration for groundhogs day instead of valentines day
try to be friend with her , if you like ;)
DId you loved eachother at apoint?
I don't know what u should do now though.
ive seen a couple of your answers and you always seem to say it best !
think these guy have picted you up wrong lol 15 thats greedy lol
(wear something sexy for him now and then.)
go to myspace.com or enter a chat room on yahoo.com chat
Some guys are not big on the phone.
well personally i am in love with a brown, but i think some blondes are pretty.
say u g2g 2 a party that along relative is havin.
a smart and confident guy is a great turn on
As long as they r mature enuff to deal w/ someone older than them...then its all good.
make yourself busy, so you would have time tothink of somobody who's not thinking of you the same way.
i'm sure this is something any woman would like.
I'm friends with an ex that is married, and his wife hates it.
It sounds like you are just hurting.
what are you're plans if you ever got any?
everyone wants  a loyal bf/gf even though they might be flirtatious themselves.
anyways i hope i kinda answered your question without being stupid.
I know some really hott nerds.
yea its ok age aint nothing but a number girl go 4 it
We females like dogs, cats,cute and cuddly things, kids and some, mind you, like classic cars and motorcycles
Sh*t leave him alone and let me have a chance at ya.
But something inside said if I cared for my life at all, RUNAWAY!
if you slapped him first then he had every right to slap you back !
If she doesn't then at least you know and you can move on.
I don't know gurly, as they say once a cheater always a cheater.
on either your birthday or his/her
no its not cheatin...yall are just acting as friends...
Just be yourself and the right guy will pop up.
and most of the time, he would be the one calling me, just to say hi, and goodnight.
BUT I DONT KNOW THE ANSWER 2 THE OTHER 1!
But it definately depends on the difference!
what do guys want in women?
if she doesn't worth it then leave her at once.
Just can't seem to find the one.
listen dahling, it looks like your losing your mind over this guy!
and they want to look cool to there buddies.
Go from there....flowers & chocolate are always hits!
i wouldnt,  email me at sammy710@hotmail.com
just friends who've been through alot.
You're like a runaway train without brakes...you must be some kind of gossip queen huh??
I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF 1 HAVE BEEN SINGLE BY CHOICE FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS.
then why would you want him to change to a person he is not.
Some times girls don't want a pansy (although they won't admit it).
it's really up to you though.
sending her the poem will make her think u want her back.
Look,  If you really like this person,  just tell her.
I get about 7 to 12 a day!!
I don't think I want to know what your really trying to ask here.
then call when he gets home?
I know because i am their king!

And if she is like me, it doesn't have to be the $75.00 plus dozen roses!
i hope it works out for you.
What ever you do, do it out of love for your family.
your having a converstion or something and the wrong name comes out.
they are not computer addicts i get that from those type people
In plain language this means sex with someone you love is the best!
As the girl above said, its the other way around too.
now we can be friends again.
Or Maybe she see someone else.
it wasn't a very good kiss, but i didn't care he dumped me a week later!
Im a good girl, but im also a bad girl(if u know what i mean).
im single and all that i talk to cant be single or divorce.come on!!!!
somewhere around the time that puberty hit.
I THINK SO, BECAUSE THEY SHOULD NO YOU MORE.
And even nerds are hot too, you know that?
yes i do just enough to get a divorce from an abusive man.
And I came to realize that I made a mistake a little too late.
the way you move with him is ok up to now.
Everyone there thought it was the best wedding ever!
OK I am getting really friggin tired of this stupid question....
Or offering him a bl*w job if he ever needs one real bad.
I don't think his sister or mom likes me... and that's a problem too.
BREAk up wITH UR BF, AND GET TO KNOW THE CUTE ONE!!
Wow...that's a tough situation you're in!
If he wants to talk, why doesn't he sit down and talk with you, his wife?!
if u no how to kiss go for it.
agree with virgo 13 is good my answer when ur ready
they do not have any common friends and..... they are not happy.
Today it's all about the bling bling,then comes love!!!!!!!
ONLY MY OPINION, do what feels right for you though.
you are only going to ruin the friendship and then what.
JUST SIMPLY KICK HIS ASS AND TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL.
you know the look your husband might understand if you shared it with him?
If u're a guy then click on the question that says  Any cute 13 to 15 guys out there?
after my boyfriend and i did it things got awkward but now we're cool.
u are the man in the relationhip so make it known especially if u want her back.
Getting to merry the only woman you've ever kissed!
And Jesus Christ never said a WORD about sex before marriage, you ya can all clam up about that.
thx for answering my questions b4.
g-spot means a really sensitive spot in a womans vagina girls just love it
so there are women who hate sex.
But if they're popular then they probably do!
single, but hopefully not for too long
follow ur heart, it should lead u in the right direction
she needs u now more than ever.
It's pretty dumb if you ask me!
Once a liar, always a liar.
So no im not gonna say we do!
So basically it just to depends on the people that kind of thing is happening to.
Once a liar, always a liar
get ur own bed & house if ur going to have sex!!
take care of you!...in you soul lies a great power...!USE IT !
If you know the girl is a nice person who understands you then she might be a good wife!
cause everybody had experience on it....
BUT, I ONLY have sex with my wife.
he is FAG find a MAN
i mean youre not dating your jus talking or flirting so what's wrong with talking to other people?
a normal chick wont write u off if you tell her u like her.
ive only slept with 5 people that means im still a virgin right??
If your looking for a younger guy... let's say 19 Im the one.
girls break up with them because they're just too nice?
It's fun to watch, if it's not to anoying!
you gotta be a man first.
ask yourself, what do you like about the guy?
I WANTED THING'S TO SPICE UP AND TURN ON THE T.V.
Yes some are pretty and some are not...
i WAS going to go out with his best friend, but then i liked my ex again.
just tell her you want more, or ask her what she wants from u!
i had a crush on a guy from kindergarten to 9th grade.
well  u can talk to him ha ha ha not   spy an him i would
I would not have a problem with that
What kind of a man slaps woman... a wimp.
well u can try for his co-worker.
But keep it simple if you are just dating.
For a guy not to be all over her expecting kisses or sex!!!!
do what i cant read the last word?
I'am not ,thanx for the pionts level 3 here I come!
you only get to make decisions for you.
girls LOVE to hear they look nice or pretty.
Give him time to think meanwhile live your life and don't worry for him.
do u still thing of the 1 u thing ur in love with?
u need to go for it.that will be showin ur ex what hes gonna miss.
if he's being him true self and you're being your true self and you're drawn together still... that's love.
then try to attract him and make friendship with him.
DO IT IN YOUR OWN BEDROOM!
I hate it when guys try to buy me something or do it with out asking.
Would you or have you ever gone on GGW?
have the guts and tell him that or forever hold you peace!
my husband said i was cheating on him .
And she bugs the hell outta me.
i am young,19, and a gentleman lol.
BLACK, WHITE, GREEN, YELLOW, AS LONG AS HE IS GOOD TO ME...
Kinda shy about asking but really want see who else is looking for some fun.
That is why friends do stupid things.
I just feel that im alright looking.
Why did she get in that biz?
You find it easier to be friends with guys because other girls see you as competition.
do you think he really likes me??
Try to think about what you you did to get him and catch him.
besides, he cheated on u, and me?
if you are a younger person 3 days can be a problem for ya but normally no its not.
I have found what I think is the love of my life on line...
no they don't lie about love
he likes you alot, so how much u like him?
5 years - we are married for 15 years and still going strong!
i'm talking about 3-7 years different ... not a dady-like date :-D
that depends on what u think is messy?
and after i thought about it i was in my own way.
id like to watch that sort of stuff but I never have cos its too expensive.
Sit on his lap, steal kisses during some movie.
u live in california and u cant meet a girl shame on u thats what i can say
show him that ur over him, that u deserve better.
i would say yes...but im realy sensitive to stuff like that.
it does not matter how people look at you.
No way, that's how you get stds.
ya jerry is the best solution
Be yourself and don't worry about things so much.
when he doesnt have to ask
It isn't about what they 'like' it's about WHO they ARE.
and if he says yes jus tell him it's ova.
can you be like that with your boyfriend?
just be casual and dont move in too soon.
u said so urself, she's probably confused right now.
you have to tell them that their pretty,hot, or good lookin.
Well what ever you decide I hope it is the best.
no, i think they almost never lie us.
should i tell him i like him??
She'd been my friend for over 2 yrs and I finally told her I was in love with her.
i was at22 years when i kiss my lover libs
and yes i think it could be cheating.
never really no unless u ask-confront the situation which sounds very awkward!
you can join R J Kelly, Micheal Jackson in the kiddy molester hall of fame?
i search for long time yet no one accepts me iwanna real relaxation
I have to agree with Kittie~ Hell Yeah it's wrong!
I like my neighbor too...but take it slow.
its like not impposible but i dont know how !!!
the best thing i can say is pu--sy
cuzz remember jus bcuzz she luvs him duzzent meen he luvs her bck.
Bad boys are usually that... Bad.
So yes, women care about money.
he calls me at my phone....and at the dance he asked me to dance with him and i did!
Most guys that like you are obvious and will say so.. some guys will no be so obvious.
well when my husband stopped having sex with me he had another girlfriend!
But 2 wrongs don't make a right.
I START TALKIN 2 HIM AND GETIN CLOSER AS WE TALK IF IM FEELING IT
try and make up... it can be her v-day thing
you smile at him, and if he reacts, something's on.
but i would have to say it was perfect
go to a sex shop and get some sex toys.
He has no right to make any ultimatums...tell him to take a BIG FAT HIKE!!
Tell him and tell him good...  Drop hints and be extra hot Be yourself
Girl you gotta just take matters into your own hands!!!!!
If they say no, then they don't want to.
But he told you about so he obviously felt bad and regretted it, and u love him.
I actually got married right out of high school.
I did want to go out with him though.
time to stop being used as his play thing .. move on girlfriend
yes, i cant see anything wrong about that.
Maybe he is... and maybe he isn't.
and anyway, im not the person to ask im a virgin.
a woman who is nice and likes to laugh is a dead ringer.
Yeah, that might have something to do with it, huh?)
If he says yah, sure, then give it all you got.
No that definetely wouldn't work out
But, it just becasuse he stopeed attending church doesn't make him bad...Good Luck.
Are you old enough to have sex?, No I don't think so
For example if u wanted to ask him to the movies then you say: Hi (Name)!
what i hava to for make her to feel?
YOU MUST LIKE SLOPPY SECONDS,,,,,DUMP HIM , FIND REALITY,,,,QUICK
Don't focus on wanting something you can't have.
me but befor 17 years ago
all ppl should love you.and if they dont well they can bugger off.lol.
yes if hes nice and comforting and hot!
like if she could get pregnent or bad for the relationship.
Thats the way I see it anyway.
u should talk 2 her or give her a note.
i would like to know how.
should i keep talkin to her or just let go.
Oh my goodness your in for a fall big time.
good girls who are bad girls when the bedroom door is closed
he is your best friend, he knows you better than anyone, right?
i am head over heels in love with daniel radcliffe.
it depends on how old you are.
move on keep fishing unless you really like this girl give it one more try
thru a fren.. dats da mistake, boi.
honesty and trust.... 2 simple words but very hard to do.
if u're in love with her, the best thing you can do is be a friend to her.
ummm, have you tried to call him??
u should try having ur own man, theres more fulfilment in that than sneeking around with other peoples men.
but he has denied it and said it was his friend writing the emails.
If he called, would you just ignore hime?
Although the guy you think you are in love with, you probably aren't.
love is a pain full game  love is life
you've just got to watch out on which signals u might be sending these guys.
what do you mean by bad.
well i got mines at a school dance in the 6th grade
i know she likes me but she says she is in love with her ex.
be nice to her hang around her more if yall have classes together.
Ask him if he has ever considered fooling around with you.
we must let any girl to be a good mother
Don't assume every guy is like that.
ya , just need to be more sure of ur self
I do not want any more, but love the ones I have...
well u should ask god 4 help
If you have to ask, you probably aren't there yet - you'll know when you are!
AND IF YOU LIKE HIM THEN YOU SHOULD GO OUT WITH HIM.
lol  some people are talkers, some are listeners.
So finally I just told him.
so no its not right for him to be doing that.
take her out and get her some jewelry
my e-mail:fatthumb2000@yahoo.com and my yahoo id:fatthumb2000
Sometimes even the best of people are BLIND!!
Hot guy's knwo where to find the girls.
u should just tell them straight up but make sure u have a good reason y u want to
I do look for a response back and it seems like he does and scared to say it.
use your tongue and put in his or her mouth
If you lke my advice then take it if not follow your own way!
17 or 18... girls are mature enough to handle girl-meets-boy relationship at this age...believe me!
love means you don't have to fix yourself for them.
i always thought they do, if you keep in touch daily.
If ur eva on yahoo IM look up my id dave2_000
I wouldn't want to give my # out to someone I really didn't like
well its the pre-comitment phase ... so enjoy it man!!
the place might be boring but you might find friends there and you can hang out with them.
but you should never dwell on the past.
Definitely not legal...but hey, I could use the money.
You already have something in common and you have not even met her yet!
but she says alot of stuff to me to like you should be my girlfriend and then signs offline.
if you want the relationship to go anywhere you shouldn't be talking to other people.
Aren't you hating the orca callin' (female dog).
it will be very hard to get over the guy when you are still friends with him.
Oh and Drinking makes everyone horny!
u should not go out w/ him.
their spouse has an obligation to them, not the one theya re cheating with right?
Don't waste your time or other's
no bitching,is all i ask for.
Um yeah you should probably send him packing.
But sometimes girls are naive and well stupid.
depends if you really like the person and they like you back.
be yourself and spend time with guys not with your friends
there is nothing more to it, really!
no if he lied to you than no
and if she says yes you can go out and have fun.
no one likes to be lied to
If you think I should not tell me why not.
because women set their standards so high in a man
If you really love him then accept how he is because i don't think he would change.
is there a possible chance that it's a real website?
Give him a chance if he is giving you one...
is your feet tired cuz they been running through my mind alll day!
i wish u all the best!!
I get 5 maybe 6 each day
i love that a guy is asking this question, it is very easy to keep the romance alive.
i always thought it was kinda fun
so get ur own man dearie and stop decieving urself about the Angelina Jolie story.
love hurts and I will do it again
You just have to be yourself.
cuz of what other people told them
Usually guys that do that, would first go down on a guy before kissing on the lips.
Instead of focusing on being angry surprize HIM!
Alright here the info this girl asked for space Dec 22 and the space would start Dec 26.
you are looking for a bride, right?
if its more of his appearance, then its very probably infatuation.
Alright here the info this girl asked for space Dec 22 and the space would start Dec 26.
you are looking for a bride, right?
It is like saying  I love you while you are drunk........ it just doesn't count.
if its more of his appearance, then its very probably infatuation.
dont give up unless you know what you feel with the one your with now
Wow, where did you get a line like that?
take all planning into ur hands....HAVE FUN !
love is not having to say i am sorry - so the movie say.
If that isnt enough for this guy he wouldnt be worth your time anyway
IF U WORRIED ABOUT KEEPING THEN MAYBE UR NOT SUPPOSED 2 HAVE?
One way is to simply ask & take it from there.
the same reason women cheat... because their partners are not around
if you are not happy, then you should not be with him.
Cuz then if thats the case you gotta get yourself out there to get noticed... best of luck!
ANTI-OBVIOUS: He teases you about everything.
I know that it CAN and DOES pull many people in.
(But it has to be really good, expensive chocolate - not the cheap stuff!)
Remember TRUE LOVE is unconditional..................Like the love for a child or parent
It probably wasn't all that bad but remembering it now it seems like it was.
And no, I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn last night.
Size DOES matter... ask any honest woman, but you do not have to be King Kong (ask Naomi Watts).
u could tell him ur busy & if he asks say it's none of your business(nicely).
tell them she has a bigger penis than they do
The one that your in love with keep.
i just cant stand him having another girlfriend, but i dont think i like him.
dont use sex n your body for having fun !
but i also cant leave my girl as if i do leave her, she will have no1.
if you slapped him first you threw out all the stops first.
to think that sex gods would have a little respect for their parents bed damn it
sounds easy enough, but trust me, it's harder to find than you think.
cuz good people dont sit on the internet all night and argue with people.
If you don't want to be with him, just don't.
he knows i do but i do not know how he truely feels.
Ask your girl what type she likes...she will let you know...that will help make things easier for you
If u never think like that then u should not give him such lift.
If you love your boyfriend stay with him.
ive never met her, but weve spoken and shes on my mind alot.
I never thought of one before.
The key is to just hang in there and don't give up!
piledriver, on top, missionary, doggy style, holding her up, GO TO HELL...what ever you want
Everybody gets stung once in awhile though.
be very sure before you decide to spend your life with this guy.
unless of course, u have this idea of getting back?
tell her u love her buy her a rose do some thing u usually wont do
How do I motivate him or should I dump him...
Should I just break up with this weirdo or stick it out?
it depends it can b the drop of a pin or like 5 years ;)
I wanted it as much as he wanted it... and i had fun.
if i were a girl sure... but unfortunately i aint a girl....
if you are 18-21 you could find someone partying.
or  am i just blowin things outta proportion?
someone who listnes and who is nice and considerate and who is not overly jealouse and controling.
because once the challenge is over it isnt fun anymore
you have to test her with a friend of your
He is a good guy, nice, but has NO ambition, no LIFE!
Good luck and lot of patience.
Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
But if you like her, just tell her.
Did you do something to her?
Dont take your cousin's wrong doing out on your bf.
yes boo he feeling you alright.
and all us woman want that.
I guess you like the forbidden fruit... and nope I'm not too proud.
You talk like my sister 2. break up with him
have you ever talked to him?
because of their insecurities and immaturity..
sometimes he has a bad attitude and then he is just miserable!
maybe u should try spying on him?
do you wanat to ask him out ot not?
you really need to say how big it is
Just come right out and ask.
you can't really motivate anybody unless they motivate themselves.
With that said, yes, men do this just like I'm sure women do.
you really need to say how big it is
walk up to me and start making out with me
Just come right out and ask.
you can't really motivate anybody unless they motivate themselves.
With that said, yes, men do this just like I'm sure women do.
Guys just know that treating girls like trash is ok because society says it is.
its up to you guys to work things out.
maybe you should go out with your friend.
YEAH I DO THAT ATOT AND I'M ONLY 15
if he won't tell you, then do some investigate yourself.
hi... just close ur eyes ask urself.... r u in love?
Not all women are like that.
i love him , what should i do?
I love good guys, which means that im bad....bwahahaah
Not all women are like that.
i love him , what should i do?
I love good guys, which means that im bad....bwahahaah
WELL WELL WELL... a question of the 90's  Well its not for me to answer but for you...
but wut u need to kno is if he luvs her bck.
Well first off with your spelling what ever you do... do not write him a letter!!
nobody really has the answer for you.
I was just amazed I was having sex.
The most important - DON'T PUSH HIM.
what does a girl want from what???
Yeah, give her the space she needs.
If he thinks it's alright and you don't - that is on Oposite ends of the book.
give him a break and just continue your friendship.
A girl that loves car racing just like you do!
He just wants to get some and move on.
talk to him and let him know that you care about him
I always tried to remain friends with guys i dont see as potential boyfriends.
LET GO,  GO WITH YOUR MIND AND NOT YOUR HEART.
is her life worth going on with out her cheating husband i say yes.
i think it is cheating because you are going behind your bboyfriends back with another man .
KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR FRIEND SHE MAY WANT YOU FOR HERSELF
my friend has cought her boyfriend with emails to proove he has cheated on her.
or if you want to do a quiet dinner at home, start thinking about the meal now.
[it depends on if he gives me the creeps or not]
Ur friend wife is a freak.
Ask him where this is coming from?
i was with a woman who was just shy of 300lbs.
I dont want to just be like a jerk about it.
Learn to put that into words and WHAM!
But it's not uncommon for a girl to watch porn.
Now go back to rocking quietly in your chair...
IF that person was truely ur friend u never did wat u did.
guys like girls for their simplicity, humor, intelligence.
If you're your dad, it is.
regroup, take time for self then date!
Maybe she was the back up girl I dont know but I dropped him too,,,,
when, when u are absolutely positive u love him.
open the car door for her.
Actually to know me is to love me...lol,wanna see if what i say is true?
trust me the guy wont mind.
ALL MARRIAGES ARENT YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR MARRIAGE WORK AND MOST IMPORTANT COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR SPOUSE.
Don't ask her friends, that's not very nice (what if she's not cheating on you?).
that's jus a little advice to help ya.
because they are desperate and dont have a fu*k!n life
if she loves you back and you both want to be married then maybe -
He did behind ur back once why wouldn't he do it agoin.
he is your friend he will never turn get over it and be a friend
I think it is the other way around
and do it cuz u like the guy not b-cuz u kno ur ex will get mad.
all jokes aside, if you love him tell him .. true love will find a way
how can you say you love a person you don't know.
compliment them on things besides their body.
they want to have fun and feel relaxed with that person.
KEEP A GOOD WATCH AND PAY ATTENTION TO HIS DEMEANOR.
I have the same thing happing to me!
No way i once dated a guy that bought me face wash for Christmas.
should u that is entirely up to you.
I think thats why some guys like me.
Talk to her... maybe she likes you too!
Don't think about her, it just makes things worse.
BUT IS SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE NEW AT THIS, SO YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
How do i shake her off.
sex i am a man and thats wat i wanted
how do i ask out a guy if i am a little shy around guys.
I guess it's ok for the person that actually wants to date him for some reason.
Sounds to me as tho you are trying to get back at the world!
..ur heart will itself tell u.
My advise is to tell her your feelings for her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
but maybe u should just explore.
My man bestfriend is a female, and I really don't have a problem w/ it.
People always want what they can't have.
he simply will not do it.
If I like his hair and eyes, I am sooo in over my head!
You should call the police and tell them that your boyfriend got stolen!!
Thats where we learn about sex.
I know where one great one is!
Well I look at him and deside if he is doable are not.
Can he take an ED med like Viagra?
Tell him straight smack on his face!
or can i do this to u now.... i would love to try that!
I told the guy to chill out a little and maybe you should do that too!
and find a new love or a hobbie you knw mingle
Looks like gimpy's got you beat ;-) It's tough dating women online and then having them be a no-show.
Yall may end up getting married some day...
jus take a deep breath and ask her out!!
For example, if he comes home late, don't say, You're so rude and inconsiderate!
the only way is to TALK
women who look like they don't wear makeup are much sexier.
you cant do that when you are far apart.
I once had a friend who's friend told her boss that her friend was dating the bosses friend.
Your ex is just that...your ex.
It's just not worth the hassle.
let him ask you the right thing later.
you've lost a lover and a friend.
Don't worry about it at all.
depends...  most of the city girls :: cars, cash, bling2x
WHY IS THIS QUESTION ON SINGLES AND DATING ANYWAY??
who do u want to be with.
I got jealous of the girl I introduced him to.
Like it is with us femals, some like skinny guys some bigger ones... etc.
THEN go meet and find someone else u can trust and be happy with....
i repeat do not be annoying.
IF YOUR SO HOT WHY CANT YOU FIND WOMEN BY YOURSELF INSTEAD OF ADVERTISING ON THE INTERNET?
If people don't like that, it's their problem!
He is a good guy though!
U COULD MOVE ON WITH THE GROVE ON OK KICKK IT GIRL PS OUT YALL
But if he can't I suggest dump him!
Nothing big, but it was a lie :(  Anyway, I don't think she liked it.
you cant tell simply by looking at him....... thats all a bunch of crap!
If it keeps happening ask him what the hell is so important that this girls name keeps coming up.
TALK TO HIM... Let him understand that what he did or say is wrong...
u gain more out of love than lust   love rocks!!
if you are not exclusively dating someone, then have fun talking, flirting, hey dating other people.
they say all is fair inlove and war .
depends on the catch.... nobody give you 14 million for nothing
you dont its not your buisness....your daughter needs to be the one looking in to it!
And a lot of men are the same way.
What is she willing to do for you?
On your birthday or the other persons birthday!
be there when he needs you.
sometimes i feel like punchin her friends but i never have and probably wont...
But beware of what type of church you go to.
i had a friend swoop in on my ex the night we broke up.
But i don't have a clue of what to say or who to tell.
ITS TIME TO LET THAT FRIEND.
It might behurt but you need to do what is best for you.
because rush of emotions come and go.
i would, even if i had to brutaly murder some1s family and them.
it really depends on how he is.
We just have to learn how to pick the ones that are keepers before we sleep with them!
just do it secretly, many do so but in secret ways
Besides - watch the old movie Revenge of the Nerds the main nerd scores with a super hot chick.
I am just a dog, you know.
And plus the whole i love u thing wears out if said to much anyway.
However, if it is just chit chat and nothing sexual, i wouldn't worry any.
that's what you should do give her some space.
Not to be so direct but... tie your shoes alot!
it cheaper to run you own through paper work and the mail.
I once juggled 4 women for a few weeks ...... it just about killed me.
for sure ull find a sweeet human being in me.
Pretty women are pretty.... hardly dependant on their hair color.
the only thing you can tell by looking at him is if hes hot and you want him!!!!
If a man hit u once don't think for a chance that he wouldn't do it again.
It's called IS SHE REALLY GOING OUT WITH HIM.
i was born at night but, not last night!
just tell her that maybe someone is waiting for her or fit for her than this guy.
PS  They probably are NOT in love, you just think that.
can you honestly be this naive??
Come on give us a break were men.
I know it sucks but sometimes you just need to do this.
First get her permission, then use your LIPS!
But I can't even get a guy to watch Brokeback Mtn with me (and none are homophobic).
God yeah, dont wanna make him think your frigid!
Ask him if he likes you then go on from there.
If I was in her position I dont know ..
yes but that would be tough.
yEAH WHEN I WAWS YOUNGER BUT THE QUESTION IS HAVE YOU????????????????
No, you obviously don't know the difference between they're, their, and there, so definitely NOT.
hang in there, it'll be okay, it just takes time.
your boyfriend loves you and you dont love him, damn are you cold hearted....lol just messing with you!!!
beacause they can and there are plenty of willing women
I tried it and it worked so nicely.
He might not be the type that likes chocolates or teddy bears so give him lots of sex.
rarely does it work the way it's supposed to .
oh yeah, and some flowers.....the censored section says d i l d o
You're on thin ice here princess...you are, aren't you?
Gee, I'm glad I don't fit in that category!
sometimes it works but sooner or later they will start actin mature...sooner or later.
doggie style or on your side.
move on theres somebody out there 10 times better !
Or the two of you are too young.
my ex didn't, but ya I beleive they can it depends.
You won't know, unless they tell you!
i find that roofies work best for me
godwilling he will be there for u :) if NO then u know better what to do.
may be yes ,,, some money problem....
the suspition is in it's self a problem.
Well he's pretty young to have one but anyway i'll tell u.
OMG NO, any guy who plays you is a lying cheating butt!
i don't think thats cool because they are going to wonder why.
no its not correct u cant trust anyone like this
but so u know what some want.
i dont see why he would break up with someone who he really likes.
Do you like working with little kids?
Just dont beat him at his own game *smile*
But once you do have sex, it's gonna hurt.
does your friend  have to be muslim?
You just have to know what you have and what you want to keep and don't back down.
and for real, his looks will grow on you
It would not be good for you.
MAYBE WHEN GOD WAS PASSING OUT SAUSAGES HE RAN OUT AND GAVE YOU A WEENIE.
Yup, when I was a baby.
The one with the good job.
Maybe u should talk to him and tell him how much u used to like it.
I dont want to be a lone for the rest of my life  I need some good answers.
Try being single, do what you want and have some fun.
Don't feel bad If they don't say hi !!
WOW, I am glad you are not my friend.
what i mean by this is he be falling for you then you be falling for him!
dont talk crap, cause it will turn around and bite cha in the butt.
my wife admits to humping a pillow when she was 6
just kidding, but seriously how could anyone really describe what love is?
Its seems like your mister popular now!
It may be a slow process cuz love doesnt just HAPPEN!!
So I found myself again, relearned all my mannerisms, and I tried to go out with other men.
well do run away and then live good with his beep
Any ideas what this dream means?
pleasuring yourself by playing with your genitals until you get off
to not hurt there filling you should simply ask them
I think it said it was like $500, but it was pretty cool how accurate it was.
You don't need that, no one does.
u cant all ways hate thim
yes, girl show him who he is in ur life...
If he leaves wont you wonder what could have happend?
Just don't forget one thing, that people DO CHANGE.
that's why i don't have lover.
This works most of the time...
of course no one know.How about I give you an idea, just go ask her..........!!!
like, once the tax period is over.
could be ,u never know what could be going through our minds.
Complex question... go here to read why I say so.
When you always try to be close to someone.
u never had sex or...u r underage....
no you weren't wrong at all, if you don't want to then don't do it.
go somewhere where u can actually talk alot and laugh try starbucks
i did at age 10 1/2
I know how tough it is!
and you can see if can meet some from you father's frieds sons or your mather's friends sons
i AM VERY SAD.SHOULD I TELL MY FRIEND HOW I FEEL?
it's life, you have to take a chance.
No, but I love that song!!!!!
It's the first steps of love, you should enjoy it!!
Ouch, thats my biggest turn off.
have you been walking up to strange women and kissing them?
Personally I don't really care if they have a job, just as long as they get one soon.
Thats my problem with my jackass exboyfriend!
but im telling you both is going to end up being hell.
14 is too young.. you just dont know the consequences that might happend to you, save it..
I almost always (9 out 10) give money .
because the girls get into more  in   love  and  in   the  relatiionship
I really don't like this,  am I wrong for being extremely mad?
That tells me the girl isn't interested.
she will come sooner or later.
neither find a girl that has done it once or twice.
Don't let your husband ruin your's and baby's life.
Unless, of course, you're old with money...lol.
no, im kind of curious though.
if you are 21 you really dont have to tell her.
he might get scared and it would be weird afterwards if he doesn't like you back.
i am right there in the confusion with you.
same thing usually with girlfriends and boyfriends.
no cause you two were not going out anymore
she didnt mean to but it happenes in life!
Sounds like you should wait until you find someone you love.
same thing usually with girlfriends and boyfriends.
no cause you two were not going out anymore
she didnt mean to but it happenes in life!
Go somewhere fun Where You can laugh.
what are some ways i can make my boyfriend happy?
Go a noch out of ur way so that he can see ur about something.
I think its there way of saying they like you.
MOVE ON (and don't forget the punch him part.)
Dont try and look for an older guy.
Flirting is just fun and doesnt necessarily mean anything.
IF you have to ask where babys come from.
but do a cross of sounding smart but with acting stupid.
It is best to ask your mother that question!
has anyone done or witnessed this before?
Ever think of addoption..or get a pet!
hire a cute babysitter, then take the kids to a movie.
But I say it's mostly about The nookie (come on!
uh no, i have nothing against them but i wouldnt pick them over someone else
Also, another thing is that I probably wouldn't have married him if I wasn't pregnant.
He used to cheat?.....as in more than once?
And, no, I'm not trying to be sarcastic, I'm really curious...
Instead of flirting with them, acting cool, and interesting, they just act stupid!
She goes in this I hate men website.
Don't mess with her and talk to your wife.
Next time you see him, ask him out!!
i will tell u after u do it wth me 2 lol
you and your boyfriend aren't really fighting.
if  you  werent  to  gether  it  wasnt  cheating.
Leave that man and new girl alone!!!
types of hugs gentle or strong or strong with grabbing of her butt.
The weather is so variable I can't imagine why you would put your family and friends through this.
i am widowed and i am definitely not looking forward to valetines day :(
go and find a new and fresh boyfriend.
(if you have a good smile) lol women know when men are trying to get with us.
Suttle ways: massage her hair while rubn your hand along her leg.
they could break your heart without even trying too.
Girl- You know this one is bad news.
having a penus put into my p*ussy
it could go the other way though.
Well if he closed that IM fast like you said, he obviously has something to hide.
after being together for 3yrs, its still great.
I hate the whole demanding diva routine!
Quit beating yourself up over this.
what about a man who has beeen seperated form hos wife for 6 yrs.
(was that short and to the point?)
bcuz its sick looking and just gross
Yes, I love my self me and I
it depends does he help out you and your children?
all you got to do is put this loser behind you .
If you go to the movies, you really can't do much but sit and watch.
and you need to take a moment and look at your life and reclaim your identity.
When u feel to kiss some one.
thats the best thing u can do...
Just be honstely with her tell to hold on u think she nice and u want ask her out.
how should i approach her next time i ask her?
if she says 'no-i have a bf' ask if she didn't have a bf-would she consider it.
you will just end up hurting a virgin and you wont even feel it with a pornstar.
unless your into hurting people then go with the virgin.
I had mine at 11 With Meredith my Baby Whaich iam happily married to Now I LOVE HER
:0(  DO THE BEST WITH WHAT YOU HAVE,THERE IS NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.
Gotta be in the bathroom on an airplane.
if you find one, let me know and hopefully we can hook up and chat.
I know my wife reads all my obnoxious comments on this answers stuff...  yea  word
u know u dont need details!
a kiss and a rose bud!
go after him, dont lose him!
its not cheating if you were not together
buy him a new car if you can afford
Just don't get married right away.
be yourself dont go out of you way to impress her .
you are too young to have a baby .
One of them probaly likes u and if they don't they are just too much into your life.
ASK HER IF SHE'D LIKE TO GO OUT FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.
I would never even consider going gay, I don't think I'd watch Brokeback Mtn either...
Do you want a guy like that?
So...when THE BIG BIRTHDAY ARRIVES...what am I supposed to do?
hope you are lucky enough to experience it
Just be yourself and sombody will love you just the way you are.
you never love the same way twice.
MUST I BE ALONE FOREVER MORE??
love is something which i lost 26 days ago
be careful with the women becasue sometimes they do not know what they wants.
by what youve said here , why would you want to be with him after this ?
you should ask yur friends to stop and tell them it isn't funny.
yes and no u can set them up in dates but its up to ur best friend
give him that records..and dump him!
you never know until you try
If you honestly like him then I say go for it.
But that may be just me.
Get your self busy, is the best way.
to worry or should i just give up and let him work things out on his own?
i broke up with him on monday the 23rd.
For boys, i like etnies, or vans, and i am a girl.
then you put mr happy up in it until you both have a happy ending.
i wood give u a hug but i don think its humanly possible to do that through the internet.
I learned what and where I went wrong and now, We're back together!
They make us get a hard on
Join a club, take a class, etc...
Natalie just seems like the right one!
i'm sorry to say that u'll never win her love since u didn't even have it from the beggin!!
do the best for your child if nothing else .
you can go to chat-avenue .com its fun for all ages.
MEBE  BUT   IT   COULD    ALSO   BE  THAT   SHE  MISSES  BEING   AROUND  YOU.
certainly ... this is the time when one should explore the new corners and funs of life.
Honestly I think most couples dont register anymore because they really do just want cash .
No, wait while u can because when u get hooked u get hooked.
BUT IF THEY DONT COME JUST KNOW THAT IT'S THEIR LOST NOT YOURS.
first stop flirting and then ask him what his intentions are.
but that's b/c they're still in school too.
i am sorry for both of you.
This begs bigger questions - like is your girlfriend truly untrustworthy or are you just a control freak?
i find it really childish but the problem is i really really love him soo much.
no cause you to are not together anymore
funny, caring, and good looking, someone who says i'm pretty, not hot.
ohhhh yeah latins are hot and as a lover mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
You mean BOB - battery operated boyfriend
evidently he falls really easy but you have to be the judge of that one!
and i hate these kinds of questions.
WHY NOT , YOU WILL ENJOY IT JUST AS MUCH AS HIM, !
What happens when men go hunting?
try something new, if you know what i mean.
Ask her have you ever thought of how it feels to be like me.
Sit in front of him and give him a foot massage.
Man you really hit a low note with this question.If its in this section i guess your a stalker,right?
you kno wat if a women emailed you she'd be crazy because what kind of guy does that.
Like before we even went out.
And you had sex with another guy for 1 day.
Yo, don't fall for it again!!!
but i'm a fat, mean lesbian.
Just not sure what you are looking for here.
dont lie , tell him you are bored ..
Money and a nice care always works!
that's kinda gross actually, i think that it's not true love couze its a fart lol
knowing that the guy wants to spend time wiht them and the way they look at their women
theres one around the coner aiting for you.
No way you could really be dating some wirdo murder!
I HATE olives, but some men love them!
that's kinda gross actually, i think that it's not true love couze its a fart lol
theres one around the coner aiting for you.
No way you could really be dating some wirdo murder!
I HATE olives, but some men love them!
What if the guy you like gets mad and doesn't want anything to do with you anymore?
do alot of it....just dont be a tease.
even in highschool they act stupid to impress girls.
You called him a BOY so I'm guessing that you already know the answer
when you dont want one,  you dont notice anyone elses interest.
SO TELL YOUR FAMILY YOU LOVE THEM AND BE HAPPY.
Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
you do it like they do on the discovery channel
yes, without commitment there would be no love?
baby girl ur looking in all the wrong places i'm right here
i asked wat present should i give a guy,  two of the answer were head.
if she says 'no'-then walk away.
what i would'ent give to be her thong.
NOthing is worth taking yor own life.
What the guy looks like would not be a big deal, but his personality would matter.
You chat with him a lot.
it's not like you were still with him and you slept with this other guy.
ask is not the best place to be getting this stuff.
Only long enough to wrap you back in!
so my final answer would be hell no
Some guys are just scared others are taken.
Girl, I think you just need to cut it, but that's just me.
GO UP TO HIM AND ASK HIM ''DO YOU STILL LIKE ME OR WHAT?''
IF NOT THEN SIT DOWN WITH HIM TALK OUT YOUR FEELING.
more than half of lovers find other ways to enjoy themselves!!
8 secs is a good ride.
Also...you should really be asking you friends this!
i dont think love has a time limit at all.
next year it's his turn to hire a sitter, then you take the kids to a movie
SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO HELP THERE OWN SELF AND YOU CAN NOT HELP HIM.
4eva is a long time, could he be serious, don't be blind of nice words
oysters,  pumpkins seeds by the hand full
i agree with sonflower, if you wanted him you wouldn't have cheated.
dont wait untill after, it would be rude to do so!!
HIs or yours i dont know
a  mans words give out alot of him self.
ooo that would be funny lol but the girl should be his fiance.
no, he only want to fuck you
Yes I consider myself to be a good lover--I just know it--
But really sweetie.. if this guy can't see what a beautiful person you are he isn't worthy of you.
Have u every asked yourself do u really like this new guy or do u just wanna get revenge.
I think he really loves u now so when ur alone ask him or phone him.
I once took out an amazingly hot young woman.
you are your own woman, if he wants to think that is cheating, then that's his loss...
It kinda sounds like she wants you to make the choice!
i would probably say carnival cruise lines.
Some women (and men) just like to flirt.
I feel bad for you little guy
Don't worry about what's gay and what's straight, just like who you like and do what feels right.
At certain ages and imaturity, hard testicles is always a problem!
you are to gay men, that's for sure
I say it cheatin is wrong no mater what reason you have.
no dudes dont dig that shit
Mines is big...okay no its not.But I have a guy.
But hey i've dated woman and they can be lunatics.
Get her really drunk and attempt to make out with her.
she'll realize it and tell her no matter what you'll be there for her.
And you're an amazing lover if you can simultaneously climax!
if he has been in love three times did he lose his love to death or break up?
ask her and when you do, do it with compasion and look her in the eyes.
if that picture is giving you discomfort, why not tell him?
so my best wishes for u both !
he might not want her to be with you and that how?
if i dated someone simply because of their looks, which i dont, i probably would dump them.
thats  kinda  sterotyipical   dont  you  think?
ANd then he thinks i am faking it.
But i'll say it, get rid of him!!!!
IF YOU TRY TO GET HIM SOMETIME AND HE ALREADY HAS IT HE COULD ALWAYS HAVE TWO OF IT!
you have to think about wich you like more or don't date ether of them pick some one else
Get rid of your past demons (why do you not like women?)
So I'm guessing the sex won't either.
Have you ever even heard of that Sir-Mix-a-lot song?
I decided I wanted him back.
He sounds like my ass of a cheeting ex.
CHECK THEY UNDERWEAR,  IF YOU SEE BLOOD THERE YOU GO.
Or, you could just ask him if he likes you like a real girlfriend.
like if it is to the point where you have think about someone else during sex to get off....
any volunteer moms need a baby like me?
Just think of the type of reception you want.
they want waht they cant have
JUST PUT YOUR BOOT IN HIS BUT AND SAY HOLLA
he loves me but I do not find him phyisically attractive.
All you other kids, grow up yourselves.
Hopefully you like the person a lot.
just be true to your heart!!!!!
i have been in a situation like that before, and yes you need to worry.
nobody said love was easy, and it certainly is not!
i think she is smat but she acts like she is stuped.
If he played with you last year .. he will play with you this year.
well sum gurl do but not all gurls
of course it is the only way to go for me...
its nice to hav a girl with a big butt, they are the easiest to get a piece of.
kind of like asking a doctor to be a good patient... right?
the real question is can't u wait?!
but that doesn't mean that your boyfriend should/wants to know about it.
WHAT SHOULD I DO/ HE'S ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR KIDS IN SCHOOL, WHAT IF HE DOSEN'T LIKE ME?
Its seems like everything has to be some great contest....like love.
Sorry couldn't tell you the signs, cuz I missed them.
i would do the same thing.
Oh, don't do this; it's illegal.
weel ya if he had a good explanation.
girl i doubt hat its going to be a problem in the future.
i would deffinantly get checked out.
depends on how capable you are  !!
do what you want and screw the other people.
its nothing u can do but deal with it or leav
ask him about it and if he becomes upset then 9*10 he is doing it.
umm yeah you might be getting played here.
I say love, it is a flower,  And you it's only seed.
Honey if you are asking this question then you already know the answer!
tell your bestfriend that her boyfriend tried to put a move on you
Why u want to rell that!
aks a guy out on that day and u will feel happy.
See, guys are scared of sex by trait, women are not.
sure....keep in mind everything is a social construct...love when your're ready for it teen or not.
Been there,done that and never again!!!
I want to date this girl.
YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF ME IF YOU LIKE
He just wanted it to be simple.
Looking to fool around a bit online

A b***h is a sl*t that f*cks every 1 but me.
I still fantasize about my wife when she was pregnant....she was sooo horney.
Why haven't you told them yet?
I happen to weigh less than 110 lbs, but that is so stupid!
If you even remotely question it...and especially have to ask..chances are ...you ARE.
i prefer an equal amount of both
discreet relation but just on the net conaction98@yahoo.com
Say thanks for all the good times, but right now, you need time to think about things.
Like, your names or...'i love you' or a heart or a picture of you guys!
To make ur someone happy .
we not together and i was not in the mode.
and it doesn't matter that i am a very large woman.
(You never have enough time anyway) I am a 30 Y.O.
becuase he was getting IT when he said that
your have to think..  if iam in yur situation ..
Could it be you and not him????
if you feel its right then get married, if not dont, because divorce wastes a lot of money.
If you did not, then talk about it now.
YOU ARE GOING TO GO BLIND DUDE!
find a nice guy for yourself ^_^.
i say you invite who you want at the wedding and who you want at the reception.
do we like espacially european girls?
LEARN HOW TO USE WHAT YOU HAVE  WELL,AND BECOME A MASTER IN O*AL SEXX.
He needs to knock that shit off and act like a man!
At least not for a while, anyway.
no you dumb *itch, haha I know her, tell her to *uck off
She doesn't need friends like that...
because you can not do it as good as BIG MOMMA.
you should only give him a kiss if he acts like he wants to kiss you.
If she looks sweet dont use tongue and if she looks like a stripper use tonque.
YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AND NOT HIM RIGHT NOW.
I don't have a problem with gay women...I know they like me.
Just kidding, no it's totally ok to be gay.
JUST ASK HER 4 HIS E-MAIL !
i hope so if nothing else god loves u
wear your shirt lower than normal for more cleavage near him :)
It can only lead to bad vibes and bad office talk!!!
I squirt, and I'm not ashamed; of course, I'm a guy...
:)  You'll know true love when you get there!
Scare the crap out of him!
im married, have been for a long time.
be super nice to her and do whatever she wants and never lie or do anything bad to her
It sounds strange, but most people don't want to sit through the wedding anyways!
Is he blowing me off nicely?
i can luv 'very 1 to the full of my capacity
How old is the guy and probably at least 18
I love it alot--I can be down there for like 2 hours...
that i would miss them more than anything, afraid
LOve?...Love takes time to grow like a flower...You mean lust...for you..
I am REALLY sorry but i have to say no
I know it might be wrong but I'm in love with Stacey's mom.
for other signs i really dont know but that will be the most thing i know a sign...
Usually when I talk about someone a lot it means that I'm thinking about that person a lot.
i dont know im still trying to figure that out for myself
The thing is, I never get to see any of it.
It's just that hotel rooms and girlfriends go absolutely PERFECT together...like peanut butter and jelly!!!
It was so funny tho because they look EXACTLY alike.
it probaly couldnt hurt to visit tho but dont move in.
Am I kidding myself about being gay?
NO, I HAVENT YET, BUT I WOULD IF MY PARTNER WANTED TO.
he alwayz calls me his buddy but he kinda gets on my nerves.
AN APPLE CAN LOOK GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT CAN BE COMPLETELY ROTTEN ON THE INSIDE.
dont give him impression that, u wnat to go sexually with him.
don't let other people who you should date or like.
let him to injoy u in bed
do we really need another person who calls himself a pimp?
Well if some 1 like u they really don`t care how u look.
be honest &tell your best friend then brake it off w/the guy.
It is the best online dating site there is... and its free.
Like most of these people say,some guys do some dont.
he left you because variety  is interesting and something is missing.
U deserve anything u could ever wish for.
wait for sometime , if u r destined to fall into real-love, thats wat u call it , right?
jus let him know he would tell u how he feel
Is it her or you that has no desire for the other one.
First off, if he's stupid enough to cheat, hes not good enough for you!
hi  do most of the activities as if near to her but dont talk .
You fix it- what is marriage all about anymore- didn't you make a vow (jennifer Lopez)!!
well pam has hep c angelina is preggers so guess carmen but the whole dennis rodmen thing.
Is she playing with her hair and at times bashfully looking away?
some things you just have to realize for yourself.
Y does she purposly try to get me mad?

She saw something she wanted and she went after it.
its just about our favorite part a girls body!

I like big butts, and i cannot lie!

WHAT that doesn't make any since
if u want 2 $hit blood for a hour sure go for it wat could it hurt........UR A$$
First of all Why would you want him back after he cheated on you?
im not gay but i'd go for jessica alba anytime...lol
Are all 3 of u in love, or is it just sex.
If you want me, you have to ask me out in person.
i has so many girls friends but i don't  have any lover.
Is it that hard to fine a good friend there?
but its also possible you might have something hanging out of you nose.
Just think about what she'd like best.
dating is just having fun yaar!
why would you give of yourslef of your body to someone you dont love?
YES IT IS  FUN BRINGING THEIR PERSONBALITIES OUT
none of that really matters but its always a plus but most girls go for the personality
ok if u want we can do it in style :drealsunny@yahoo.com
first u need the look, then the additude(not spelled right-right?)
havent done that but i would if my partner really wants it..
he loves me for me, for who i am as a person.
my girl friend is the best..
all up to you,but if your in no hurry and she is make her file
If he don't like you, then its possible that he has his own reasons.
a candle, something with a sesual scent, like mint.
YOU WILL KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS TOO !
if he plays with your heart, he doesn't like you at all.
kiss her when you are in the nude
Don't bother with people who even know him.
Just think back to when you first started having sex.... how did you act?
Her sister really sux and so does her dad Homer.
confidence is sexy, anything else is an accessory, but certainly nice touches.
i dnt kno i do those all tha time dont mean nuhin 2 me.
A lady never tells her age!
Did you hear shes considering a boob job?
he is geting bord with her but he sill likes her.
Your wife will be the one you spend the rest of your life with, not your mommy or daddy.
I will be your net friend if you be mine yes or no: Jaleshia101@yahoo holla at me baby boy
$100 says that your a chick and the 55 year old is a guy.
nothing,never mind that kinda friend,lots of people here wants to have more friends and i am one of those...
umm no.. stop asking dumb questions!
if you do not love why would you cheat?
remember..  no man is an island..(--,)
and I'm still with him :-)
what sucks is when you see her with another guy and your like... mmmm must do something.. NOW!
the gambling part is : maybe he does love you too, just like you still love him
That or maybe try using a big club!
hey listen... go n talk to ur man!!
and feel wanted and turned on.
If you are over 10 go for it!!!!
yes I have a crush on him!
something u'll never be able to describe it untill u try it
jennifer lopez seems to be doing well.
I am going to say proably not.
it probaly wont be a problem if u really like the guy
a new one helps a lot
good luck i have 3 exes
no you should because she mit be sick and you don't what to get sick.
He didn't and is DIRT for doing something like that to you!!
without any hassels of dating sites.
It's like gambling for a husband.
so i guess actually none of them
Plus, you can do the Wanna have lunch?
(And prayer is a great way to start - I'll certainly be praying for you!)
Letters are a winner - everyone loves to get 'snail mail'
dont love him,he will fall 100%
No he's not cute he's absolutely sexy.
Which ideas that both of you guys are comfortable to do.
i would be with my best friends .
Cheating only applies for married people, but with boy and girlfriends, it doesn't matter.....but of course it is painful
her eyes, then hands, then hair, then shape of body,
But  just dont know  what to do?
i like the butt i think it is the first thing i look at first
what do u mean by additude
its a way of flirting ,thats for shure.
i look just like my avatar and i have a 6 pack.
there are black women that prefere white men.
Hope this helps a little ..
DO GIRLS REALLY THINK LIKE THAT OR ITS JUST ME.
Everytime I buy him something I always have to take it back b/c he already has one!!
start dating u can ask them u know
I love those English guys 2.
we also save them to read months & years later!
Its only your hormones going all wacko
if she is really a good friend then she'll listen to you.
get in the kitchen and fix me a sandwich, thats how i usually say it.........LOL
depends how u look like blonde long hair ect.
He might not buy it even then, but that's the only thing I can think of.
Because such women themselves are losers!
THIS LOOKS LIKE A GUY CHOICE TO MAKE!!
but try and put a spin on it.
ull know ull know dont worry and have fun
Show her all there is to see.
they just want for us to get confused!
if she says 'yes'-that kinda sucks.
this isn't always going to be true though.
A lot of girls like fat guys ;)
to me dirty feet from a woman is because men don't like to suck stinky toes
My friend just had to remove the sleves and the bow and make it shorter cuz im short
yes ofcourse ilove you just u are any more
if they dont like it then you know where they stand in your life.
I didn't think it was particularly romantic if thats what you are asking...
we where married at 2 months.
you have to tell him that he confuses you a lot.
I would pick a guy with the great personality, i mena looks and moneya re just bonus.
if you need to ask,you probably aren't old enough.
Its wat u feel about that special person.
4.drooling,i hate guys that let their mouths hang open 5.shrieking like a girl.
it will carry over into the rest of the year watch and you will see!
i mean it can hurt but we have to be willing to forgive.
find her a daddy thats worthy of this title .
You know Zeke and others j/k(u no who)
If she's your best friend then you should just go ahead and tell her, she won't mind!
Hope you find your answer very soon then :)

or  Would you rather just have mad passionate sex???
Hell Ya- I hate it when people think just because the woman is making more they have to split.

I can learn to love you ;)
ur mind can play games with u

I have a boyfriend kind of like that too.
WELL SHE WOULD HAVE THOSE THINGS WHETEHER YOU CAN TELL IF YOUR PREGNAT OR NOT
Might nit hurt if he was there too
Drop that loser, and get with a real man!!!
i dont think you want to be friend with him.
only do it if he wants to kiss you, too.
sure, i have and we have been together for almost 2years
you stare at each other all day long but never talk too each other
YOU NEED TO GET TOTALLY AWAY.
if there isn't we should start one
MY boyfriend has pictures of his ex-girlfriends and girls he has messed around with.

Look up EroticBakery & look at the Bachelor Party trays!
he must like u, i mean think about, what other reason is there
If you do, what male shoe style do you like???
How do you get out of it??
Most guys think about sex every 3 seconds.
What ever you do don't go to the movies.
if he dumps you over that the loose him cause he's not good enough.
And the same old tired answer .... TIME!
But do u really want to be with someone that cheats?
If you dont know how to flirt maybe youre too young?
Don't give up on him just yet!
so be careful on who you trust.
You Are a Responsible Gentle Man  Else.. Get MARRIED...
you must go because this is old and i will move oN because you don't turn me on!
Unless I can trust a person with my life then I would not call him FRIEND...
is that person a good friend of his/hers????
such as bowling, tennis, rock climbing..    chatting over some drinks or food?
lolz licking touching kissing rubbing smelling feeling  mmm
So swim on back to sea, orcas.
is it me or is it everyone else?
Go for another love.... he's not so real...
A song by Haddaway from the 80's:)
I mean, what if you would send for one and he would turn out to be a real jerk?
If he does not want you then send him to hell and get on with yourself girl.
If I only had the answer to this question...I would be rich...lol!
if so talk to her on her level even though its not your style.
There are 2 kinds of women, b***hes and sl*ts.
Dancing, horseback riding, sitting on the beack, reading, whatever.
Unless of course if u are just searching for a mother-material only, u can just try nanny services.
when you want a bf your senses for that are heightened.
a lil after that he was trying to feel on and i told him  no.
You don't deserve the wife you have now buddy!
BUT REMEBER THAT YOUR ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL NO MATTER WHAT!
who cares let her learn on her own or are you the sister keeper huh?
you and me  used to be we are not one so i have to run!
No matter what he looks like?
as long as it takes to keep this house for your kids
do ya think its true that men times by 3 and women divide by 3 admitting sex partners..
At the movies you can't talk.
That depends on alot of thing!
make her think ,maybe she'll come around.
Goggle Light Her Fire  It works.
because the think with their little head instead of their big head!
I don't know I have neevr had sex.
But do it in caring way.
cuz if shes tha tomboy type...den prob not lol but if shes da mushy type den YES she will.
having a finger in my a** while having s*x d*ggy style
most of them i see are usally mean and horrible.
Because there trying to hook up with a girl....and they want to show off there abs(if they hav any)lol
love is metter of heart.it can be in just in a wink of eyes
first of all there is no easy way to dump some one its going to hurt no matter what.
Even when I was pregnant with our baby!
I guess I should express that sort of thing more often...
but dont let him find out for a long while...
um.... let's see about this can u find me?
When youre not married, its wrong either way.
i have always loved my girl friend to depth of my heart.
answer me that then i can answer yours.
watch hitch and then ull understand
why would you want to defeat it?
there are no limits to your style, so have fun!
(i'm always sure to return the favor)
get in his head 1st !!!!!!
Then ask her when that bug up her ass is going to die.
he is going to complain .
If you did that then you really don't like him!
It depends on how old you are!!
it depends on the age I guess...what are the ages?
(hopefully his name is not john - or it could be the same man).
your talking to one u weirdo
Chances are he just wants to mess with you again.
Well...it seemed pretty sad if you have sex with someone you don't feel anything...(like one night stand).
hide in the closet spy on em
then their is my bf, who buys me whatever i want.
You sound like you are sort of on the side.
i want to be a young parent for my kids.
all i can say is go for it if you really like her
Lastly...only you can choose how this will go.
My boyfriend is the HARDEST guy to shop for!
who in they right mind want to fight everyday?
Hey everybody agrees and the answer is NO.
if she says 'yes i want go out with you'-then she's a cheater.
First why did you cheat on him in the first place?
Or do I just find a friend?
THANX FOR ASKING HOWS UR SEXY LIFE?
have treats and gifts laid out.
invite him to hang out with you and go get coffee or something, its a start.
and its the best thing i could have done for myself .
Many guys talk that way (like i miss you and so) when they don't mean it.
Take the kids and leave, man.
That girl has got it all!!
I enjoy laying my face on my guys chest and with hair there i wouldn't enjoy it at all.
and next thing i know we're dating.
and that is very important to me.
PLEASE LET ME GET CHAT ROOM EN ESPANOL
well, proper hygiene is still important!
mom of 3 (11,7, and 3) and a single parent at that.
You wont be sorry you tried it out, i promise.
No, but a lot of my best friends are going to hell.
maybe she doesnt mean to but if she does this is not good news at all.
u should tell them now that you are moving!
Look homie, you shouldn't try to change any girl!
god made them hot for a reason o_O
Rent a porn movie that has some scenes/positions that you like.
most of the time it is someone that has been hurt bad in the past.
so he got mad a left.
don't want to pay for a sit down mean for all the guests, have a buffet!
Ive never cheated and neither has she.
Maybe stay home, maybe go out to eat, etc.
give up on trying to understand em and just do your best to love the one u got
the worst that can happen is he says he doesnt like you...
I have been threw so much of my own its UN REAL!
Learn a martial art like karate
what u need to do is stop searching so desperetly.
But don't ever get in the middle of it, with him there.
Hey girls i think shas211 is asking guys.
because i feel that a sign of disrespect and ignorance.
i had the same problam                                                                 bye!
i doubt that's your cup of tea, darling.
Good luck, but also keep your eyes peeled for other girls around you too!
say i love u & kiss her
take a pill put some water on it and watch it grow
no not unless ur a neat freak
Don't believe a word he says
my advice is to stay that way for life.
If it was a person I already knew and trusted, it would be great!
he also said marriage is not for hime even though i would make a great wife.
But it sounds like you don't have enough courage to just GET OUT!
Does he seem to want to come back?
I see some have said disgusting Bull, I would not feed my baby anything disgusting, it lovely, natural milk.
i think very very far than u  think
no i like my girl th way she is smart funny ...
Would you like to go out with a guy that you don't like?
i couldn't choose one - my guy has to have at least something in each category.
Then get a girl to come in acting like a stripper...teasing him with a feather.
Dont get mad until your married and he still has them.
the hard answer (no pun intended):  take up some advanced meditation.
but everytime i try to hang out with her she never answers me.
wait......let me think, oh.. about you guys nope i have no idea what are you talking about.
Just thought I'd bring up the other side, stir things up a bit!
do you hear women asking about virginity of a guy?
If not, then don't be with him.
And what ppl can do to other ppl is straight BS.
Quit planning every minute of your life.
i give this question about 24 hours before they delete it but any way here goes.
yes if u hav marriage certificate or any valid proof of wedding then its valid in any country.
If not, that's ok, but I want to be clear.
Quit planning every minute of your life.
the best way is to get a prostitute.
but use to see them in the shower at school.
how do i make it stonger??
I may be wrong, i dont  know.
Sit her down and tell her.
seems you already have one important thing in common.
You are better off happy without an Idiot guy than miserable with one!
you dont have to do anything that you arent ready to do.
i guess so, but avatars make anyone look awsome.
If it doesn't bother him..then yes he wants to be JUST FRIENDS..
if your kind, funny, and everything listed above then to me that is without a doubt the best kind.

Dunno bro, I wonder why mine is so big.

i think that he likes you.
If they are bad it's because you are bad too.

one shouldn't have regrets in life.
according to his moves & eyes

i prefer when a guy does, myself.
No offense, but get your head out of your *ss!!
There is nothing wrong in it
and if he disagress juz b his friend!
Cuz a girl like that, probably other guys will like her too.
Why does their have to be a racial issue with love?
You don't won't him to hate you.

so yea find out wat type they r n do things dat fit dey personality or likes!
If he does claim her behind your back them report him to the IRS!!
Uuummm, no... not after I was an infant anyway.
if you are a virgin you might want to waiy other wise go for it
but dont let it be money
so just go ahead and ask him out :)
no one deserves to be treated like that.
It sucked and all I wanted was to be intimate with my wife.
drop that loser like the trash he is.
I dont normaly answer these kinds of things but urs caught my eye.
Should I wait to tell anyone???
Would you get to Stacey anyways by just asking her on the net on Answer Beta or what!
so unless you are sure that she is 100% not infected then i say be my guest.
How about you give him 365 days of SEX!
Buy him some gifts and he will be there 4 u.

I am a guy and i don't give mixed signals.

I am moveing and I am moveing and I told them by E-mailed them
Is he working late a lot?
i let my husband go and he came back and weve been together 9 years sence then.
i think most men like girls that make them feel special
If women turn you on too, then you're bi.

Those that do, do so in different ways.
And if your a virgin you should give it to some one special.
HEY ITS BETTER THAN GETTING AIDS HIV FROM SOMEONE
depends how your talking about them.
who makes the first move, the guy or the woman?
you'll want to kick him in the @#$%^&&*.
you are not suppose to be looking for the right guy.
I trust my whole life in their hands...
If that happens, she probably loves you.
you wont be alone for the rest of your life, unless you are like a recluse or something.
What was that, is that singing I hear in the back ground...........good thing there's flowers close by......lol, aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

accidently spilling something on her or urself.
you need to play his game girl!
ask her that u like me or not?simple
time and something to take your mind of it during that time
Come on, vote on the question already!
DONT WORRY THEY'LL LET YOU KNOW, JUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.
Once you get past that it would go to personality.
and you need to be mature to love somebody for more than just their butt.
WHENEVER U FEEL THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT DON,T TAKE IT ANY FUTHER THOUGH.
The only thing i would like to say is DIFFENTIATE BETWEEN DATING AND LOVE!
I would go for the guy
Cuz boys are looker and women are emotional
Us, girls dont deserve that kinda sh*t!
A evil stepmother (or one to be) I hate those.
The theory that black guys have bigger, you know what, is just a myth!!!!!!
Rubing on him and all that good stuff.
Over dinner I asked about her father.
it can't be fix, if you dont want to be with a man then just be alone  for ever
another idea is mix-n-matching your colors (ex.
if the answer from ur heart is YES then go for it !
and like, he used to be one of my best guy friends EVER.
what do u call  small ??
If package refers to the heart, then NO WAY small packages work with me!
Run, don't walk and find a new guy.
Most lesbians would rather stay at home at watch a movie...
take a chance you only live once!
Believe it or not, they aren't.
I like a woman who has some meat but not fat.
my eyes dont do that :)
Yo dog, if you're worried about that...
As for feelings;.......you will lose all feeling in your nose if you say nothing....................!
if it doesn't work, then he'll be gone and you won't have to worry about it.
not that my dad would let me!
It sounds like you already have thought about leaving.
same here im hot still no love
She is straight and I am not.
in any event-give it a shot.
He knows I do not play!!!
Yall both must like each other.
you really didn't give enough information to get a good answer
I've got two kids, so I say two.
Lots of great chat rooms with tons of people actually on cams.
sometimes people get love comfused with sex
she looks boring,way too naif and silly
As long as you love him, then ok.
I dated hot and not so hot and i still didnt find the right guy.
Have even thought about just staying single????
get a time machcine an warp backwards 1 year
Maybe there is another guy out there who isn't too blind to realize what a great girl you are.
You can have sex but should you?????
But somehow I get the idea someone sick is going to tell you.
I fell in love w/ a hot gurl, but I see her holding hands w/ him.
c'mon, sooner or later you'll have to ask him about his status !
One thing like that would be yahoo answers.
IM CONFUSED AND HURT, HE STILL WANTS TO BE BEST FRIENDS,
If she is just an a$$, then there you go.
i havent done it yet but im going to.
there's more to life then we will both discover.
U will know when u r being presented wth some!
no you guys were already broken up werent you?
what was the craziest song uv ever had sex to?
no if u feel its right
(being cute is not very important but if they are... all the better)  just hope this helps ya!
Hope I gave you some other ideas :)
Joe didn't and that is why he is gone.
Don't you want to grow up
once or twice a week..sometimes more, sometimes less...depends on the couple.
Get out now while your young and have a chance to start over wiser...
Hey about my question...any clue where the guys in your hood get their flares?
its really not a big deal, never was.
He wouldn't even give me a chance to miss him.
its a challenge for them so thats why they like you when you are taken already.
Its hard believe me I know
Well they don't and whoever thinks that is just a sexist pig!!
you kno cuz they dont think that they're the s**t or anything.
tell her that in your opinion, her bf is trying to control her and you can see that.
think deeply about what the day really means.
U have to be honest that's better just say xxx u r bad...
I am looking for that real love, like in The movie The Note Book.
you can try cosmopolitian (the magazine)
And watch your back while you are leavin'.
i mean, did he give this to you (a girl, I assume) after breaking up, or what?
If she doesn't like it, F her.
A GUY THAT CAN BE SWEET SO I GUESS THE SECOND 1.
i'm not sure its been 2 years and he still tries to weazle his way back in my life
Tooo late.............maybe you just learned something
so if you find out first it will be better, especially if she does!
Tell him, if not you will live the rest of your life wondering What if... Good Luck!
If he cannot see what an amazing wonderfull smart gal you are DUMP HIM!!
When you don't have to ask.. u just kinda know..
if i really love her i wouldnt mind even if she has 15 kids
we don't want to pay for your dumb a** because you got yourself buntis.
take her out, make her laugh, and have a good time.
PLEASE DON`T ,DO US ALL THAT FAVOR
Probably cruel but hey it works.
he have to don that his self.
Did he really do those things... Do you really want him back..?
its not the best thing  to do.
I have no idea what to do?
Cut him off and don't give him anything.
Now I get laid a lot more and do what I want when I want to!
then the money, the ride and then the H-O-3s lol
save the pic as a .jpg.
try to keep her occupied with other things - help keep her mind off of it..
Second rule: don't do it like in the movie The Bachelor.
because they have nothing better to do but make girls confused!
hips and even a tummy roll are ok.
when the right girl comes around, youll know.
Didn't you just ask this question?
If you have to ask .
that would depend on what It you are talking about
Never buy a chick you just met at a bar a drink.
hell yea man, take that ball and run with it.
girls who wear no bra or panties and jiggle all over the place.
a nice hand made card that saids all the good things about him
hey a friend r one who shares hs joys and sorrows.
Is it so bad to be gay?
i just hope theres not expensive furniture around.
it means that you have never done dirty things and sex 2
...It's more important  - what you think?
no, but thanx for the offer.
You're a whiner... she'll never want you b/c women hate whiners.
I don't want to just give him gift cards b/c that's so impersonal I think.
We're people too, and they don't always exactly get that.
Flirt and see if he's diggin it
A sl*t is any chick that I have sex with.
so to save you self some missery i wouldnt go but its all up to you.
And the kid probably wants to be with his mother too.
cuz ur id is something like seweed69...
yes it is possible to be in love with more than one person at a time.
just look like you know where you are going.
how much money does it have to be?
the way i get guys is being confident and acting sexy!
... baby dont hurt me... baby dont hurt me... no more....
What if the guy that you don't like starts acting CRAZY?
You either love him or you don't.
I hope I'm using it the proper way!!!!
maybe he's not interested and don't want to hurt your feeling
Grow a spine, and quit yer whining.
move on and you will be much happier
this is why we spank it so much .
it really is closer than you think ;)
i don't know how long you've been going out with him and i don't know how angry he gets.
Darcy: I see, and so he came here.
She will never no how much you love her!
keep in mind where you're going and what the weather is like.
and personality - what does that mean?
He is your father even if he did something dumb.
is that a joke or really  a thing??
im great i focuse on passion if theres no passion theres nothing u might as well play chess.
yes, but not a gurlfriend boyfriend one, just a friend one
But if he says Who's Joe?
If you constantly ask a guestion like that then no is there someone else you want to be w/...
For some reason, people always want what they think they cannot have.
Ok so...  Mostly, girls dont' really know what they want.
If you found these snooping, then you are a very insecure person and not an honest one either.
UM............ he's a little kid you can't do anything 2 help he can't even get a boner yet
Just didn't do anything for me.
I know u think u are going insane without her.
the way he acts and treat u
this guy in my school is so mean to me like for no reason.
why not if love is still present then every thing can be solved
One year my wife surprised me with a getaway to the Poconos -- it was awesome.
i couldnt see myself with someone i dont know
Forget about her and start living life man!!
U DONT so don't try love is a wonderfull grand thing try embracing it not defeating it.
try balloons, with  i love you on it or something to that affect, and a personal card
try flirting with them, and if they want you then they might just ask you out.
well what do you think u should do.
You're all wrong except Pete (gr8 name pete!)
you'll never know until you do!
MY OPINION IS THAT YOU SHOULD TELL US WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT OUR OPINION ON ;)
if he don't want to answer your question, he's not worth it.
tell them it is only one twon over that is good news
well there really isnt a detailed answer for true love ya know?
after a week or however long it takes for u to get comfortable, u can meet.
do you even know what your talkin about?
11 years and still going strong
-Love is to tell her how much I like her, how much I love her.
Pretty arrogant, considering they've got the highest divorce rate in the world!
see how hard he looks for you.
im unable to talk to my friends bout this.
He is going to want you to do all the things BIG MOMMA does .
you never really know a guy until you've spent time with them.
i would say when you hit the age of 45+
Why don't you just try new things.
everyone deserves a second chance but this time around be the boss
bite the bullet and just do it
I can say that I don't believe in their life style!
24/7 to cart his kid around.
Just have fun figuring out what works best for both of you.
sit her down and tell her that you are oLd !!
you should walk right up to them and ask them.
telling a joke that wasn't funny and u laughed to it.
there is no way to know.
I mean look at how you phrased it your ex or a boy you like.
TELL HIM YOU THINK ABOUT HIM ALOT AND JUST WANTED TO CALL TO SEE IF HES INTERSED
he doesn't want you to bother him
One is doing all the giving and one is doing all the taking...guess which is which?
yes my girl is a few years older and it is great
Should I be mad or it's really nothing to worry about????
ways to relax and enjoy minutes of the day and you?
I dunno....will you ever ask her to be?
only then u'll realize what love is...
Don't want him to think ur easy.
to make girls fall in love at first sight
it's releving your self of sexual tection.
Thinking with the wrong head lol gets them in trouble everytime.
kissing her like you mean it and holding her tight
is he always in your space or seem to be just as happy walking next to you?
and its turned out greater than i thought.
its okay if I must, butI like to check on developments on this subject
U deserve to be loved... and loved the right way!
No I have not... Have you?
I've liked guys before and wondered if they really do like girls who are hard to get.
The people I see everyday are not my friends they are just another people...
It's gross and makes u seem like an animal, but not in a good way.
sure soudns liek it to me
me and this guy are like really good friends.
get over her or wait till shes availablr
Guys might not think of it as flirting.
try new stuff, lean her way every now and then if u catch my drift.
i really think it depends on contact with the person.
IMADETELLY SEX WITH WOMEN.IT WILL BE OK.
Like I said, just think about and do other things that you like/love to do.
straight up be like hey i really like you...your sweet funny.... thatz the best way in my opinion
go for it...live life on the edge hehehe
If God didn't want you to be gay, he wouldn't have made you that way.
I thought it was bad enough that people were going door to door to push religion on others.
You have got to be kidding?
What is best for me and mine may not be best for you and yours.
maybe the lovers love he moon!
may be your are not pretty at all 'cuz a true crush neva lies :D
get off the computer and find yourself a real (willing) human being to do that stuff with.
No, not for him--for the kids and then treat him special like you haven't in years.
sorry, but im a boy ^_^
let me break this down for you.
i wouldnt do it.sounds like to me he just wants to the money.
If I am with a girl, I am only with her and nobody else.
it is much easier to find a girl if ur not looking.
from the sounds of it, no......y dont you wait and see whar it goes.
Oh, its good never tried... but any lady want to offer me I will definetly do...
Mostly at home with my girlfriend.
tell ur mum to choose for u
if he turns away from you and blushes.
i don't think marriage is for most people.
yes if you want to,but is it right?
sometimes they are totally wrong about their feelings and take wrong decision.
pick the best one out of the fight
at the bootie clubs....you be the judge!
Others have said just go ahead & do it but there are some things that that won't work for.
nobody is perfect...... get used to it.....
Than you probably already know the answer...
if he ses no gust walk away and avoyed him.
Don't worry, his heart will only be broken for around 5 minutes before he finds someone else!
so he kept on asking and i kept saying no.
Are you with this guy or not?
The bags can only hold so much!
Breakfast in bed, lunch in bed, dinner in bed.....or tickets to the Super Bowl!!!
and notice whats on the inside and how big a girls boobs are doesnt matter if youre in love.
sometimes praise him and be sure spent as many time as u can with him.
Depends...some how you should have sex...at least in your mind!!!!
but why go digging in the next persons trash?
Buy her some candy or ice cream.
she makes me feel great about myself and she likes me too!
:)))  So, just be straight and tell him.
my 6 year old granddaughter chats with me ever since she could chat.
try to keep it simple and don't go overboard with skin(you'll want him to respect you).
is like you are attacking everyone!!!!
Don't ever believe you've done something too bad to be forgiven, regardless of what happens.
Think of the movie or novel The Notebook (if you seen it!)
Most of the time the guys that are just messing around are only in it for the ass
if he loves you then he will understand.
oh my goodness, i have this problem as well.
they like to make girls like them
but u've still got nothing dont u?
After u tell her u can tell if she fell the same way.
SOMETHING HAD TO BE MISSING FROM YOUR RELATIONSHIP FOR YOU TO SLIP.
when you cant stop thinking about the guy.
if you find me then you can have a hug.
Honestly...he probably just wants to be friends.
tell him that you might aids and it would be his fault.
it means 3 some.. go for it ahha
i mean u can meet plenty of serial killers at work or at a club.
Incredible simple - BY TELLING HIM!
at d same time i still have my dreams and aspirations.
these days I'm learning new words!!
he trys to hang around u and give u a good look at him.
Do you want to spend the rest of you life like this?
be sure what u r up to.
You don't have to forwarn him, just do it.
It is called a crush and Lust!
Not unless u catch him flirting etc.
there's no way to answer this question.
young is attractive and even though they are old they still have hormones.
y does it only have to be pettite girls    large girls can have good looking husbands
Then out of no where WHAM!!
are serious at all if u're let me know i will connect u
well no is not is yall love dichother is only think it maders
WHAT IF A CONDOM BREAKS AND YOU GET HER PREGANANT!!!
=] They don't want to seem pushy.
they have it so easy and at the same time can look so damn good!
dont look at it like that.
but thats probably a good thing because if not what would we do in our spare time ;)
He's mad cause you didn't give up no butty?
Darcy: No, that's not what I meant.
Because European girls are the hottest!
Ya, I think I do... or so people tell me!
My ex hardly ever wanted to...
Shes a sweetheart and its not the least bit wierd having sex with a girl!
focus on the good you have.
i have loved two women at one time.
go out with each one once and then pick the one you like better.
I am sorry but these are the kind of girls i hate!!!
hell be farting , burping, in the bed and even wanting to sleep seperate from you.
Thats sound like a very creative idea...and reading about her it think she will enjoy it... Good luck
i have always found my wife sexy.
Save yourself those 200 bones and dumb his ass.
And people think she's dumb--how dumb is she if she has her own business??
although, you should tell your boyfriend something.
Can y'all see something I can't??
i'm married, and i havent tried to change my husband.
Not as often as I'd like to!
Astalavista, baby, got me a new lover..
when your adult but when the time is right
so stop looking and the right guy will come along.
what you're talking about is not really fighting.
Don't cheat in the first place!
POEM'S IS NO GOOD FRO BRAKEUPS.
I am the same way and I do not know why
One she has to be a Christian and right with god.
i would say about 8 th grade about 13 is a good age.
The boy can dress.My best friend thinks that I should give him a chance.
Give it up and move on with your life.
because sometimes flirting is just that...flirting.
Just say to her,ILOVE You,then kiss her before she sais nothing...;-)
men luv gadgets .. get him a latest pocket mp3 player
yes if i want i can become a gay.
or what thats just crazy you need to have a talk with this girl
Don't go any further, just let it go.
you seem like a great girl so just hang in there.
one day it seems he likes you he send you some signals.
WHEN EVERBODY'S UGLY AND YOU LOST HOPE
And dont try to define it, just LIVE IT!
Barney singing I love you, you love me...
but it might me interesting if someone get married and then love his wife...
depends on how long really, and how old you are.
Tell him that you like you too!
IT ALL DEPEND ON WHAT GOING ONIN UR RELATIONSHIP TELL US SOME MORE INFO ON UR RELATIONSHIP.
if I'm constantly asking this question...?
You obviously do not trust him and a relationship without trust will not go anywhere!
because alot of girl r on myspace and thay want to keep the girlz on.
Learning grammer & spelling wont hurt!
i make hime breakfast,lunch and dinner seems to keep him very happy.
If one didn't work out move on and have some fun.
It's pretty sad when a 15 yr old puts you in your place...
Find out their phone number,  then add 1-(area code)-(num)-(bers)  g'luck!
Neither... you know he's cheating, why waste your money?
well you have to move on.
so girls, if you want a guy to respect you and take you seriously, don't sell sex.
because if he flirts with u hes probably just doing it for fun.
Because no real woman will ever just flat out tell a guy she intrested.
5.---STOP LISTENING TO ME and tell her the truth.
If you are a guy it means that one of the girls in the group likes you.
Chances are, your teen won't tell you if they are having sex.
That's basically what i look for.
Don't dwell on it, for the rest of your life needs living, so try to focus on that.
smiling giggling i would know im a big flirt!
kiss her neck and ear and whisper words to her.
=D Good luck with your love life!
ohh and also remember that condom are not 100% always good and you may get her pregnant
yes you should but only if he deserves it
maybe  maybe not seeing you are a guy unless you mean lets go fishing  then I would love to...
Girls know this and they watch to see if you're nice to the guy she's with.
wow u must be  small kid... lol its ok just be gay!!
honestly couldnt tell you but if you have to ask things may not be going so well.
Guys always want to have sex
even if they think yur boyfriend looks weird, all that matters is that you thinks he looks good!
A babysitter (if you have kids).
and if you think she is cute DEFINITELY do not!
I THINK IF YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEBODY THEN WHEN YOU ARE TEMPTED YOU CHECK YOUR SELF.
make alot of eye contact and smile when she looks you way.
everytime i like go up to him he looks all happy and so thats why im not sure.
I hope things work out for ya.
Just have to say - hey!
take the pic and save in a folder u no.
No need worrying about the past?
IF BY CHANCE YOUR BOYFRIEND IS A CHRISTIAN THEN FORGIVENESS SHOULD BE EASY .
marriage and relationships are not supposed to be like that.
Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
2 years older is not bad.
im in one right now, and will be for another 5 months.
if you cheated on him then why do you want him back.
he probably thinks you like it and it makes him better in your eyes.
you do not deserve this and realy neither does he.
u have to do everything from ur heart be true to her.
i hope my rambling on has helped some.
wait till marriage for sex, hun.
to take their bad and their good all the time.
will telling him now make him move away?
and yeah is slang for yes.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM.
i don't think that there is someone better looking.
36 B .TO A 36 C .
I find it hillarious when a guy TRIES to look sexy.
I also love a girl what can I tell you?
Go get an STD test you ho.
No but why wouldn't you just buy the cheaper one that looks exactly the same?
And are you sure that she is?
now we see them in the shower at the gym.
You only get one chance at doing this thing called life.
I don't know what to do..
we all know when a woman is interested in us... ;)
yea,sometimes they look for a girl with breast  or a big butt...
let me reitterate this one: NO.
probably 15 cos shes gonna be a little mature but is still very sweet
if you two are serior i say 3 months ...if not that serious.. you decide
HE NEEDS TO GET INTO A REHAB AND GET CLEAN.
I know you are a smart girl.
If he does...he isnt worth it
Hey man... girls are those interesting animal different (very differents) from men.
why'd u ask if ur gonna be skeptical?
Now, don't you go messing with trouble.
If she wants to just cuddle... then just cuddle... don't get all pushy and horny on her.
Remember that you care about someone.
That's like asking, Do u like black ppl?
Take you a little feel too.
because they a losers and nothing better to do with but hurt girls.
ive done it be for and im finally with the love of my life.
but until then i might as well becasue i ain't really doin it so.....
just try to be a sweet girl and ignore him some times.
:P  I really can't explain it.
keep trying new things and if thatn doesnt work ask her her wuts up?
is he too old 4 u?
EDIT: Here's sort of a nasty trick you can do.
Be your most charming self and be sure you give her sexy eyes, and if she flirts, flirt back.
Day and night, why only one?
Look at your question list, dolon, you're pathetic...
sex does get monotonous at times, but we try to find things to liven it up a little.
If you cheated on him then I don't blame him for being mad.
find out if he likes u, ad if he does than ask him out
Just tell her, you are 21 and your own person.
do you think i might be making her nervous?
i knew it when my heart and brain went numb
It's not going to get any better
Trust me, that ought to make him happy!!
OH GOD yeah....umm, you can exceed the norm for how kinky you guys are used to getting.
sex is a beautiful thing embrace it.
When I see a girl all slutty, what else would a guy think about.
maybe because love isn't what we expect it to be.
She is crazy if she doesnt love it!
Because of recent happenings in my life, I find myself single and alone again at age 51.
Uh...you are to young for me!!
what trust does she have with this other friend that keeps you from i guess dating her.
1st ask yourself, why did he leave?
Divorce him and get on with the rest of your life.
yeah my boyfriends do a lot.
no sense crying over spilt milk later on.
my crush has odd taste in shoes, but i still like him a lot.
maybe find someone new to ask out
so i sent him and e-card saying mommy, this monkey follwed me home.
w/ guys or he tells u.
guys dont like to be crowded
he is on his best behaviour
the craziest song was chicken head um that was the only loud thing we had
See you are what i call... a bad guy.
if you cant talk to him now how will things be in the future?
First you have to be completely sure your doing the right thing for yourself!!
please insert a real photo since you're a real person
down there if you get my drift.
IT HELPS RELEIVE THE PRESSURE ON YOUR TUMMY.AND IT'S A WONDERFUL POSITION FOR HITTING THE WOMENS TWO G SPOTS.
There really is no way to tell if a person is being honest with you.
just talk to him make him laugh alot,thats the best way to flirt.
now were just friends, but i still like hima nd i think he likes me.
BUT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING OUT WITH A GIRL IT IS OK.
i like to do sex after lunch and after dinner .
this means that he really wants to be around the one that he cares about.
she was not looking for nothing at school,and there he was!!!
tend  her to talk to u.
16 and 21 is a big difference.
Forget her and start hunting for a better gurl
What girl could say no to that?
because you're a jackass trying to sound like a gansta.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT?
God bless and hang in there.
or check to see if he wears a wedding ring.
eHarmany.com I heard was really good my best friends mom met her fiance` there
IF YOU REALLY CARE FOR SOMEONE,IT IS THE WHOLE PERSON YOU CARE ABOUT, NOT JUST WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.
he is in his mid 40's.
think on that for a while.
me and my fiance are freaking out.
No even if you and her be friends for thirty years.
You go girl :o) Hopefully I find a nice guy someday.
a good cry, a good drink, and a good friend.
don't do it...its not worth it !!
did you ever think that she wriggles out of it because she doesn't want to go out with you?
i mean would you take a mexican guy over someone else?
Thats the way I see it
I see its all about his child, but him going around you to his EX.GIRLFRIEND!
i used to have a bf and we broke up.
i need someone to go out with
I get the feeling like wow, where did that come from?!
just because you cheated on him doesn't mean he has to get mad at you,does he?
It gets you no where, it drives her away.
say you are being a little too clingy
romantic guys aren't always the best!
Interesting....  And I'd have no problem watching brokeback mountain, just not with my dad.
U just tell the grrrs, It's small, but it's cute ;-)
How often do you ... you know?
(not a phisical fire... dont burn down your house)
beg her to forgive you and understand her if she didn't
Let him marinate with someone else cuz obviously you cant produce.......No disrespect
can i learn to get past that and trust a woman again?
Guys are forgetful too, you know?
I definatly don't want one in my neighborhood...
Hey this is just a womans perseptive.
shes a f**cking lunatic and controling and whiny.
he doesnt deserve the money, afterall you have been buying all the baby stuff right?
Stick to the girls who like baseball & beer, they are the best ones!
hey 2 points is 2 points
but if you want more, don't be afraid to ask his status.
he looks exactly like my cousin though so its kinda wierd!
from experience i can say.... because of the relationship with the childrens mother!
Two years is too long to wait!
When you always do what the SHE/HE likes.
please tell me what !what is love
Would be real great to meet and make friends with a gay guy.
Have fun and if you wear lingerie for him, he'll NEVER leave you!!!
Honey, just because you are in love doesnt mean you should try anything he wants to try.
Why would you want him if he doesn't want you?
He makes a total fool of himself around you...
don't worry your not alone...i just don't feel to have a commitment right now...im so busy to my studies...
Don;t be surprized is they do not confide much once she starts counciling.
is he full of crap and scared to admit his real feelings or am i just tripping?
TELL HIM THAT YOU DONT HAVE THE SAME FEELING AS B4 JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH
Don't wait until things get worse.
I say Chicken .. or rooster for that matter!
i just want her to be happy.
you really are no good to yourself, your kids & your wife if you stay.
She's your wife you should b w/ her.
Unless the girl is really enjoying it then time will not be a factor...
not something to fall in and out of so fast.
It's like me trying to be a lesbian when I like men so much:)).
If your man is doing this for you, he is into you....
I personally don't like it very much.
They want someone who is smart and funny and...!
when true love is involved then color is not an issue
And no matter how much I fought that fact, that was definately the case for me.
if that is ur name, sure.
When you always think about someone.
for some people marriage is a mistake.
He just knows you like him and you are an easy target.
their personality, and if they flirt with me while siting on my lap when stealing kisses with me.
no not if u feel like it was the right thing to do
They probably don't deserve you anyway.
NOT HOT AT ALL HE VERY CORNY NO I MEAN LAME
i could really use the advice... he's been my bestfriend for threee years now.
seriously a car is nothing,I don't have one!
Heck, some people might actually live there still!
Some girls do, some girls don't.
I DID THAT DANCE IN GRADE SCHOOL AND IT WASN;T HARD TO LEARN.
he//, im 12 yrs old and im dating already
But gurlita as soon as i am outa highschool im gone!!!
don't think about it anymore, go get help.
1.he becomes distant from you 2.he dosent compliment you as much 3.he blew you off!
i think it is cause i do
I say just walk up to her and ask her out.
I worry she's on drugs or???
i would not mess with karma.
Hey I have been married for 3 years and want to spice up my husbands and my sex life!!
star to looking a new want gall,
You will be ok, keep your head up!
tell him what you do want, and keep the conversation going from there.
p.s if u wanna chat email me
if u give a guy everything he wants and he still isnt happy maybe its time to move on.
if ur cheap, a card,some flowers,hug,and a passionate kiss.
Boyfriends come and go Best friends are forever
You have one and you shoul hold on to him.
it will only make it worst.
i'm like feeling deep for this boy.
so i kind of felt bad.
TRUTH ME IF YOU PARNETS DIDN'T LOVE YOU THEY WOULD BEEN PUT YOU OUT.
I have always like that one....
So why is life so tough?
boyfriends come and go your true friends will be there no matter what.
NO IN THE TIME OF NEED YOU NEED YOUR FRIENDS.
I am an old fashioned guy.
Bullsh*t. I am the anti-domestic women, I guess.
your girl friend is just being picky right now.
He probably wont say it back because you didnt reply with ilove you as well
question back at you: would you respect a girl that isn't hard to get?
never hate when you hate it drags you down
Just be yourself an if he is the right guy he will soon be yours.
YES, CAUSE HE SOUNDS LIKE THE FAKE TYPE
but i don't know if he's over me.
true be care full what u wish for
I mean sex is good I just want something different-----Any suggestions??
mabye because she still get over u and she at leat wants one memory of u
:)that is why i am dating eric:))
im sorry you have to deal with that.
means  you feel the need to have sex
probably because you dont feel a thing.
find a new boy and make your ex-boy jelous
So if you don't love her, be honest with her!
I never kiss a boy before.
yes and i waz so dumb 4 that 1
sometimes alone time is the best way to know yourself ( what u need and want).
you are getting sloppy seconds and the other womens problems that he did not tell you about.
But, life goes on and you  have to MOVE on.
it sounds like you are just f@#king... if you arent dating then i recoment to stop having sex.
give u r partner id i will ask and tell u
you'll find some one that likes you for you.
But not enough to give up the attention she gets from keeping guys like you around.
i dunno, it's nice not worrying about bills and rent, but it's also kinda getting old.
hold your breath and lick there ass....seriously
But like i said not all young women date young men they do like the more mature ones
no matter how long i would wait.
i met my hubby in a chatroom!!!
he is hot,funny,and smart.he is just my kind of guy one problem,he's sorta a player.wat should i do?
well my first kiss was last year.so yeah 15 years old.
you can't make someone love you
some people are just scared of the d word....  DIVORCE!
talking to people on the internet is like talking to a mystery peron.
Good Luck Hope I helped a bit
i was with my ex for four years.
Like the guy decides to get hooked up.
I have felt like that a lot in my life...
If ya'll can work it out then no.
I don't know, that girl sounds like a flake.
I don't want a simple answer...like it tastes salty...explain that to me.thats a homework question ppl
So just roll w/ the punches and just dont call back and get a new girl.
Oh - and my husband and I will be praying for you and your marriage and your children!
hug him with his waist ,put your lips on his lips /cheek.
And, by the way ... BEAUTIFUL IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG!!
You were blind like most men because us women expect you guys to read our minds.
Do it only when u r in good mood.
A good lover will want to please you first..no matter what.
just follow along with what he's doing and you'll just be fine....
Maybe he's gay think about it carefully.... lol c'mon on the butt?
Thanks  (Our house is up for sale now)
to get her back just apologize to her say some phrases or give her some flowers
Do what you did in the past.
so never think of another man or women in your life.
I wouldn't care if my boyfriend (If I had one) bought another girl a drink.
aside from the fact that they could be called queen mother.
YOU HAVE GAVE HIM CHANCHES BEFORE, GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
do it once in a while.
I don't ever do anything about it.
it depends on the mistake, pray about what you have done.
Unless the both of you are divorced, I don't see the two of you hookin up.
well if u want 2 have a girlfriend, why would u ask in da internet.
i like girls that are fun,active,and doesent smoke.
YES, I CAN THINK BLUE BUT NOT ONLY ME EVERYONE CAN THINK BLUE COZ EVERYBODY HAS IMAGINATION POWER.
Well, you ask me, but the answer is NO!!!!!
Yah.. sometimes i think blue because I'm very sad Don't worry, you're normal!
Keep me in the loop of things and let me know how it goes, good luck and have fun!!!!
no.. my bf is younger than me.
Go all out if you want to.
Maybe you'll be lucky and she'll want you!
Most people, sadly, don't realise the difference between sex (the act) and love making.
if i had a bf whop was cheating on me its common since!
here is info: (reunion.com) this site help people find long lost person
Move on and you should not have moved in with him...  keep telling ladies this... don't believe me.
spandex n a muscle shirt lmao
You give me hope for the future...
def pretty face and ok body
I am dating a guy that is 25 and I am 28!
girlslike to talk a lot abou them selves.
this wnt help u at all
My advice would be.... 1. go to counciling on your own.
perhaps they really are virgins, or they just dont want to get a bad reputation.
Thats if you lived here in NC.
try getting kermit if u don't think it's to dumb.
see u gotta tell her some time or the other.
sure, may not be healthy but *hit happens
fantasizing in an inapropriate place, say, um, church, for instance....nasty.
I know a few 'gay people'.
if you really love her you won't.
yes love hurts i do not care how in love you are it just really hurts .
She likes me as a friend but not as a boyfriend.
Go slow...if a guy or girl is worth it, they will not rush you.
since i started the longest i've gone since then was about two months
but i don't know if i should make my move or what.
A good reason to wait until marriage!
Unless you like being in bondage...
I think the girl above named Cindy is so right on target...
Not every girl give out their #
and i thanked him for helpin me sort out another bad seed.
totaly,loves her is more like it
No 'cuz I'm a straight guy.
find one you're interested in and ask her.
No offense... but are you drunk.
If he smiles and looks at u.  he might try to start a conversation
Have you done anything to make her mad?
(due to a severe car accident, semi-truck hit me head on!!)
I get hints that he tries but he never does.
Don't flirt with everyone, or else they will think you are a whore.
..because life moves on and you can't dwell on the past.
what did you do to lose her?
FOR EVERY WOMAN IS A MAN
But a young person (under 18) should not be kissing anyone!
But I would think sucking a cock is nasty!
It is definetly ok to want to be pleased.
get rid of the guy, there's no true love there
Hot guys are out there but without intelligence and a strong mind they mean nothing!
and valentines day is coming up and i want to give him something.
i don't think nationalities should be in question here.
not good eventually it doesn't work out.
Generally, guys do not find it attractive when a girl asks them out.
tell them the truth, be out right and forward about it so theres no cunfusion, this sounds pretty serious.
Micheal Jakson doesnt sleep dont you know that?
I never give out my number at bars, if they ask, i always give them a fake one.
if you r then its perfectly natural if your not then i suggest seeing a doc.
home is good but dont you want great?
i do everything for my bf and i get nothing in return
Was I supposed to just get over her?
It didn't work so great back then either.
As long as u love them and they love u then i dont see why not!
Can I buy you a fish sandwich?
u have to ask urself...  is he worth it?
Because you gave them to her.
What is it men think s hottest?
I can't seem to let her go...
(Assuming you dont really KNOW the guy)
Well even good women get hurt by men too.
Hi how are you I guess nobody is online cuz theres so many questions without answers.
don't worry about those kind of guys, just be yourself and you will find mr.
dont leave him out of your life.
U have to try practically.....asking out here in Answers will not help.
Ya need to Change things, don't accept what you have now.
not that im asking her to marry me.
I heard it is even sexy!!!
hmmm.... do a lot of housework!
sure..if you don't mind the military lifestyle
That weak little man that thinks he needs to hit you to feel like a man needs to GO!!!
Be real and tell her whats happenig...Don't lie because the things may get more complicated!
Now he is going out with aother guy.
you must be bad in spelling or you must be so high
I wanna marry, not just date.
you already know the answer to this question.
but I do have a old truck for work!!
So at school I flipped him off but didn't get in trouble.
well thats easy if he doesnt love you just break up with him.
CONGRAT ON YOUR NEW FOUND LOVE!
Either way, it doesn't really mean she's interested in you so what does it matter?
If you're up for the adventure!

God fearing men is the best guy!
MY THING IS,  WHY STOOP TO THEIR LEVEL AND GAMBLE WITH YOUR MANHOOD/WOMANHOOD BY CHEATING TOO?
he got me a plush doggy.
When she gets older would you want her to stay with someone who treats her like that?
he didnt say anything after that.
if you are a man love on your wife there is nothing that beats that.
will you play doll house with your kid?
It was the way to go, no stress at all!
So why can't i get a date????
Is not working out once mean I should just move on?
she says that she do that because she talks to other ppl online .
buy a dozen white roses, then put a single red rose in the middle.
And it didn't cost me a dime, just a little of my time.
wow id have to say.... around....17 or so?
Anyone who cheats on you is not worth it baby or no baby.
the cute thing is that i only got him something and he only got something for me.
then just ask her to go out with you.
Yeah thats fine but it does mean something.
be kind to your self you have to live with you no one else love your self.
IF that doesn't work...maybe you should break it off.
i like her and she does me.
so is that cheating or not.
if he wants to divorce his wife anyway...i think you should tell her what he said to you.
BECAUSE BOYFRIENDS COME AND GO FRIENDS ARE FOREVER !!!!!!!!!
Cause y'all ask for it;Don;t ask like u don't want our # anyway.
DAMN, no wonder I've been cranky.
Hot bodt with an ok face.
But just make sure you do it in person... over the phone or online are NOT as special.
A BACK STABING BAD FRIEND= WITH FRIENDS LIKE THIS WHO NEEDS ENEMYS.
A WOMEN SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT, LOVE ,TENDERNESS .
every one does at one point.
even if you're shy, you can still ask her out calmy and joyfully.
i am studying it at skool damn somebody done gave u a std.
If you have had sex, you are not a virgin... ...if you haven't,  then you are.
I still love her after everything i have been threw with her.
if you rilly love them then your never to old.
GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE,IT WAS NOT MENT TO BE.
younger boys are immature, just to let you know.
no , letter are great they express love better anything
you just have to go talk to her, i know how hard it is beleive me
Hell yea ur a lil too old.
Umm..its depends if you both really like eachother then YES all the way!
My grlfriend caught me talking 2 my ex ?
You pick guys like this for a reason.
Not everyone is like your wife.
You just have to know that he's got your back no matter what!
even though we haven't met face to face were both in love.
as long as you want to..........there is no set time.
but she is soo great to talk to and I don't want to hurt her.
We talked about it and I got SO excited.
THAT COULD BE JUST WHAT SHE'S LOOKING FOR.
Why don't you just ask her!
Dumped the guy, dumped the best friend & I haven't gotten that close to another woman since!
No, definitely color has nothing to do w/ great marriage.
it shows she is comfortable with you.
You have sex with her while she's sleeping??
A team or a club or a gym...?
because its in our mind....other than that its like a jog in the park.
it seems u r hot !
Do what you want, just stay away from my man would ya!?
1 the fact that he has a car is a pretty good start
I would think I was like a hero
1 n 3 open her clothes and then have sex with her
But maybe because I have black hair also.
in most cases, once a cheater always a cheater,  think, before you jump again...
don't be mean,and don't do crazy things!
it depends the person u want to love, if he is a friend then don't mix it with love.
when u r ready to continue ur life   dont rush urself but do not wait forever either
hey boo, let me keep it real if she loved you then she would show it all the time.
An emotionally broken man finds it impossible to come up...
of course confident.. no need to explain.
just be cool and dont try to act like you got game.
do what you know is right.
i love you doesnt count during two occasions.
be your self a oman like men that arent a fake my friend.
:)  (PS - We've been dating for going on two years now, so it worked for me!)
tell your guy to GET A LIFE!
ISN'T THAT THE KIND OF WOMAN YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE?
Go to England and ask one out?
Either way you should get this checked out.
fat or thin, it's what's in the heart that counts
give her clues to how u feel and if that doesnt work than u should just tell her.
to love is loveless unless u love yourself.
Can't do much more than you already have.
Cool down .....he would be just like any other guy.
also u don't want to rush back in with bagage from the last guy( u know?)
hey you can't wrong with the date sampler of dinner and movie.
in other words,if it works for ya'll,then ROCK ON!
Ask him out the same way you'd ask a black guy out.
michigan is the sexiest state in the us.
Im feeling like that right now with my  girl friend.
If i liked someone i dont think it would matter.
If he broke up w/me-I'd keep it.
what's in it for him, will you sign a pre nup ?
if your too nice people will pick up on thet and abuse it.
they will now be on time
even more if the girl is goodlooking.
Don't do it men lie a lot.
stand behind her and play with her hair, girls like that!
#1. if he accuses you of cheating, u know hes messing around
Yeah why not... just don't get too wild.
what stailive missed is that its not beholder it's beerholder
are the symtoms of falling out of love.
And DONT talk to you ex if you arent over him yet!
Ask him if he really loves you and why hes hittin' on other girls?
Ask him what he wants and give it to him.
Y would 3 b so bad?
It's just something you feel together, hey!
Why stay in love with the one that does not care about you or love you in return?
girl you should break up wit him because he proalbly has girl on the side
most girls cant stand cheesy unless its creative and cute.
he is the sweetest chachito EVER!
but thats nothing todo with you.
girls like a guy who will admit he goofed up and apologize.
i CAN TELL YOU STORIES WITH HAPPY ENDINGS AND STORIES WITH SAD ENDINGS.
PICK A QUIET PLESANT PLACE,WERE YOU WON'T BE DISTURBED.
Why is it that when I finally find love there has to be somthing in the way?
If she really loved you she wouldn't ask.
i think about him all the time.
love ya lots like tater tots!!
any day  for sure not problems
nah, it's got nothing to do with pride.
i have so many love names for him like : corazon, amor, taquito, chiquito, bebe, papi, etc.
be a friend unless you have romantic interest in him
stop sucking dick and start eating pussy
If he cannot play it straight, then he is not very honest is he?
THAT WAS AN EXAGERATION BUT ALOT OF TIMES.
:) and in teams there is no room for selfishness.
Girl don't let him control you!!
Unless you have kids and she isn't ready for that yet.
Stay strong, you can make it!
Well for me it does not exist...
i really do love her ..
it's only gentlemen like to do so.
then, depending on his answer, dump him or don't
THEY LOVE YOU.. THATS WHY YOU LIVING WITH THEM OKAY THATS SHOWS TRUE LOVE....
make sure she is not racist
when i was at ft benn.
If you can affort it try jewery (necklace)
Then you go out and cheat on him?
if your his gf then tell him that he is clumpsy in terms of sweetness and caring!
I can't tell you but it lasts forever Oh!
I think its normal, most guys think about sex alot too.
My friend asked me this and I told her to dump him.
If you aint gettin it somebody is
Tell your girl that you need girl time with her without guys around.
how can i know his nature & how can i know dat if he really loves me.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SHE IS 3 OR 2 YEARS OLDER THAN ME.
depends r u on your period?
most women don't have a high sex drive until there 35 or older.
Just say to yourself outloud in a crowd of single men......NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!
when that's broken it takes much time to heal.
whta is this world coming to ?
There are some women that I can't imagine with anything but long hair...and it looks delicious!
no i would not resent the person being late.
Well for me its outta there, whoo livin on me own!
just b urself if he doesn't want u then forget about him.
(I have a recipe for spicey meatloaf if ya want it)
Remember, guys really don't like girls who are easy, they just use you.
Spend your money on a therapist, okay?
Unless you're married and have kids, etc...
like do u think she will be willing 2?
BE NICE< BE THE CLASS CLOWN AND JUST BE FRIENDLY!
if that fails, just ask him out (go w/ something simple like would you accompany me to...(a funeral maybe?
BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER TO RESPECT THE SPACE THAT SHE IS ASKING YOU FOR.
i think its bad ,because i have had one .
nope i think black&pink because blue is so old already almost everybody likes blue!!!!
If you feel theres no hope what so ever then fuck it.
He only does it now at my BEGGING maybe once every 2 wks

IF UR IN SCHOOL, I SAY, IF U CAN LIVE FREE.
Maybe go to the beach, or something fun like, I don't know, miniture golf.

change ur pace every once in a while.
i think there is no true defnition of love except this one love is love
my girl friend was..Hurts like hell.That's why i never trusted best friend anymore
He's still youre dad and he loves you no matter what.
i like the way a person carries themselfs
over and over if you had too, love is worth it.
Why don't you just tell them you are saving for a house?
I dont like bars or dance clubs that much.
it's not good to hate but it depends on wat he did?
then make it a goal to say something, even if its only hi, every day.
my  husband and i have been seperated for 5 months.
(these gals just emailed me their numbers!
but don't froce anyone in this realtionship.
Best of luck finding your father!!
tell them to go somewhere and then burn your house
Otherwise, I found myself hanging out with the guys wasting time.
maybe you mean to, maybe you don't.
I mean... Is that his best physical feature?
also ask for her number and email.
Ask her what is the deal between yall.if she says gust friends then leave it is.
but if it was just a friend dance then its ok.
You're BEST FRIEND or her Boy friend?
find adventure with other people because you both are not happy of the adventure going on between you two?
you aren't going to loose anything.
yeah sexy and sweet.... i bet you like to lick and suck on the toe.... lmao
Above all good luck and have fun!!
I never saw her after that.
what is it someting  u did or r u just new to a school  add some details
i slapped him on the booty and he smiled .
well since i started the longest has been about 6 months and that was only because i was pregnant
you should tell her you never know she could just be saying she is straight she could be lying
only if this girl is ur gf...  she is right??
So now you play the waiting game huh?
if she rejects just make out with her and get a room.
make your family proud of you !
please don't stop reading because of that comment.
ok, well you could either wait for him to move back up  where you live.
so roll the dice and ask him instead of us.
!or just have a friend tell him.
only black guys and italian guys are cute.
if i was paid like 100,000,000,000, if i didnt get paid NO
star,  It depends on the woman!
The answer is very simple...Not only CAN HE, HE WILL!!!!!
And plus her mouths right there if she wants to talk dirty LOL.
AeroSmith agrees with you in their song: I don't wanna miss a thing
not on yahoo i can tell you that
Ask him and see what he says.
So u SHOULD of broke up with him.
he has already got a new girlfriend.
And I need some one to chat with.
you should just see how things go when he comes down.
You want a good man with morals not a hot guy that has nothing going for himself but looks!
how to get your man back
if he mean it he'll say it again just keep doing what your doing
No no no I would not .
see if she works out of it.
I say that you dress up like Hilary Duff and kick his ass.
if he loves you he will change his atittude!
Whatever u and your mate compose.
Or maybe Match.com or something similar.
Why don't you talk to her about it???
no, there is nothing herbal you can do to make it bigger,nature gave you all you will ever have.
how long have u being go out wit her?
platy games with my ex wifes husband, the one that wouldnt think about fooling around onn her
but dont cheat cuz that will hurt her even more.
i prefer older men myself  more mature and usually dont play as many games as the young guys
if you both like each other and want to make it work it can happen.
wow is this me ur talkin about?
we kissed to day but i held back some was that right?
a warm beach in the caribbean.
I feel like i cant trust.
do not even try to notice them and they might notice you
well depends what do ur other friends classify themselves?
Just remember thisL  WHEREVER YOU GO THERE YOU ARE.
(I cant stop thinking about her sence then) What should I do?
GOOOD LUCK ON GETTING HIM GURL.
Find some other guy to fall in love with.
remember that they were usually in war.
dont just say random things that spout outta your head.
because you don't know why the ladies don't like you, so you can't fix the problem.
we are both in our 40's
The one that makes you both orgasm the hardest.
I LOVE THE FLAVA FLAVE SHOW.
You are a little bit too young to be kissing or doing anything else!
i dont think you men realize what mental abuse is or know that you are even doing it.
I am a guy and I work from home.
Brad Pitt got pregnant Angelina while divorcing Jennifer...
so it wud be i love some one very special.
ID SAY AFTER HIGH SCHOOL I MOVED OUT WHEN I WAS 16 IM 21 NOW
I did not care about what others in school was doing
and try to amend your ways i mean your weakness you know yourself.
after all they are the ones who give birth.
I know it sucks, but guys need to make the first move.
and ohh give her white roses on valentines day, they are really romantic!
She may say how am I?
Take care and you will definately be in my thoughts!!
Did he try to get back with you during that 5 months?
like the best to contact her...
what things can you say or the places you can go
Dating for fun is just stupid.
I am pretty sure he doesn't have a gf ....
Depends on which f-word you mean...
it will mess up your new relationship and u will be right back to the begining.
should i even make a move on him or not???
no, not at all - let him know how you feel
it happend to me and... here i am - married 4-1/2 years.
If all else fails... chocolate is always a good backup (with strawberries is possible)
yes, my cousin is gay, and she's honestly one of my best friends ever!
...and can we using masks ..even for good goal?
then have at it...  you'll be pleasantly suprised.
it's really about the way of thinking & not age...
I felt the same way she did.
( he is gone two weeks at a time.)
However DO NOT TESTIFY ON EITHER OF THEIR BEHALFS.

I never liked him i liked his friend.
Be yourself and if that ain't impressive enough then the man has issues!!!
give as much response,dont know what to do
And I don't use cheesy pick-up lines!
bEST WAY FOR YOU IS TO MEET WITH HIM IN PUBLIC DONT BE ALONE WITH HIM.
THEY DON'T LAST LONG AFTER YOU LET THEM BACK HOME.
maybe he knows and just doesn't find you attractive so he/they sidestep the issue.
So you have a lot of options...
Don't give up snowboarding for a guy.
Well, since your shy, and she's shy, go to her tommorrow.
Either he just can't hang or your putting to much enfasis on sex and love.
if she's okay with it, then NO.
I did it once with my girlfriend and it was awesome!!
I'll go for the pig answer here....Breasts, legs, and butt....bigger the better on all 3
Ask him what he wants - then give it to him.
Of COURSE it would be a big mistake!
YOU CAN ALWAYS BRING THE MEMORY OF YOUR OLD FRIEND INTO YOUR NEW RELATIONSHIPS...GOOD LUCK
be straight with her, that is what most girls look for in a guy at least i do.
I've answered at least one of this guy's questions not that i'm jealous or anything-puhlease!!!
I found mine on the internet.
he is also either playing or really self centred and rude!!
Don't worry you will find the right guy.
Its called family you'll know whenits time to move on.
enjoy time with your family while you can :).
please tell me what to do..
i would 1st cuss her out.
LOOK IT UP IN THE DICTIONARY IF YOU ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT KNOWING WHAT LOVE IS!!
i definetly would if i was horny.why not?
could have just been pillow talk too, dont make a biggie out of it .
but remember to be nice to the girls
Think about boogers, toe fungus, my mother-in-law.
some guys not but others i think are hot
no it just means hes cocky and wants to play games be carefull that way you dont get hurt.
your probably holding your lighter too close to it
Also guys dig chicks who like games.
You know, don't mind about it that much.
Don't let your wife off the hook!
WRITE HIM A NOTE, ASK THE QUESTION ,DO YOU LIKE ME WRITE CIRCLE YES OR NO
If the guy you are with cares about you a lot and loves you- STICK WITH HIM.
um.. it depends do they both no you love them and someone else?
maybe you guys have some suggestions for me...
you ask them to marry you.
IF U DO I  AM SOO INTERESTED IN TALKING TO U CUZ HE IS THE HOTTEST PERSON ALIVE
and for christmas he came down to az to visit and gave me a diamond ring.
or he may just come out and tell you.
If he liked your friend he would go out with her.
Because people don't always marry the right person.
Why don't young men like older women?
mine stays in the house :)
When that happened to me I went straight to my friend.
he seems like a nice guy stick with him.
but if they kick u out hen sorry they still love you though!!
way of wearing rings or something like that.....
No i think in purple, its more loveable and happy not so...depressed
victorias secret if not long.......and if money is no object-take her on a weekend get-away!
i think i know what ur getting at.
Hell ya girlfriend be up front and honest.
its not tough- it just does not go the way we want it to go- big difference!!.
I dont date anyone younger than 17.
just whatever you do, make sure he doesn't cheat on you!
SO WHAT CAN I DO ?
No; cause if I flirt then you better believe that he was flirting with me first.
if a guy isnt ready to say he loves you there is nothing wrong with that.
Then she came back to me sayin that she didn't want that guy anyway.
but there`s a lot of confusions as we`ve never seen each other...only n photos & n web cam.
hey if you really love him explain to him that being mean to your friends is not right.
he is always up looking at the boys on their pijames
he's being chinsy and in the process being dishonest and very much not a man at all!
We have big arms, sexy bodies...jajaja.....yeah right!
no u can't date while ur getting a divorce that would be cheating and its still wrong
thatnx for the anser on the one aboutthe guy thats older than me!
pissed cuz she's telling me she aint worried about me trying to get in her panties
tight boxers is a lot sexier!
if you love them more then that has to be the answer right there
that is such a COOL idea!!!!!!!!
my neck, lower back and thighs.. hehehe
I suggest you just move on...
but i wouldnt want to have to wait
when it comes to emotions guys just dont show it.
and get your way with the real person.
mabe it was him an had no other way of tellin u that.
it thkes trust on both sides.
HAND UP POSTERS OF THAT ERA IN YOUR RECEPTION AREA.
Its not all on the girl, tho.
maybe best to just give it some more time and see if he shows up
Well I tried to give advice...=D lol.
And maybe they will be good friends
cheat on him..duh .have sex with his best friend
write her a letter if ya dont feel comfortable.
he is so o.m.g darn adorable!
look her straight in the eyes and and have a kind look on your face.
i'm so glad u asked this question
what celebrity would you like to sleep with??
Therefore, we like sex a lot!
Good luck and I hope it works out for you!
for me you should teel the truth
it took me a whole year to admit to my friend cherry and myself that i felt for him.
you just ended up with a wrong guy.
when I liked a guy I sent him a valentines day card.
Well your lucky dont sweat it.
it depend on the girl's nature
it's not what u get, it's what u give that really counts.
Girls like that only want one thing: Money.
Like asking if they need help.
yes.when ur having sex ur inside someone and it feels as if u two were one.
Treat them like they are the most special woman that u ever met.
But dont listen to all of dragonfire.
and before i let you go let me leave you with this.
or how far would u go with a guy?
it'll be hard but u have to get over it.
now i am confused and dont know what to do!
the answer to your question doesn't lie in me or anyone else you ask.
Is he just fronting, does he really care, should I just leave it alone?!?!
do you look at her differently does it make her less classy than you originally thought?
Which is scarry coz I think he's almost 9!!!!
Why don't they move to be with you??
i don't know did u ?
Why on earth would you buy an ENGAGEMENT ring for an EX girlfriend???
That is when you are a legal adult
a good marriage counseler can help.
If you're making out heavily at 13 have fun with a baby at 16!!
Why can't someone be just mine?
no we are all freeks online
And he is everything I have ever dreamed of!
Not saying it's a great thing but THATS LIFE.
my gosh,i hope you realize what a great guy you have and don't cheat on him!
If you love that person, then, yes.
When you feel it coming on, slow down and think about something off subject.. like drag racing..LOL
or they must using mask to have what they need & want ?
mmmmm.... looks at me and smile and look down.
YOU SHOULD REALLY TALK TO HIM OR MAYBE HE IS NOT READY FOR THAT KIND OF A COMMITMENT.
watch dvds with him alone and by the way i am18
stick your tongue in their dookie shoot
if they're such a good friend, why r they tryna get wit your man in the first place?
By nature, they are the ones that guys want.
we have been together for 3 yrs.
didn't get to know eachother before hand.
Yes... if you are a man.
don't choke and skrew up your words.
i would call that a fony friend.
If that's the case, hells yeah!!
But really, whose business is it anyway?
I LOOOOOOVE wearing my hubby's tshirts and sweats.
go see the doctor and tell them that.
you would have to categorize this question to ever get a real answer.
Yeah, Hope you know him, i mean is only dating.
try sexing without  1. thinking bout it 2. listening to it 3. thinking bout it.
People change....if its been ten years, he is NOT the same person he WAS.
so what should i do ???
If you did not have sex, well then your are still a virgin.
or are they just seeing people?
he is probably a player and not worth ur time anyway.
Keep it clean I wat to know not get kicked off thanks!!
my sn is JvLmRive 4 aol so come talk 2 me
It's stupid to throw away your friendship.
Our three month anniversary is coming up and i dont know what to get her (she likes frogs).
(sarcasim) And Thats Your Valentines Present!
sometimes when I just sit there and watch my friends go crazy!
So just ask him if theres any chance he like you!
u feel the samething at the sametime.
But dont be too cheesy, just keep it real.
but obviously you're not getting what you need.
you apologize with some flowers and you tell her that you love her!
and now , we talk on line but with less reply from her .
YEA IF YOU DIDNT HAVE VAGINAL INTERCOUSE THEN U ARE
Most boys my age don't even look twice at me.
Baby girl if you are under 15 you should consider your education and goals before a hot guy!
its probably already happening, you just don know it
um ya this is deep so id say them or u ur self & i
well it depends what the truth is.
well maybe a little but it takes time that is the point i'am making.
Just means he wants himself more than you want him!
maybe set up the bar like the old speakeasies
Ask yourself these questions: Am I happy?
yeah i was and the guy broke up with me because he said he doesn't like long relationships.
Your optional answers only leave me to believe she's a blow up doll, so...   3. have sex with it.
when we are happy we forget everything.
you have to ask him and let him know you like him!
if all else fails you can always talk about it.
maybe because of your president behaviour toward the world ....
Girls love REAL not phoney stuff.
If you aren't helping him, then you are a part of his (and your) problem.
It SO depends on the girl!
2 of them already have a family.
Oh and remember, BE A GENTLEMAN!
if the boy or girl is flirting with you constily giving you hugs andgiving or send you love notes
Talk bout stuff she can get into.
if you have bumped uglies, then you are not
I guess you should make your selfesteem stronger... HOW?
a friend of mine he was my blockmate for one subj.
give your bf time, just because you say it doesnt mean he has to.
They had a really great marriage and he loved her dearly.
My son asks, why can't my dad be like Bob my husband.
(though my family seems to go senile at age 8 but still) see what I mean?
I guess she really wasn't my best friend was she.
thats going to be hard...have you talked to your best friend about this?
If that doesn't work, smash his computer to bits!!
nah i really think in tikny colours haha
I usually say Hey there sweet thang.
Remember BOYS DONT WRITE LETTERS, THEY PROPOSE.
When guys wear boxers, they look like little boys.
sometimes i think that some men look for a woman to treat them bad.
But if they are 40 and 43 then ok.
ya i have the same prob.
ALWAYS KNOW THAT A WOMAN NEEDS TO FEEL AS IF YOU HEAR HER.

U should buy something very special tht she doesn't have.
Dont sleep with someone like that!
Yea.. i'm myself when I am around her but I want her to see me different, have any ideas?
it will happen when you least expect it to  :)
It's all or nothing with me!
And for gods sakes, buy a guy a drink every once in a while.
i think most boys find the internal beauty of a girl at first you know what i mean
stay with him if he is the one you want go for him.
i have to say my wife will never get out of the nurseing home.
A guy is either great, or a jerk.
if they will leave the relationship because you express yourslef then it's not worth it.
and if he did it once he has enough power over me to do it again.
go out there n look 4 some1 special.
DO NOT DIP YOUR PEN IN THE COMPANY INK!
I AM GOING TO CHOOSE DAM&DUF BLIND WOMAN
my youngest brother is 9 years younger then me.
WHY NOT GO TO YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL AND GET THE BAND TO PERFORM SOME SONGS?
I have a special little unicorn my husband just loves.
he proposed me & i agreed.
because all you will do is eventually spout hate.
What can I say I'm just blessed?!?
But we became friends anyhow and that was it..
and i love nature......butterflies, flowers, trees all that stuff
time flies when your on yahoo answers
It sounds like counseling may help you two, alot.
Then ask a girl to have sex with you.
On a bed, in a bedroom.
Ghosts, monsters in the closet or under the bed.
no, maybe he just want to have a conversation, or his buddies aren't hanging out with him that day.
YOUR STYLIST WILL KNOW HOW TO DO IT, ITS FINGER WAVES AND COMBED OUT.
Don't worry about it or give it preamble.
11. i had my first kiss at that age
SCAREY MOVIES I HATE THEM TO THIS DAY
Even straight girls can fall for tomboy, you know.
Ok.....leave it to me to throw a wrench in the question.
And once he finds out, how do I get him to be with me?
this is the best i can think of.
food and the most romantic music.
lets start from there so do that home girl.
Maybe you should be asking, Why do I want to know?
(sorry, I got a little crazy for a second there)
If she is in a relationship with him already, just leave it alone.
give me a freaken break here.
if the sex is bad leave
they also like to get flowers and secret letters from an apologetic guy.
What should I do if he has alot of pretty, popular girls with him already?
Maybe her boyfriend can't or wont go for some reason.
If we show any sort of sex-drive we are sluts, whores, ect...
how does the other guy feel about you?
But when you actually start meeting, things gonna go bad because they see the real you.
Just give him a phone call
ALOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SPEAK ON HOW THEY FEEL WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE.
and of course he will do it to you.
Get married when you're ready, don't let them pressure you!
Men like to watch their women get off.
Her girlfriend is pretty cool too.
find somebody else don't waste your time for him.
i would just tell her how sorry u were and just start making out with her
one line advice is WIVES SUBMIT TO YOUR HUSBANDS, HUSBANDS SUBMIT TO YOUR WIVES.
and since the sex is crap, then you wont be tempted to jump back in bed with her!
I just recently told him that i had a crush on him.
not if her boyfriend is around or a jealous person =)
ah yeah ...don't forget to swallow
To each their own but why ?
Just start doing things that will keep your brain off of him.
ask him if he is a good friend
If you give up what you love to do for a guy that's pathetic.
She has started TALKIN' to that guy.
If you help them no age is too old...
yup - if you are into BSDM
ok girls like it when u make them seem special so mostly tell her duh.
hey waz up everything explanes me exept collage
just do it live as the nike slogan
Or maybe (and we hope not!)
i dont care what anyone says love is never lost.
Well I guess I will see ya.
tits ass and vaginas, duh, oh and mouths
first of all do u think someone did something 2 u while u were unaware?
That is if you reall yalready know what you want
I didn't want ask her e-mail for one reason, cause I wanted forget everything that happened.
If he'll cheat with you, he'll cheat ON you!
i am  so as was.and behave better with her
4. if all else fails move on, their are other microorganisms in the cesspool.
I told him to get over himself and think about how THEY feel.
you've given here everything that she needs but have you ever thought to ask what she wants?
We didn't see each other like yourself but through pictures and cam.
When you think that way, guess what??
so they get mad becuase they don't feel like they can so easily.
Also, men mature later than woman.
depends on what you mean by phone relationship.
i`m really tired of these women that think if your not thin or tight your a joke
first of you arent a screw up.
I am not a candy, I am not a whore, and thank god I am not a virgin!
But be assured it's not always the woman!
in other words my entire life
If it continued I eventually would tell my friend
If he did, he wouldn't have cheated in the first place.
Most guys are just users, once they get there piece it's off to the next.
man would choose what they eyes can see woman choose what their hear tell them
for all of that and more!
-txgurl -------------- true love is when you don't see the your spouse's faults.
if a guy stares n 2 ur eyes 4 an hour every night what ALL is he thinking about
TO GIVE YOU SOME REAL ADVICE, TALK TO YOUR WOMAN MANNNN!!!!
beautifull women are all around u....just look...but hey wot kinda beauty are u lookin for?inner or surface...?
u want to find lost friend?
Don't be afraid boy, just get out there and get it.
You'll feel like lightning hit you!
once you both mature a bit you might just end up back together again.
How u appealing him and how fast he recognize u.
how she shake her hips and turn her head
You know ask her what a girl like you do for fun on the weekends?.....
it's never gonna happen cause guys hate desperation.
ISNT IT AMAZING WHAT MONEY CAN DO?
even though he says that he isn't afraid???
Unless it's on the cheeks then go ahead!
some do but not all anyway
it's never gonna happen cause guys hate desperation.
ISNT IT AMAZING WHAT MONEY CAN DO?
even though he says that he isn't afraid???
Unless it's on the cheeks then go ahead!
some do but not all anyway
If he can't do this, then file.
Yea, Because we usally have sex
YES I WOULD ID EVEN HAVE SEX WITHHIM
i dont think it does that much but to some girls it does
If yes why, and if no why not.
he tells me i'm crazy, sweet, and beutiful.
Wear cologne - girls like a guy that smells good.
Because we don't want our friends to see with and ugly girl!
Don't jump in head first before you get your life back together!
that's beastiality... i think blue is better suited for another dog...
just enough fat (if u will) to cover the abs.
I think boxers look like old man underwear.
i won't call anything that has to happen should be.
if you are his friend then surely you must know his home address.... go there and get the latest....
Now he is acting completely not interested in me, saying stuff like  I used to love you  ...
If you are really sure, cut her
do u think she likes u?
So common that I couldn't call it weird.
those are the signs of a guy who wants a relationship.
Why don't you try asking her out, maybe watch a movie or something.
but when the guy calls you dont answer/return his phone call...what is this!!
Not sure if still i can marry her.
(she should return your stuff tho, unless you told her it was a gift.
and are low enough to want him to leave his wife.
and be smart that is what i look for in a woman.
so just go for it let him know.
because the violent femmes said so.
you need to go to counseling with your husband if things are bad.
I realized I did want him to be a part of my life.
Girls like when guys ask them out in person.
Men are like dogs, you hit them in the nose once, and they won't do it again.
I don't do the other way, it's perverted, and I'll do almost anything.
how can i get him 2 say yes
what do you want to do??
they loved their mothers so much.
I believe that my hubby & my sex life is better now than it was when we got married!
it dont matter how old u r u just kno when the right time is
Just as with guys, women come in all shapes & sizes.
whoever says yes 2 u, theyre just playing.
I wouldn't call that person a friend at all.
Millions of girls in the WORLD!!
for virgin girls out there, well done!
no thats not nasty but thats not somthing that you want to tell people
yeah you just have to be careful
it's been 3 yrs, and I love him to death.
is she truly your best friend.
all you have to do is 'tell' you r wife that you're worth husband to live with !
YES YES YES YES AND ONE  MORE YES LOOK AT MY CASE.I'M SORRY HOMEGIRL.
but i must say blue does sometimes look better on other things than other colors .........
I dunno.About 21 or when u finish collage
yep, it's normal and yep, guys like it.
i think you guys broke up for a reason.
Well buddy it sounds like shes a very critical lady!!
Now I told yall about the boy I liked so he came by my house today.
tell her that you and her both need other friends too.
not all are jerk they just have to step out from behind ther egos, and grow up.
Yeah, it is nothing to shy away from
Enless your like 20 and the other person is like 15 then thats not cool.. Just my opnion though!
at the end just point the bed and you know what to do!!
i think in black and chrome!
I u are doing it fast and feel like u r coming, then slow down a bit.
no, most of them are really ugly.
Not many good ones these days.
to meet ladies to get dates , to hang out
love or crush, for that matter defy reasons.
my next wedding will be a spring wedding outside with lots of flowers on a beautiful lawn.
if you want to ruin your relationship, go ahead
This girl I know the sex sucks ass.
dont date the sadist tell him to fuck off
more on silent type or the active one??
Sure if you are in love!
your never too old to live your parents.
Do you think I should tell my guy that I am going?
Chocolate and diamonds... or you could just do some of the little things that she likes.
But do not run so fast, you are too young
get rid of anything that reminds u of this guy.
Even if you don't date until you're out of school, who cares?!
pray and when it seems like he's(jesus )not listening pray some more i ve been there
I would proly get tired of it
If you don't feel right, then don't do it.
Because if he WERE interested, do you THINK he would act tired?...Nooooo..
yes and id like to do a foursome with you in it
dont let it get to your head.
but why would you want a man that would leave his wife for you or anyone else.
MAYBE HE HAS BEEN HURT BEFORE AND IS AFRIAD THAT YOU WILL HURT HIM TO.
dont lose that, its nice to have.
i say tell him the truth and hope it flies!
I'm kinda shy at first but once i get to know someone i'm fine and am totally me.
cause they hate being proved wrong!
there a ton more guys that you can obsess about!
you say when you fell from heaven.
depends on how long you have been dating!
with discipline and strength, if you really love them give them what they want, a leader  answ3r3r
If u r realy like that as u mention, u 'll definetly got ur desire.
Or you can break it off totally... but mainly, think it over!
you dont have to though if you want to go for a long time wondering if he does!
it'll be so much fun than before.
Girls aren't blind we see alot.
you seem to lack self condfance .
The girl he likes is my best friend?
and if he pulls out and says he didn't know the condom broke, then thats crap.
Then your just going to wait until your older maybe then she will like you!
nothing wrong in trying.many are their for fun, you will be one among them!!
I'm married and I only see my wife twice a week... when I have too.
Yes, I love blue, but I also love Hot pink and Lime green!!!
But if she doesnt like you.
dump that trick she dont desevre you
You might want to tell her if she doesn't.
I say you should cause there fun and u get to travel around the world
It hurts though, especially when that person likes someone else, and shows it!
is now married and/or has kids.
i beleive he's cheating on me but i don't have proof, just a gut feeling.
You know the answer is HELL YAH, DUMP HIM!
Don't use a coat hanger lol
don't be shy to answer this question
Also: Just because somthing is legal does not make it right.
Hmm...well, he knows she is an idiot, right?
..... girls are candies ,,, the cover is virginity  :-) be a virgin
GET HIS A** CAUGHT CUZ HE IS A DOG!!
IF HE FLIRT A LOT W/ U, AND IF HE PAYS A LOT OF ATTENSION 2 U.
when you feel kiss , you kan kiss  .
Guys have short hair girls have long.
EXCUSE ME MISS I CAN'T HELP TO THINK THAT I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE
Stuipd answer me if u know wat I mean
i'm a girl i'm in this situation
Make eye contact and just be honest, funny, and flirt alittle (not to much)
basically tell him u feeling him and feelings are uncontrollable so what next?
because, in a sense, it's ok if a guy sleeps around, but not if a girl does it.
hoping to see her msg in your e-mail,sms,etc )?
go 4 it, and ask him out
try as ahrd as you can because one day she'll talk again.
who knows ...... slow down and take it easy!
drive her to the top of the building in a blindfold way.
whoever u think, don't others chose ur bf
The bridesmaid's pay for their own dresses!!!!!!!
once my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend and i told him 'ok were even'.
I can't tell you but it lasts forever When it's love Ooh, when it's love Hey!
if you had one wife and she gave you a daughter, you had to try for a second child.
it had nothing to do with lust.
But If you are comfortable there and your parents dont mind then sure, why not?
actually, when you start asking this question.
i say stop fighting it and flow!
share you feelings and see how she feels.
Then get on one knee and appologize.
My Boyfriend is in Iraq and I wanted some Valentines day gift ideas.
as long as u still like eachotehr thats all u need in a relationship.
Just in case is Just what you get!
it isnt tough love, love or what ever.
you just need to forget about this guy.
People don't even know what Love is.
Don't need a woman for life, but a woman to keep me company
i feel like a screw up.
kick hubby to the curb if it isnt working out....BUT dont run off with this other fella just yet!
if he flirts with you flirt back, you may just end up getting together.
the way i see it love and friendship and love are all the same.
They obviously like you for who you are (which is great).
time to get out and be independant.
talk to him, then if you guys get to be good friends, then tell him you like him.
Just wait for her to come back.
where can i get some porn?
F buddies or friends with benefits type?
Because we think different about a lot of things.
Trin I hope your not a girl....
See I don't think men are one or the other.
DO NOT change for this guy!!
ya im kinda going through the same thing.
Friends don't give friends a list of demands!
Im not jealous or anything i guess.
hey i'm a junior and i would like to be ur pen pal.
Say....... You want some of this black booty .....
u cant b concidered hot till 17 before that your just cute
I like brunettes with long, soft hair
as in crap i cant put it in words
Say no.. Geez.. some of the silly questions people ask.
no it is not right....that is so sad.....
I like brunettes with long, soft hair
as in crap i cant put it in words
Say no.. Geez.. some of the silly questions people ask.
no it is not right....that is so sad.....
if u dont change every guy ur with will just use an abuse u.
if you really like the guy then make an effort and hang out
well, i'm going thru the same thing.
NOW IF UR NOT IN SCHOOL, I SAY U NEED TO GET OUT THE HOUSE.
You don't want your man back.
8. they want to be mean becasue they think thier husbands are mean.
Go with the flow, man... Good thinkgs only come around once in a lifetime, maybe twice if we're lucky...
basically, if they do start dating, you will just have to get over it.
I left Home the day after graduation but that was because I had a job oportunity...sort of.
20 yrs but I do have plenty of BOB'S {Battery Operated Boyfriends!}
Sweetie, you don't have to date anyone you don't want to.
Small Island in Hawaii on the beach during the day...!
!and makes the kissing more exiting...
girlfriend,you have to ask him how did his dad let him go out with that girl and not you?
Blue says i am thinking your crazy with this ?
Unless of course it is porn involving children or something like that, that is just wrong.
Is it nasty to fantsize about su*king co*k??
so im guessing he really cares about me.
AFTER YOU TALK TO HER, GIVE HER TIME TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS.
but if u r nice sometimes then i wouldn't say u r a major prep.
He not doing all the things he use to do before.
yes, hubby's clothes are soo comfortable!
the worst is he doesnt but he probley does.
I give it 2 thumbs up!
to be caught with an ex on thin ice could very well break it....
see what you have in commond and if you dont have anything  in commond it doesnt matter oppasites attract.
i wouldnt let him come home for a little while but i would take him back.
Read this book, it will really get you ready for love!!
she set me up with her nurse.
if he loves you hell respect your wishes when you tell him your not ready
don't brush her off just because you already told her you want to break up, be more considerate.
If you break now it's only gonna be harder.
I SAY JUST THINK MABE YOU DID SOMETHING TRY TO REMEMBER
as for telling him you liked him?
because  women are always whining about something and never shut up!!
i am hear broken because i also love and care for someone who lives so far away.
Because good men are no challenge to women.
but.... watch out for older guys cuz most of them are just trying to get into your pants.
Or do you just NOT want to yet?
I mean i have a nice butt and legs, and i'm not overweight or anything.
BRING HER SOME EXOTIC FLOWERS,LOOK IN HER EYES AND TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL.
If nothing chages tell you're best friend.
when you love someone you dont act fake just cause your around your homegurls.
He likes it at home He's not ready I'm hurt (and i'm ready!
Oh my goodness it is crazy that you asked that question.
Don't let him get to you...
other than that everything is good?
I am in a boy in the eight grade and I like my friend.
Be happy you got a guy in the first place.
Don't listen to those that say just give him a chance.
im 17 and im dating a 21 year old the gap aint no problem u go for it
Yes that happens to me all the time... it sucks
and everything will would out great in the end.
but we live it the way we can.
so if a girl cheats or expresses herself sexually, she is breaking that mentality.
Average, big, huge, or What is that thing ?
Briefs all the way!They're so sexy.
and dont date a guy to get over another one.
hell yeah if ur a guy
that a guy is interested in you more than just physical?
yes i feel hurt but i only flirt wih guess who flirt first
Good luck,  Captain Blarg, online freak.
Truly, unless you know for sure that he's a self-centered bigot... JUST ASK HIM!
i want to break up with him because hes mean to my friends
personality, intelligence, and what most women refer to as the poo-ch aka the belly.
Oh yeah and it is cheaper.
Ask him if he have someone and if he say no then ask him out.
that is STUPID 2 say that u are hotter that ur girl friend!
The guy has to come to the girl first!
Just look at it this way.
Good Luck, keep your head up!
just approach her, conversate with her, see if ya'll hit it off.
I'm like really smart and i'm not hot, but i'm not ugly either.
Go to dating sessions if your that kind of guy (or girl what just saying!!!)
I dont want to flirt with her, i'm interested in a sincere relstionship.
just a little  but they are still fine
Wow, this guy is a real ass!
...they're more important to you than you are to them?
So.. it all just deepends on what kind of guys you like.
ur kinda love is so unselfish n i would respect it more...
i have never had one work i advise stay away frm them
i always had him in my heart,you know how it is with your first true love,am i right!
u might want to make sure he's ok...aka alive?
I mean, Hell the guy isn't even creative about it.
He wants me to kiss him.
Come on... you don't want a girlfriend, you want sex.
You should tell him what you want...not what you don't want.
if a girl does it, she's a ho or something, if a guy does it, he's cool.
How can I get her to like me?
that is a good thing to hear btw.
So how do I tell if he likes me or not?
or if you mean the none-perverted way... with salad tongs.
if it was from something you messed up on you're going to have to appologize(and mean it).
not rock hard abs, but not flab.
just confident, honest and careing wish u a good luck.
i don't know what you all asking unless u feeling sad but blue is my favorite color
18 if any older your a mommys girl/boy
But i've been with older women, and it's been great.
it depends if you really want to meet him.
I totally think that that is the wrong answer!
when you are in love with someone you dont have eyes for anyone else.
should i just wait...or move out alone?
heck no he might be strong in all but he wont be around as much
who cares what other people say, as long as ur happy
Do they like girls who are always flirting, or only do it once in a while?
You need to meet Rosy Palm & her five friends
friend are suppose to stick up for you , not for there partner.
(sense of maternal pride kicking in - i don't even know you!
well, just accept the love that's avaliable.
get her a stuffed frog wit a heart on it, or something that combines love/frogs
YOU ARE EXCITED AND CAN'T WAIT TO ENJOY
when you stop asking that question.
Because.....he wants you as a FRIEND and nothing more!
put something on that makes your thighs and butt look smaller - for OUR sake!
it all depends how the relationship is going.
just tell her exactly how you're feeling - just try to be nice about it is all.
2) Join him and whoop his ass in the game.
do nothing.just love him as a friend and nothing else.
i like nice, good personalities, stuff like that.
Many guys look for a gal to support THEM!
ps:my mom moved out when she finished high school.
mostly females are weaker than males, that's why men don't fight with females
Guys come and go, don't let this one ruin your friendship.
your too young to be that hung up on a boy.
no matter how mean he is to you , never hate !
no keep it to your self they dont need to know
i dont think so, it to soon!
i know...its wierd, but i like it.
you cant help who you love...your heart decides
just ask her  wat she thing about it.
i can;t call to say such a thing.
by the way im 17 and so is he.
of course if you let him try.
EVERYTHING..  THEIR LOOKS THE WAY THEY CARRY THEMSELVES THEIR INDEPENDENCE INTELLEGENCE
Do guys like that in a girl???!
I guess it's a nerve that all girls have!
No, it's not love in any way, fashion, or form!!
You deserve more than that guy.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
it burn when u pee it's be cuz i  think u got gonnrea or something.
I think he does cus I hang out with lots of girls but not neccissarily the ones I like.
Never open mail from someone you don't know!
Don't be yourself... you're a dork.
ask him like you would ask anyone else.
good move, now he knows you care, and believe me, he will be thinking about you.
Are u planning to spend the rest of ur life with this person?
dont make it short chat for a bit.
i wish you the best of luck buddy ;)!
She and i are still friends and I still love her truly madly deeply.
then he asked me where i live and was acting like he liked me!!!!!!
when it comes to family the women have that.
when she asks Did what hurt?
I know this isn't real in depth, but I hope it helps!
BE YOU AND USE YOUR STYLE
also when your first with someone its all attraction.
i am sorry i dont fit into my girl's clothes(lol)
WHAT I MEAN ITS HARD TO TELL ITS TRUE LOVE UNTIL U ARE AROUND THE PERSON.
Just think English royalty or Liz Hurley, act like that and you're golden!
Naaaa just get even and cheat on him I'll help you in that area :)
if he really loves you he'll want to spend the rest of his life with you too.
I DONT KNOW I HAVENT SEEN IT.
The best of life to you both!
everything that you do with him might be romantic for him and vice versa
You where like way off topic.
At least this way you have 50 percent chance for happy :) Good luck!
Depends on how well you know them and for how long.
my ex-boyfriend is friends with the guy i like.
2nd NOT tell her anything any more.
WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU LOVE AND YOU ARE READY TO MARRY
my wife is in a nurseing home.
my ex-boyfriend is friends with the guy i like.
2nd NOT tell her anything any more.
WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU LOVE AND YOU ARE READY TO MARRY
answer it ,,, and its not sace our ship
my wife is in a nurseing home.
And alot of people wonder how did u do that when u are so young?
Twice a week is seeing someone a lot.
But be extremely careful so that you dont get hurt.
did i say thinking bout it?
HE IS THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORD ITHOUGHT WOULD HAVE A REALITY LOVE SHOW.
You can do it ... :)
because he already got a lover: his playstation.
I think its because men are more co-dependant.
perhaps some and some not .
Good Luck to you both....should be exciting and fun...once ya get past the door.
Remember this, always do the right thing and it wont haunt you afterwards!!
Don't worry about it, your going to grow into it.
I Guess No...    Becoz everbdy wants Change..
Hope the date went as you hoped
i think guys prefer long hair.most of my guy friends prefer a brunette.
Okay, here is the biggest shock to a young man.
only one man is worthy of the pleasure of deflowering you and it aint your boyfriend!
or u could go to las vegas or reno, and win her a stuffed frog.
no why he broke up with you
u say ur sorry and for valintins day give her a bunch of sweet stuff,like rosess,and coco
Tell her flat out and get on with it.
trust me youll find someone to treat you better.
love is not easily tempered either
;) I imagine your quite popular w/the boys!
But they do not want someone that reminds them of their mom.
i personally would not go outside of my marriage.
HOW  TO  HAVE   GOOD  SEX,   HOW  DO  I  GET  HELP
does your man understand you like this new guy.
so that u can enjoy the best
Dont do it because he wants you to.
U wont believe it..  Its all about the MONEY factor.
The man can tell, the woman probably can't.
There are better questions to ask - just so ya' know!
Men don't plan to cheat on women.
I don't know anyone who does.
Resently I've met the most charming & nice ,sweetest guy every in my life.
may be she likes us and want love from us.
Have you ever met the phone guy?
say it just the way you feel it dont mince words
That corny old saying is still true: It takes two to Tango
Love knows NO boundaries...  We're all just people!
Finding this out the hard way sucks.
try your best and if she cant seem to appreciate it t is her fault, not yours!
4. looking at it you'll go limp or dry up...try it!
You my not be freaky enough.
Some guys like me, some guys don't, and some guys are intimidated by me.
It just, well, didn't feel right.
I FOR ONE LIKE TRUTHFUL MEN.
at 15 you realy should not be dating.
you have to tell your best friend
do this while laying down (NOT naked, clothes on, on a bed or couch).
what can you do when it feels like such strong destiny?
can you tell me how to kiss him
if you know it's going to get physical, then don't kiss!
Hope you get some better answers.
Don't get too down over it.
i dont love my now husband anymore,too much shit happend between us!
and yes alot of guys do like that in a girl.
YOU COULD ALSO TELL THE GUESTS TO DRESS FROM THAT PERIOD TO GIVE AN OVERALL EFFECT.
i never seen her sleep.her= my gf
he is coming to see you.
Last but not least, you need to spend money on her.. dont be cheap.
hmm...  is she into that type of stuff.
ok im bi and i would nvr do that but if u feel u have 2 go 4 it!
it could just be getting boring.
What types of flirting do guys like best?
are you a democrat and he is a republican.
So , girl , take time ...
Swinging is a very bad sin!
otherwise you will only be able to hang out with him alone.
finally, why do women make better nurses than men?
Basicly, I look like a fairy tale princess.
how do i start a conversation?
umm lol hes probly not a slutty bot!!!!!
i can call u a father in your family !
kinda hard to tell there except for the bonding comment.
when you focus on making your self happy the right person will come along
besides at the end of the night..
Don't think enzyte will make you manhood bigger.
then he has to be able to trust u in gettin married.
WHAT DO U DO WHEN THE MAN YOU LOVE CANT STOP STAREING AT ANOTHER GIRL WHILE YOUR WITH HIM
im on a fast need to know basis!!!!!!
your her knight in shining armor sort of speak.
Girl if it was me he'll be missing for doing something stupid.
1 the fact that he has a car is a pretty good start  ROFLOL !!!!!
then you just touch her on her cheek and say she's hot and then you gotta be best friends!
well, i see you as a challenge... and its a good thing if a girl likes a challenge.
but don't leave him for this other guy.
secure with bobby pins going in a cris cross pattern.
Last night his parents brought up that they give him permission to move out with me!
If you know the person is cheating and where, etc.
technicolour is cool beacause it shows he real me in the way that i like.
Go out with your friends for an all Girl's Day!
you don't want to lead her on or be mean about it.
He talks to other people (females) like nothing jokes with them ect...
get rid of the moron before he gets dangerous!
Especialy if the other guy doesnt even notice you.
you can leave when your 18
u only live once and std  is not as serious as it used to be.
Money is not always the issue!!!
trust your not missing anything out hear trust me , i just got back in the game myself.
Talk to her about what she likes.
If they are the rebound guy then tell them that and enjoy it.
.. or you coudl find that out the hard way ..
do u think thats anybody deal with us as really what HE or SHE is ?...
try saying do you want to go out it works
3. look pitiful and make sure she knows that your life isnt goinng on w/out her.
I HAVE NOT BEEN AROUND EITHER OF YOU TO SENSE THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN YOU TWO.
try walking in the neibourhood, you won't just loose weight, you will also be more active.

I always hear people say they like Europeans more?
To top it off, my name is BOB.
hehe/ in love, age really doesn't matter at all.
if not tell him to back off.if so, dont try to steal him.thats fucked up.
I don't mess with men that are already taken.
show your best efforts to put up with it !
i met a guy that i really like, but i'm still married, what do i do?
How can you even stomach this guy?
so he wants her to disconnect their relationship with eachother.
I think as soon as we get Bush's head outta his bush... then equal rights will be just that.
i feel lonely when my husband goes to work.
Believe me, its well worth the wait!
loving the person in spite of their faults .
And it is just more proof that I am his!
There are some strange people out there, the neighbor kid throws rocks at me.
Ask you're self who you like better.
I like the way they always try to look there best, but i hate when they over-do it
oh and if he is helpful
it  can, if u let it to.
if you're too shy and won't ask her out, you will eventually not like her anymore.
How do i tell her how i care about her?
I dated a guy 10 years younger.
do you think he likes me?
We will be married for 5 years this July!
I even like talking to him.
Now Im 23 and Im back.
Rad Dr. Phils book Smart Love.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN A PERSON HEART AND I DON'T KNOW BLUE OR YOU .

i think she loves u veey much but she can't express her feelings in good way.
getting too badly burned if the feelings aren't mutual?
Angelina Jolie in a heart beat!
its just plain weird to ask in code?
i think u should move out when youre 18 before u go0 to college
just be confident AND no pick up lines!!
I don't konw if you should dump him or not?
as long as you are a good person it shouldn't matter.
why can i not have legs like that??)
haha.. yeah.. everyone here is perverts.. so becareful when you say that...
Ask him, I'd bet he feels the same!
All guys flirt with girls, if they don't, they are abnormal.
not every guy wants a dependent girl....
but the policia will look at you with beady eyes.
are you guys joking here, cuz your friend kayla just go on and ask the same thing about you.
i am kind but, i need female friends
let her go.. she only come back to you when that guy leaves her..
maybe that will be the reason u finally get over it.(5years?!)
There was a reason you got the restraining order and no do not lift it!
Don't let one idiot discourage you.
I like the bend and snap
No kissing on the first date, it's better not to rush, than screw things up right ???
just a kind of psycological curiosity.
im liveing proof , what dont kill you will make you stronger !
it does happen all the time.
I just think that is funny.
the first person that I kissed ,is my husband now .
same ol song, but its true  he must be the ones thats lonely fallin for a star
Not really sure what you meant by this question.
i wouldnt mind u suckin my cock !!
i don't see anything good in that r/ship
Anything, I was and still am a wimp.
no she's cheating on him evidently.
and there's always someone watching you.
But I never thought he would come out and ask me to have an affair.
But you don't have to do it that way if you don't want to.
even have reocurring dreams for months at a time.
Then, I would ask her for an opportunity to romance her again...dinner, flowers, dancing...etc.
Now all you have to do is just do it.
Whooo hooo lock the doors baby!!
And if you are a real woman, what a thing to say, LMAO.
yeah u can kiss someone with braces even if u have braces
!I've found mine and we're engaged.Yay me
why men hurt woman who love them
If a guy says, if you ever need help, just let me know what does this mean?
I don't see what the problem is, girl.
No dont let him come home.
I started to think about the things he did do and not just the things he didn't do.
i think most guys like long dark hair,but if they really like you it's wouln't matter
why would you want him back?
For instance, I WILL at least LISTEN when the ex wife says hes a real p***k.
You should start dating when you are mature enough to get married.
well duh if he smiled then he luved it and you played STA?
be a man and go get her!!
Or when she says, I love you, you reply (or something similar to) I know.
Don't become another Victim of his!
no honey that aint love thats just a man being insecure and an a**.
Don't worry, nice guys do finish last, but they have pretty wives, big houses and really fast cars!
WHY DO BOYS CHEAT ON GIRLS AND GET MAD WHEN GIRLS DO IT BACK?!!
With friends like you, who needs enemies!?
beat 'em if that dont work take things away from them.
if they don't say they r preps then thats y they r calling u a prep.
No worries, being single is much more fun =)
at times people have to choose between their love &   best friend.
JUST BE YOURSELF AND ENJOY LIFE.
IT WONT WORK AND IT SUCKS BECAUSE USUALLY ITS ALWAYS MR OR MS PERFECT THATS FOUR STATES AWAY.
If you can work it right, then no need to worry about the size.
The cartoon Gummi bears and piranha gave me nightmares... so did the chipmunks movie with the wild boar...
Train your family not to ask you.
ask a few questions to your best friend.
yes, but weed out the idiots first.
u dont want 2 feel trapped when ur around her alot
I'm guessing that you mean Brittish?
If he truly loved you, he wouldn't beat you.
Spice things up, GET HIM INTERESTED!
I wouldnt call her at all!!!!!!!
I want to get this girl but I want to flirt around.
add details and ill get bck to u on that
if just for fun go girl!
You don't, life is not that simple.
Now, this guy told her he couldn't go around wid her.
just tell him straght up it's over period
there are men out there who LOVE sporty girls.
have you ever thought that MAYBE they are really virgins???
IF he doesn't like it, move on to the next guy.
Every guy that I know, complains about the same thing!
tell him u dont think he loves u...
He never gave up on me.
RIGHT when u least expect it.
Also i try to get back at him everyday but he really likes my best friend now which sux
MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN AND SHOW HER THAT YOU ARE LISTENING TO HER.
I think it would be a big mistake !
why is it he cant take the chance and be with me?
Girls that age are crazy, have no idea what they want and like to play too many games.
does he flirt with u, pay u alot of attention, calls u and act funny towards u
I dont want to stop bieng friends.
eighteen is whebn my parents will kick me out.
If you would be comfortable with that, then go for it!
The one that makes you talk to the Lord, you know like Oh God Yessssssss...

ill just mail it to him.
Long Distance Relationships Never Work out!!!

U can find love at a stop light, it all depends on cupid, love is blind.

This would work on me: Hey, you wanna go have a drink after work sometime?

It sounds like you're picking up on his i'm  interested signals already.
yeah my friend likes someone that 4 years older than her i think crazy but three it alright
why not go ahead and sleep with everbody u can while u can.
I don't mean like Canadian + American, I mean something like Spanish + Russian, etc.

So just do whats right for yourself and start over!

I can't tell you but it lasts forever Oh!
If he says not than not to worry you will find other guys you like.

but of course regardless of what you decide, be nice about it.
Not really you don't want any of that making her boyfriend jealous heat do ya ?
that is not a deal breaker for me.
don't ever change yourself for some dude!
when you are so close..yet you feel so far away... feeling careless..
depends on how much of an age diiference there is and how old you are.
so you best bet is make sure it's what you both want and feel.
she needs all the help she can get leave her there
i dont think u could of asked a harder question to answer.
last valentine's day, i got him a soccer piggy bank filled with chocolate hugs, adn kisses.
If your parents do not mind and you enjoy it then forget everyone else.
So I say forget about her
so i say do u're thing and don't even bother for protection.
Trust your feelings, if some guy seems creepy, THAT'S A HINT!
he is probley just scared that he cant please you like he wants to.
so many people do now, 50% of married ouples divorce.
there are other ways, but that all i could think of.
nobody wants to date an unattractive person
I am a good looking man (ex model and still in shape), but....it's happening to me too!!
my friend asked my best friend out & i need help
Then in december she broke up wid me cuz she started likin another guy.
TELL THEM YOUR CHRISTIAN AND WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO CONVERT.
The day I Married my best friend, my wonderful husband David!
then he said: u have beutiful eyes and we were staring at each others eyes.
they are like eyes looking at me.
ask her in your own time, though.
dump him now before its too late.
tell her straight and if she says you are weird than she really isn't a friend.
all positions if u have hard erection.
I met a really nice girl last summer.
Oh, did he help in anyway while you were in school?
I'M THAT BULL/DIME CHICK, HOW YOU GONNA CHEAT ON ME?).
there are no guys in my school that i would really like so im just waiting for him.
try your best go up to her and ask if she wants to go!
Be strong, be firm, and give it time :)
beach.no couch.maybe i like car,and floor because car=private floor=lots of space!
Trust me I'm NOT flirting with you!!!!!!!!!!
he will walk you to class and pretty much act like a friend.
I guess what I need is some sort of Miricle.
MY X LIKED MY LONG HAIR CAUSE DURING SEX HE PULLED IT.
Well no problem, you are welcome to email me if you still can't find any :)
Well you obviously love her, if not as a lover then surely as a friend.
not having sex however if you cant wait condoms with the pill
but divorce really do scare the shit out of some people, man or woman.
if your guy does not tell how pretty you are than he is self centered
hang out with her a bunch.
they don't know what they have they are stupid
if u are serious take one pill for best result .
if he not , well look for someone else
NO WHAT I DID HE STILL STOOD.COULDN'T STOP IT.
That way it would be easier for us girls!
poor u thats a tough situation.
Spend one day doing what he likes, the next doing what you like.
Im 17 and I was just wondering if that is legal.
but there comes a time to take a good hard look at life.
And being gay is wrong, so it overeating, smoking, cussing, littering, creating smog from driving.
There are some folks out there that are just not nice no matter what you do.
But do it FOR your wife.
blondes are too fake and flashy......brunettes can last
a sports item somethin really boy like
hang out with him for a while then ask him out on a date
Just because he doesnt have a cam doesnt really mean anything.
I'm totally all for asking a guy out.
hahahahaha..........im getting married in February of 2010
Rather u should be proud of it... its an achievement... Live Life King Size...
did you try to talk to her about it ?
Take his lousy ass to the cleaners.
maybe he loves she a lot, or maybe your bro is peaceful
Pretty please :) I'll be your best friend.
Depends on the girl I'm seeing.
just shout if i cn help with anythn.
its okay to like different things, it won't hurt you guys.
I don't believe I've ever heard it put that way.
just worry about you and your man.
They fall out because guyz turn wussy after a while...
might be less then 18 who knows and who cares.
plus, i had my best girls around me, that was great for everything!
well it really depends on how much you care for her!
go to craigslist.com go to women seeking men.
It matters wat point in life your at.
well it really depends on how much you care for her!
go to craigslist.com go to women seeking men.
i have a major crush on my friends exboyfriend.
i say kiss, then take off his pants, and you know the rest....
It matters wat point in life your at.
Just ask her the way i asked my boyfriend
a nympho can only be a girl.
Some guys just want to have a girl whose younger.
yes ,belive me, you can do it with me.
Hope this helps you more than it has helped me :-/
If this scares him away, then you did not need to be with him now.
Get out of the situation ASAP!!!
may b ur asking will u get married by oct 2006?
they r just sick and rong i have no idea y they would
but u know u might have a really good chance k!!!
WE CAN'T EVEN HOLD A CONVERSATION ANYMORE AND WE USED TO SIT UP AND TALK ALL NIGHT.
i don't think it would b proper to date your best friend.
Dude I can understang what you are feeling right now...
ask him to his face, and see how he responds.
yeap... why do you fear off?
No, there are 10,000's more exactly like that out there too :)
That being said, move on with your life - enjoy it!
they say they don't mean it but their lying.
Vin Diesal, The Rock, def not Arec Barrwin
Don't worry so much about what people think.
go wear it and do it.
18 or older anything below ur still a kid
would you fight for your love?
go find her brother (the 18 yr olds)
dont just  listen to ur heart but use ur mind too...MUAH!
interupted by my husband, and you took off so fast,,darn it....lol
im an scorpio and i know!
his sister said he only shows off to me.
OK SWEETIE.I HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO ME.
If he's overly threatened by this after only 3 weeks...run!!!
it keeps you interested and caring.
If there's a Build A Bear Workshop in your town, that always works!
his priorities are out of wack.
or are you a girl and are just curiouse?
how about taking a trip to the dr first off and make sure nothing is really wrong.
walk up ot him and say...Hi.....
it is all up to you..
his buddies there will give him shit about it.
i go seven or eight minutes and im done, i need a sandwhich and a beer
don't you watch the series friends??
Are you actually in love with her, or are you in infatuation, lust, or some other emotion?
i forgot to give the courtesy tap
just say want to go out on friday or he asks you out
Oh girl.. don't get me started.
ALOTT -lol maybe thats because my man is deployed overseas and it's been awhile...
swinging is ok if your into that, I think it's best to be with just one person.
you know what i'm talking about?
forget who  everyone thinks you should date.
By the way, GOOD BIRTHDAY, DEAR!
Masturbation is normal, don't let them tell you its not........lol
young girls usually don't date guys their age .
or is it too early to know?
You can't amek him love you, though.
You probably don't want to forget your mother, you probably hang on to her things and her ways.
afterwards you and some friends should go out.
that could ruin her entire life and marriage.
some guys are nice and some guys are too kind!
but i guess it's best i didn't.
hi im mostafa from egypt im search at good girl to marry
If he says your cool or fun to be around then.
Starts looking nice everyday for no reason at all.
More power to you ...enjoy it while it lasts!
If things go wrong then you know what you have to do.
How would u feel when a 35 year old man have sex with ur 18 year old daughter.
its like rigt under the head.......y
You, me, and my dad all agree dude.
and do you really want sloppy seconds?
But a guy doesnt care when or where.
That is just what I went through.
there is already another guy that is going for her.
When you aren't looking is when yuo will find them.
see if he really likes you or not coming from a guy
yeah the breaking up and then j/k.
Half of my friends are guy's and I see them as my brothers.
Sit on him and rub around.
If this 18 year old man makes you happy...get your swirve on!!
i have always followed my heart and now it's leading me to you wat do u think!!!!!!
Think this way - if you were married, would you want YOUR wife banging some guy on the side?
If she freaks out she cares, if she says see ya then she doesn't.
Ok, part 2 since now I have more info.
show him that you like him to and he will be more comfortable to ask!
wat ys'll think i should do?
its alot easier unless ur shy.
if i had a lot to lose id say yes!
Ask your mate what they like.
they probably cheating or don't trust you.
just b really lucky and wait for her to break up??
I'm looking for some sexy, classy lingerie for size 3x and up.
I have tried to have sex with my wife but it just won't work.
Start looking at him the way you use to.
but i got a pretty good answer, flirt.
I do not see you as shy.
you can marry a fist cousin if you want to
you dont trust her that much
it just means you care about them.
Turn him on in any way u can!
is there anybody that know what im going though does anybody have any answers.
just to get a peice of a.s.s.
BEE NIICEE, LOOK GOOD WEAR GOOD CLOTHES...THAT SHOLD DO IT!
I wonder if avatars have nice personalities!?!
whenever i talk to a boy he says back off to however im talking to
tell her your sick and tired of hearing about her ex's
why do u have to choose?
NOOOO CHRIS BROWN is Not CUTe HES 2 light Skinned And Tall
the you already no the answer.
So why would you need a same sex marriage?
the sex with 2 scorpio is the best shit out there!
NO TONGUE KISSING on the first date!
not necessarily chaeting he could just find you boring
Some guys are really just for friends.
I wouldnt worry too much about it.
YOU NEED TO TELL HER PARENTS OR A TEACHER
don't give in when he wants nothing more than sex.
yes i think it can be possible
Sounds like you think it is, so maybe better if you didn't.....
)and his co will look into it.
I pretty sure he likes me too.
I think you know what I mean (in the sack).
It takes alot but if you don't love why jerk yourself around.
cuz we always have to lose them to regain peace and quite.
Just think about what an *ss he was and that should help.
sound like he's thinking with the wrong head to begin with.
yes of course because red is one of my favorite color.
, so this would   not be real friendly relations but some kind of  ,,compassion,, .
my advice; get out you know you're not happy why are you still there?!?
well, first you actually have to meet a europian lady...that would help.
unzip his pants while watching espn and blow him hard
I dont think im gonna answer this q...
No, get to know each other first....then see what happens...
Why would u want someone that broke up with u?
TAKE THIS FROM A DOCTOR YES YOU ARE A VIRGIN TILL YOU HAVE INTERCOURSE AND YOU ARE PENITRATED
if your scared to tell her cause you might get hurt.
depends on what you mean by arranged!
There are some pretty hot black guys out there.
n e way here wat i think u should do!
it's like boobs...and like sex or something.
Umm sounds like any average crush!!
One would go as far as to say women don't even know why they do it...they just do.
den bam she'll either answer or prob not tell u cuz u kno dem n she think  gon tell.
you get his number and you call him.
u should w8 til your married.
I'm with Rascal on this one - plus, get photos like One said.
Im 14 and Im Ashley's older sister.
Not like in problem solving, but like taking out the trash.
How much more EX do you want...??
don't be stupid, find someone you love.
Why aren't you supposed to like him?
But  I dont think you are a lesbian.
Don't worry sweetie, it won't last.
go on with your life being happy.
Do whatever you want, just don't get in trouble.
what can i do to better my chances in getting back together with her?
I'm not gonna sneak around as if we're doing something bad!
She's your EX Get real (and I hate it when Phil says that)
THE GUY DOESN'T NEED TO EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE IT IF THE LADY DOES!!!
I did...well, sort of after my first try.
she then has to grow up at a very young age and act like an adult.
were are you from i am in washington dc
all that getting along with your life is bullshit.
Wait until one comes to you
He is cute and i realy like him i know he likes me but.... his sister she hates me!
adultry is a serios offense (artical 134 u.m.c.j.
dude come on now its your first cousin think of the kids man the kids!
and you will not waste anymore time on what if!
a lover is easyer to find than a real friend think about it
find one that use to be nerdy
He's so good looking and he can sing!!
Some girls might think it's funny and pull out the make-up bag.
well, unless u turn to a nun, u will cose u'll get married.nature talks
Some women, like men, worry about their performance.
I just don't care about them simply.
If you like her and she's taken then MOVE ON!!
i try my best 2 be strong but im not im weak when it comes 2 that.
i don't care what age you are or if you are having sex....
Look, so she doesn't like potatoes.
Most of the gals like guys who do some bad.
Nothing too big or serious, its the first date, you've got time!!
your 13, why dont you wait until you grow pubic hair first
You just need to coax it.
Well, I've been cheated on before & it was horrible & nothing but a nightmare!
yes if hes fine and cute yes
he was just afraid to pursue them.
Oh, and he also doesn't drink.
sound like she needs to let that go...
thanx for ur opinion, but i was actually jst kidding.
Hope you find what you're looking for!
jealousy all starts with trust and that starts with honest.
If he ikes to watch T.V.
WHAT SHOULD I DO TO MAKE HIM FALL IN LOVE WITH ME AGAIN?
meet his friends ask them questions
if not why dont you just forget about it all and just let the past remain in the past.
THE 2 OF YOU WOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY, AND WOULD JUST END UP CHEATING, AND HATING EACH OTHER!
'_' do u have an internet love?!
Don't settle for some jerk or cheater - you deserve better!!!
I have really good friends who are girls and we are just friends..
yea i got some of friends who are girls
yea that way wen ur married it wont hurt that much and ull be expirienced boys like tat
chat with me .... saleem_nawaz and we will talk briefly....
I know I told plenty of guys that but I meant it.
If you trust her and love her let this go.
why are you messing around with a married women in the first place???
Its not a question of courese EMINEM!!!!!!!!
lmao, u must really lik dis gurl lol!
even women like a little challenge
Take a long time to please a girl.
just waiting and shooting th' bull until something comes up.
Run a hot bath and then undress her and put her in the tub.
I have lots of female friends and my wife knows that and trusts me.
A good guy will respect you for it in the long run!
just ease it as it comes
SHE'LL LOVE YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.
but do we get it .
and if you don't then it is your problem .
mail it or give a friend to give the letter.
it's possible, but it could be some guy tht's 97 with gray hair and wrinkles
but she wuz a bytch and really didnt treat him right anyways so it wasnt too hard.
If you are not attracted to women.
do not mess with either one of them because it could mess up the relationship
Ask him why he's staring at you.
And of course they don't tell them that up front.
HOW COME I ONLY ATTRACT THE BROKE, GOT 500 KIDS, CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS KIND OF GUY?

tell them every thing you know and to watch out.
would it be any different if the guy was younger and the girl was older?
Most people do not know why they did or did not do something.
I CANT BELIEVE ANY OF YOU WOULD THINK OTHERWISE.
he is only playing games with you
and you still wanna hang around with her?
(yes i did prowl, i didn't think i had anything to worry about.)
Just take it as a gift, and enjoy!
She is just thinking like a typical woman .
i manipulated him...it may have been wrong but it worked and thats all i wanted.
it just gets the police involved
for the most part they are ripoffs.
Ha, no he still doesn't care about you.
i can handle both at one time
if she left u get over it she is a loser if she dos not love any more
most say they aren't really so happy.
Try to connect with the person and if you can't don't even go there
yes, you do what makes you happy, be with who makes you happy, don't worry what other people think.
forget her find someone who really love you
Well, if you think about it, gay guys have sex with other men.
i dont think it is tho.
white 5-6in hispanics 7-8in black 7-9in.
dump him she can do better.
U r not going nuts if that is what you are asking.
Maybe the girl for you is just not in your school.
Mostly brunettes but blondes are kewl 2
She's gonna lay down and luxuriate in some REALLY GREEN grass.
yes right now and i dont know if he likes me but i know i like him!
BTW ... My GF isn't Bi or tried it but finds it a turn on also.
if so, then i would say so.
Just ask him or don't if you nevr wnt 2 know!!
his just trying 2 protect  his gurl
when i look at a girl of couse at first we see looks.
invite him to your next wedding
It's a tough spot.....I feel for you.
not all men are bad eggs.
well when i was 13 i already had had 4 boyfriends
colors lavendar/white wedding in april  fresh cut flowers in huge vases on head table.
Do not try to be someone you are not.
if you both want to it is
first, it is love that makes sex real good.
If she doesn't like potatoes, just eat YOUR potatoes and let her eat whatever SHE wants to eat.
She likes buying shoes and you don't, but that doesn't mean she stops buying.
some guys are stupid i guess
madam, you see wich one likes you, first
I'm kyla, nice to meet u.
Happy Wedd'n Day.And if Not Too Late Get A karookee Machine
What do you think she's gonna do the SECOND you BORE/ANNOY/TICK HER OFF??!??
i think its cool.. heck im a guy id be happy if a girl asked me out.
And if he is cheating you need to do what is best for you and only you.
TRUE LOVE IS NOT LIKE THAT OF INFATUATION WHICH COMES HURRIEDLY AND GOES AWAY QUICKLY .
WE DON'T EVEN ACT LIKE FRIENDS, AND WE CAN GO MONTHES WITHOUT BEING INTAMITE.
One caveat, there are sexy 33 year old guys too :P
Its not as complicated as a guy asking a gurl out.
AFTER HE PUT THE RING ON MY FINGER HE HAD NO INTEREST IN ME ANYMORE.
NOT AT 13 HA,HA,HA  IT'S 18 YEARS OLD.MEN AND WOMAN, IN THE U.S.A.
It sounds like absolutely nothing is wrong with you!
USE THEM AS EXAMPLES AND THEYLL REALIZE HOW UNFAIR AND CHILDISH THEY ARE BEING.
well i do nothing as always u know get on the comp.
i don't think you should drop out.
I know because I am mature, DUH!
It's a great way to hang out.
It's a great way to hang out.
i don't think so.......at least not close friends
SOME HAVE MIXED FEELINGS AND DON'T KNOW WHEATHER OR NOT THE LOVE YOU OR NOT.
buff as in bigger arms than normal, very strong.
it isnt good or bad, its just a personal opinion.
and DONT ever go back even if he says he has changed cause that never happens.
I would dump him and get out now!!!
If he really is out there for me then when in the hell is he going to get here!
Say Hiii or Helloo..and be nice!
theyve been going out for about....2 months now.
i think u r joking no man has a problem like that
never wound his ego and always try to understand where he is coming from.
if he ignors everyone else to listen to what you have to say.
i can't stand 2 c girls dying over some guy who doesn't even know they exist.
I see a lot of guys with self-esteem problems trying to make tons of money.
If she really didnt like the guy, it shouldent matter.
WHETHER YOU THINK SO OR NOT, THIS GUY HAS A EMOTIONAL HOLD ON YOU.
and without love, people would be like dogs that do sex without love.
just hang out more and talk to him and flirt a little when your both hanging out
That way no matter what it is all in the end.
she said that he liked me.
meet somewhere, be honest and tell him why.
Just be ur self and do wot ur heart tells at that time when u see that guy
when i first met my babys daddy he was the picture perfect guy.
well i am not a big loving person but, i do know what love is all about.
They say he just doesn't go with me.
(but next time to someone I know better!)
Heck he still gives me goose bumps!
The kids thing makes the sex part really hard.
but he doesn't buy u gifts at all not even 4 ur birthday or holidays that involve getting gifts??
sleep with his brother or best friend
Way too old to be on here with you kids!
just let your friend be with him make her feel happy
watz your name and why do she hafta be a different race?
I thought I was in love.
First off it has to do with how old u r.
Then ask him to stop staring.
A CHILD SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GROW UP AND LISTEN TO FUSSING AND VIOLENCE.
in my experience it rarely lasts
THE ONLY THING WITH THAT IS YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
if sister told you to hold on, then come back, she's not here.
Only if you like a lot of sex.
But some guys cover it up by marrying women.
now that i answered it im not so bored any more... hey thanx!!!
I'm having a Napolean Dynamite moment... umm... you could do as pedro does and make her a cake(?)
get to know him drop hints that u like then u never know he might ask u out
the shy ones may just stare at you because they are scared to do anything else.
he says d sweetest things 2me n abt me.
and feelings (love included) come and go.
;^) Seriously, I think it's like that because they don't know who or what they want.

HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU THAT YOU ARE A FREAKIN LOSER?
i think you should stop eating them
i have been through this before and the only thing that seems to work is kindness.
Ask him straight up dont hesitate.
What is it that I am not doing or shouldn't be doing.
First of all is she the one for u, then u shouldn't worry about being embarrased.
Nobody should be anybodys punching bag it is just wrong.
I have heard that brunette is just Latin for blonde wanna be  :-p
of course it's possible  have fun
They always want the bad boys.
ANYONE who says .... hi, is girl and who says hello is woman.... JUST OBSERVE....
hmmm...june 2006.  sounds like he needs to graduate from somewhere, perhaps?
She was not the One  Why?
I have 3 different friends, neither 1 of them know one another.
If you're interested only in sex, then how about not marrying anyone?
ask her for a date and she'll go with 'ya!
IF THEY DONT UNDERSTAND, GIVE THEM TIME.
(GOOD AND BAD) Like being married there is good and bad.
Its col but of course i never ask guys out...To many of them ask ME out.
He hasnt told her because he wants to bang you.
if your kids grow up around that it makes them more likely to turn out that way!
i'm 19 and still looking for a man that is the true!
you only have one life 2live so live.
your kids will grow up and think this is okay and its not.
When we got married i weighed 98lbs now I weigh 140.
(man do i miss it, can you tell???)
I do not see what's wrong with you looking at a another woman and saying oh she looks nice.
THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF GUY HE IS BUT BOTH I GUESS
I really like the girl so I want it to be cute.
YOUR ACTIONS WILL KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE AND ON THE RIGHT PATH.
remember you are a helper love on him and encourage him.
Of course men want that, (whats wrong with you?)
i am very sorry to say, but i think he likes her!
Have you ever done anything to her to make her not lke you?
i going to wait tell after i am married
So take the time to look inward and then go get him!
it was weird...i was surprised and like...wait people LIKE this??
well yeah if you tell her and shes normal herself shes sure to drop ya!
you can flirt with him sometimes when you hang out, but don't overdo it.
Funny stuff ;)  BTW theres nothing wrong with what youre doing, just be honest with him.
I know that dating a guy is soo wrong!
meanwhile warm up on some older ladies (those that are 5-10 years older).
I THINK MANY PEOPLE GET LUST CONFUSED W/ LOVE.
yes if he or she is ugly, or drunk.
if you started with nothing together, a pre nup would be a slap in the face.
Just show him that u are there for him and show him your love gradually.
I don't know EVERYTHING about my wife's past.
At least its better than having four husbands!
because they what toget some of that sexy thing
And, I don't mind staring at some men, either.
talk about the postive and negative
R u serious.....wonder how many people would jump at this question ?
YES, & IT SHOWS U HAVE GOOD TASTE!!!
There are just too many questions...
Strange thing, HE MARRIED HER, and she him.
IT'S NOT REALLY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST THAT THEY ARE CONFUSED.
preying on young girls is NEVER acceptable.
please, do yourself a favor and leave!
What ever happened to being a real MAN which is what you need!
to be able to spend time with you .
Your defensive attitude says it all...YOUR TOO YOUNG!
Take his hand in yours ... and ask him out!
* lust at first sight, yes.
he would have to pay alimony for the rest of her life or until she gets remarried.
i feel like i can do better on my own.
sometimes he just does sex in bathrooms and other seedy places and she never knows.
That means that if one spouse is caught cheating, the other gets EVERYTHING and he gets screwed.
SAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT FOR A CUP OF COFFEE SOMETIME?
yes but it should be kept for marraige only!
One thing with blue, is that there aren't many blue flowers.
This guy sounds like it, too.
girls like guys with skills   ex:  handy man , bowstaff, personality.
As long as sex has to be thought about (Does he like it?
I love my boyfriend to death.
:) lol, I hope this sheds some light on the subject.
If you left her i dont think shell want you back
Now I see why it's best to wait.
THIS IS AN EASY ONE AND I THINK MOST OF YOU ARE WRONG.
being 18 is a hard time.
Some lubrication (KY JElly) and a lot of foreplay.
and wait for the right single guy.
and if she says no ask her questions to why.
1- You should be good guy outside and inside.
also you should tell the police
if possible the woman should just seperate for a while.
Great question, but the answer is 'not as many as I do' :)
OK...guys are typically bad at gettting the subtle hints.
just the thought of it makes me sick.
jealousy can turn into abuse very fast...be careful
CAUSE SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING TO YOU!
my bf is just like that its so weird over protecteing
& YEAH HE LIKES U IF HE BUGS U LIKE CRAZY!!!!
Best man I've ever had and plan on keeping him forever!
then i tried to pursue him again and he pulled away once more.
like to xchange photos or the tel no first?
Hey you guys are in love.
boys start after youve done it.
also, they wouldn't get used to the life style.
Currency: Indian rupee (INR) - US$ 1  = INR 46.13 (July 2004).
I sure as hell wouldn't want somebody like you around....  Jesus!
You're cheating on him with your boyfriend!
I think of sex a lot.
guys r jerks but they would do that so they can get into girls pants.
do you know how it is for a kid to know their mom is getting abused?
Boy friends and girl friends come and go... don't let your freindships go because of some lame guy.
BET ON PAPER CHITS.... who wins.... go for him.... almost everyone man is like other....
i think you should get a cool new style
If not on your honeymoon why would you the day after, or ever?
I give it two thumbs up.
Think about all the thing that yo are good at and go have fun with some friends.
we have one financial crisis after another.
in my case.. its a she any i'd definitely go back to her cu I STILL LUV HER.
Keep yourself busy and stop thinking about when he's gonna call.
im asking this question, to find a toll about how many girls actually fake it and why.
yeah, but hey it it gives the other 40% of us something to laugh at
Maybe you just don't feel ready yet.
Nathan (nā'thən) , in the Bible.
the best way to dump a girl is to be honest
;) Let us know what happened!
but the saying if you love something let it go if it comes by then its for real.
but 5 months doen't really matter
If you dont love her anymore then tell her and dont hurt her.
ya its right along the vane on the underside of tere penis.
sounds fake i knw but i want 2knw wat 2 do.
I like whatever makes me happy and keeps me content  :-)
a lot of times women think well i will just go find a man and show him.
he is so cute...and only 16!!!!!!!!!
but milk your mom and dad for what it is worth
generally because man came first and woman came from man so man has the desire first
hey you still young its a new year maybe luck will strike.good luck
Some people can just cut loose and ask whatever they want because you don't know who they are.
She didn't even know that I gave it to him until last night!
i sure hope ther are no children involved!
I told my best friend and she got mad and we didn't hang out for 2 months.
probably some guy who doesn't broadcast it
Just don't go buying it with their money, or buying something really expensive that they'll never use.
What you see is what you get ladies.
You aren't kissing the right women ;)
Thanks for shining a light on my own life for me!
surround yourself with guy-friends: guys that respect you and that your comfortable with.
man if she says no who cares there is better looking woman in the see
it would take time to 4get things, though...he does it the 2nd time & bam!
Wow...there's alot of conservative people around here.
Good luck I agree with cig.
!hahahahaha now wut u gonna do!?
Find a close friend dat might tell u something about some of ur downsides...pl.
LIES only hurt and they will ALWAYS come back to bite you in the butt.
as long as you love him it's alright.
or it could be a band
Honey, I went to the doctor and I have (insert name of STD here).
my ex cheated so we are broken up.
damn woman, ur 33 n u look my age?
i didn't mean to go out with him.
And oh my God, why would you stay with some married loser anyway.
Instead of hanging out with them, now you hang out with your special someone, yes?
Girls don't usually get mad, they get even.
So be it...she needs a new wardrobe?
She's always there to check you.
And you think you got it from him?
If she cares for you family and friends.
Every time I even thinks she wants to move up a notch though, I just lock up.
Hey I am HOT ........try me !
Just talk to her and treat her like anybody else.
Depends on what you're buying... probably.
We used to do that, why don't we do that anymore?
i'm a hot man-- will that work for you??
I'm not shy around her any other time, so why then?
I'm a girl ask me more.
damn lucky 18 year old bastard.
love hurts because you know if you lost that person, you'd be crushed.
Why not me just e-mail me at sexyniceeyes_15@yahoo
Believe me, you don't- you won't for years and years.
u don't no wat this guy is like.
does it really matter to you?
And you will hit tough times.
soon..if you want..and late if u aren't interested!
If your a man it's different.
what did you do to lose her?
She doesn't hate you, she is just annoyed.
time and experience things with them
when your desires are not fulfilled then this hurts.
If she could do what your mom can do for you.
don't be stupid and don't start dating!
I actually really like this guy.
I gotta be honest, you know!
after that its really a combonation of looks and personality.
make her feel important and special
HOW DOES A RELATIONSHIP GO FROM BEING HOT AND HEAVY TO NO SPARKS AT ALL.
e-mail me so we can hook nup with fine girls on here
yea the truth hurts but he will eventually get over.
my boyfriend and i are having some problems.
who do i chose its so hard.
the why did they ever break up golden couple:  Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt
you can't live together and still go to highschool?
YES SIZE DOES MATTER EVEN THOUGH ITS JSUT ONE FACTOR OF MAKING THA WHOLE EXPEIRENCE PLEASURABLE!!
my best friend's a guy, weve been best friends since we were 2!
i just hope hes not bigger than you are!!
So, bottom line, no -- it would not bother me in the least.
thats a clear sign to break up.
two things help me, i go out running to clear my head or theres always beer.
make a billion dollars in the movies and ask her
i am 13 and there is this really nice girl that just moved here about 4 days ago.
yeah ,but then I ignore Salma Hayek's lawyers who constantly threating me with a RO, muahahahha
ask her the worst thing she can say is no
Normally, women do not buy men gifts at all.
Believe me, everytime you go back to a lost boyfriend it only gets worse and worse.
give him a box of chocolate
then you should say one for you one for me one for you.
your still too young to date i'm not going to date till i'm 18!
All you have to do is touch a guy and hes aroused... lol just joking
HELP is wright hide the kids.
do whatever he wants, especially in bed, whenever he wants to
he turned out to be a jerk.
You DO NOT KNOW THIS GUY HE MIGHT BE ARMED DO NOT MEET HIM.
You might be dump if you make yourself so cheap.
Dumb question but I just thought I'd get people opinions :o) Thanks.
it took u 16 yrs to find out what kind of person her really was.
I am 13 and know what I am doing!
if you are a girl just be friendly n social then you'll   have lots of friends.
Should I give it a chance or end it now?
Believe me im not gay i have a boyfriend just relax girl and be yourself allright?
this will make you a easier person to hang out with and you will have some friends.
dont drag a relationship and make him think you love him.
he will give you one .
(Not to mention she typed all in caps, and it was one big run-on sentence...sheesh)
i would tell him eye to eye.
13 is way too early to date.
Maybe the guy that is mean to you likes you!!
HOW CAN YOU LOVE SOMEONE, WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ANY OF THEIR INNER CHARACTERISTICS (PERSONALITY)?
well is your bf gay or fat?
Or just suck it up and hope they break up.
JUST THE DECEPTION ALONE IS WRONG.
First of all...if all he's doing is staring, that's not stalking.
y wud u want a friend u dont no?
If so all Puerto Rican men would be taken!
you deserve better, and snooping isn't as bad as what she did... BY FAR!
why can't girls buy the stuff they want with thier own money?
in a relationship, one person is always chasing...if u dont chase her, she will come running
intelligent,even, along with her 3 siblings.
Dump him, and find a real man!
i would love to know too...   Maybe twice?
tell me a way to get her to stop this madness!
I'm in love with my boss and he's married.
Laugh at your jokes, listen to your tough day at work stories?
wat is the sexiest way to masturbrate?
He is an adult at 18 (by law) and you are a minor at 15 (by law)!!
love is blind, so who cares about race.
i just want to know !!!!!!!
I agree he is the hottest!!!!
i used to but no ever really responds beyond the key board they are all afraid
he if an other guys going for her let them be.
question is who doesnt like him.
Thing is that I don't like him.
if not one time you will have to let him go.
well, you got that right, try switching to the other hand,
Some of my best friends are men.
Is that what you really want?
If they want it again then BAMB they call sooner than later.
maybe he does like you i mean my friend ended up going out with a guy she completely hates.
As for when to take it off... never!
this don't sound good at all.
DON'T LISTEN TO GIRLS...THEY'RE SO DRAMATIC.
But I want thing back the way they were and so do they.
chance are, your friends are just jealous 'cause this guy is crazy over you.
or should i have a good argument because this stuff should have never have happened..??
with knowing this info your halfway there.
go get a life men u r sick
just wondering i really doubt it though
LOVE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN OUTTER APPEARANCES.
aint even no question about it CHRIS BROWN!
i couldnt understand why bcuz he said he loved me.
and set ground rules for what is and is not allowed before you ever start out.
Then you start exersising like crazy, dieting and all that good stuff.
normal..dont worry about it..just stare at other men
I can't believe she did not have sex with anybody either!
UH....different for everyone..red, yellow, blue, green, black, purple, yellow, pink....
go on and enjoy the greatest thing on earth!
your first mistake was telling her you liked her when she had a bf.
i think you should tell her.
would you nag and say stupid things with her/him?
Do you always let her pick the movie and the restaurant?
I laughed my ass off for 10 minutes when I read this question
Why not both pink and blue?
Some girls just play hard to get because they know how weak you guys can get.
Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
Even if he is, who cares?
try to let her know that u r still alone and waiting for her
then once you get off of the phone listen to the radio or put on your favorite cd.
NONE...don't do out side your race...it should be a crime...
I mean it all depends on what they look like.
so older guys and younger girls balance out.
they want you to stop listening to the crap you listen to
Butt juice HAHAHA...on that note I'm going to sleep
Well if you don't and found out he is what you wanted will you be kicking yourself later ?
i'm looling for him to get his e-mail
yes it happens a lot ot people
If you can't be wit the one you want  love the one your wit
simple .... get her phone no and call....
I believe that once a cheater, always a cheater.
it's totally cool to let a      make a move!
Will my friends think I'm an idiot for liking her?
I'm not attic cat but we can be friends!
because its a womans job to complain and a mans job to fix things.
spend the of rest your life reminding him and others what they lost n wish they had.
your not going to get over not trusting him completely.
And he's actually talking about working things out?NO IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!
I liked her but she did not like me.
even doe he doesnt want anyone to know about us i still love him.rember im only 13.
Boys are just aiting for this moment
find someone who can make you happy too.
my personal favorite: hey baby, we'll be having sex later tonight, you might as well be there.
the answer  could be a million things
Just like Sarah said, does he make you happy?
I HAVE REALLY FALLEN IN TRUE LOVE .
Love's always real, rest is just infatuation.
drop a peanut in her boobs and say, Oops, there go's my dinner...can i buy yours?
not to mention you would probably hate the last name anyways.
Who put that crap in your head.
Fantasies are just that - fantasies.
eg..eye contact etc etc if yes jst ask
give it a little time, if its a fresh breakup, before you persue this guy.
visit any person from opposite sex .... at lonely place.... and try.... may be you learn....!!!
for the same reason guys tease girls when they like them
what would your kids do with out you and what would they be exposed to with out you.
cause they are full or someone dosent want you in there
find some guy you like, flirt, sit on his lap.
i don't thing there is love at first sight.
like when trying to ask her out or like making her think you are interested in her
I gave this boy named Clayton a HUGE bar of chocolate for Christmas, (I even wrapped it!)
save yourself please, don't do it.
....meaning that the vagina looses its strengh and becomes rather loose and men find it difficult to enjoy intercourse?
keep things the way they are now, yea?
I guess the easiest way would be to ask why is he hangs around you.
Auctions and then changed my mind and I no longer want it.
Even at his age, he STILL looks sexy as all hell.
they feel like they are the king (most off the time!!!)
what a hypocritical thing to say.
You know that you have to ask out girls....
well it depends on why she left you.
well, if he gay or bi-curious, tell him .
athletic guys as in average joe build.
yeah did that and it was not great.
Did he try to make it up to you?
will he eventually have it happen again?
if you have to ask the question is he having an affair.
(No, really, don't pick me...I'm fat, ugly & married with 2 kids).
Well I'm a shy guy so I know all about this.
get a life and be patient for things in their right time.
It is not bad at all!
....Because men say you are a nice girl, and you are not!
not very good sex but hey you broke the plain so its sex just the same
Oh yeah and it's two not to...
18... doesnt make any sence though I was waiting for the right one and he wasnt it either.....
only guys they see that has popularity, looks, or money.
It depends I guess, Im a girl, but love can make people do crazy things.
i am a much different person than i was with him.
NO IT DOES NOT  think with your head, not your heart.
I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WAS SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN WITH HER WEDDING RINGS ON AND THE DIAMOND FELL OUT.
A guy wouldn't think much of 140lbs.
OK...this might sound harsh, but it is not all women, just the ones that you pick.
I just need some advice I guess...
No guy is worth having sex with to keep - especially when you're 15.
if she is threatining you w/ something, tell!
2 answers for the question, he might be thinking of you or he don't....
Especially if you have no fricken friends left to hang out with because they're all married.
dude, no no no no no
It's not the meat...it's the motion!
tell him whats on your mind.
and it is sex that would make love spicier.
It wouldn't be the same, and you really wouldn't like it.
i need all the help i can get!!!
yes you should its hard to find a guy that will say that out right!
If you love your husband help him understand what you need and what u like.
YOU'RE A GAME TO HIM, AND IF YOU MOVE ON TO SOMEONE ELSE HE'S LOST THE GAME.
no if your a girl yes if your a boy
SO STOP CALLING HIM AND WATCH HE CALL YOU AND MAKE UP A LIE FOR NOT CALLING YOU.
be honest and tell him nicely what u think, and tell him the truth.
I try to act like I'm happy but I kinda feel hurt and betrayed...
NOW THAT I END UO MARRIES THE MOST PREFCIT MAN IN THE WORLD
Theres ways to Spice things up.
I care for this woman but don't really want a relationship with her.
if you ever let him know how you feel and hope he feels ya back!
find a better guy no matter how hot he is.
michael vartan, definitely --- ohh such a hottie!
I don't think it's bad or good...
if you truly want to be a friend, say no way!
I just like him as a friend.
Personally, I don't really think sex gets you anywhere with guys, they just want some.
You know the saying, Once a THEIF always a THEIF.
just go up to him and ask
You just have to learn to except the change or don't.
tell him how u feel duhhh
i mean there r so many ppl in this world.
they say they're not, but some pictures of them seem pretty snug and cozy...
some roses and a heart and tell him that u love him
when you're done with all that crying, pick yourself up & meet different people,have fun!
I really didn't believe her but then Nickleback dropped her off at my house.
But just like the other guy said, guys don't like girls playing hard to get.
If that don't work, then dump him & move on.
Pick your nose and flick the boogers at her.
Now, you've conquered, you've learn much, the good, the bad, the ugly, the dumb, etc.
U will know WHEN you two have that FIRE in your EYEs.
Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
Y act a way that is gonna make u unhappy just to impress a guy.
very difficult to forget first love
the best revenge is to not look pathetic and be strong.
theres this grl, n im stuck on her.
you have to go w/ your heart and be honest
60% is an underestimate... probably more like 85%!
let me know what you think!
in because i wanted to see how people would react.
wants to have it again............easy to read men.
And, the real question then becomes why do I pick women who cheat?
something that show you love them
Wait a while so your mixed feelings subside, but if they don't maybe you should just stay friends.
Go do fun things he would like.
it can to certian people...thats what a foot fetish is...
Hell no, he's only 3 years old.
being gay is often a sad lonely thing.
gurl u aint no lesbian u just cant live without your x-bf so dont worry everytins gonna be alright
no but if you find one can you find one for me ?
because life's 2 unfair 2 get a hottie that's nice
if there are no kids around... any where!
yes i made it up and I AM NOT A LIAR!
Maybe she is tring to make you jelous.!
This is what I did for my guy friends: I cooked for them!
but its against the law in some states.
uh...I wouldnt think so...ashley's older than zac by like...2 years though...I dont think they ever will date...IMO
and after all that you wont have to worry about getting a girl to like you.
Just because men and women can and do become attracted to each other, doesn't mean they all do!!!
I've french kiss a lot of women.
This could also be a gang thing...
it's not the best idea though...
I don't know does he love me?
you've caught him TWICE don't u think that's enough?
Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
My boyfriend is drop dead sexy.

I bet a real pic of you would be better!
and answer peoples Q. like urs.
Read the book (I kissed Dating Good Bye)
But not a big kiss, maybe just a peck.
She is probably suffering from some sort of phsycological disorder that should be addressed SOON!!!!
the louder the better b/c they'll actualy talk to u first instead of us guys making the first move.
thanks for ur time to read this :)
tell him to leave you alone forever!!
SO I SIT DOWN AND WROTE EVRY THING I LOVED ABOUT HIM DOWN.
we had been friends for about 4 years and i had dated his bestfriend for that 4 years.
tell a friend then ask that girl.
do things that u will normally NEVER think of doing.
i bet there are lots of things that she eats that you hate, right??
Hugs...If i was there with you, i would demonstrate, ha ha ha.
Oh, and buy her gift certificates to Victoria's Secret ;)
and you are pretty sure you feel the same way about both people.
start by trying to just meet people.
If he cheated on you, why would you want to stay with him???
The type of guy who doesn't buy you gifts .
they have no respect for their father at all!
Wait,I say wait on the Lord.
i madeout w/ her lik 4 months ago.
but think about this, there's a reason that she broke up with him.
DO NOT WEAR YOUR PLATINUM AND DIAMONDS IN THE OCEAN OR ANY OTHER BODY OF WATER BESIDES THE SHOWER!!!!
First of all, if you're asking a guy, the answer is 'There is NO sexy way!'
just for all teens teens games
titty flick 'em and don't be shy about it
well not really i mean ur girlfriend is going to be with you
Can't say that I still do cuz I am happily married.
But, if you are a virgin when you get married how would you know???
Honey almost eveyone has that what if person in thier life.
He seems to be nice, but let's face it, I DON'T KNOW HIM!!
be realistic about who u are looking for in a date.
u can e-mail me with any porbs u have people call me the broken heart fixer.
go out and work on you.
Cause the women their age (dont want them)
Love doesn't mean sex nor does it mean a relationship it just is...
Well I am gay as well and looking but am not in real good shape.
Besides, who does he go home with at the end of date?
get him something nice maybe a shirt or find something that he loves
Some guys because they want something from you like some ass.
bushmaster is right, plus he is playing
