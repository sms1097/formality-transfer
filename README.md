This repo contains all of the work for my senior project and class project for CS 880. <br>
In order to run this code authorization from Yahoo to access the L6 corpus is needed 
and authorization must be shown to Joel Tetreault. Full details can be found [here](https://github.com/raosudha89/GYAFC-corpus)
